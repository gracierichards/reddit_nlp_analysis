The fact that this Jam Jar can K.O. you instantly is honestly the scariest thing in Omori,1083
Oh he wearing a suit or am I just eating his insides? The world may never know...,421
They did not need to make his battle music such a banger but I’m glad they did,275
This is 10/10 lmfao. . Hero just in the corner of the screen cowering in fetal postion is my favorite part,187
I fear life jam man.,159
I'd pay to see a brawl between Life Jam Man and Kool-Aid Man,67
Beautiful. I love it.,50
To show you the power of life jam, I have committed massacre on these poor little innocent children,38
omg this is SO accurate I'm laughing really hard right now xD thanks you made my day,31
i want to know if i can skip him until max lvl then come back to take my revenge from previous saves.. . i want to think he stops attacking when he expects you to revive the others , so having the last one not revived could ensure to kill him (at least aubrey does massive damage if she lands a critical),29
r/churchoflifejamguy,26
That's just good marketing tbh,21
He beats the shit out of everyone and then force you to use the life jam, what a monster,19
life jam man is the deadliest thing. forget the monsters/demon shadow thingies.,16
The exact kind of chaotic energy I need in my life.,10
YO HE'S FUCKIN D E A D,9
LMAO oh no,9
I LOVED THIS i just finish the game and this is the first post i saw INCREDIBLE,10
I though he was gonna give me free food, but suddenly he just kills all my friends and I was like WHY?!,8
OMORI IS GONE,6
Its the Kool Aid man on a jar,4
Hey, this is the sub's top post! (For now),5
to be fair, he is inspired by kool aid man, a guy who can destroy walls unharmed, and that he is glass,3
“OH YEAH!!”,3
I can't believe this is the highest upvoted post on this sub,3
Life jam,2
Cool,2
this made me laugh such an ugly laugh i adore it thank you,2
i wasnt expecting to get toasted so hard but i sure did,2
Kel gets kel nuked.,2
Kel got uno reverse card',2
Almost 9999 upvotes,2
He could solo goku,2
Oh no,1
I was so scared when I first did this.,1
Hero needs to stop being a fucking mood /nm,1
I'm dying it's so hard to type this,1
OOF,1
Let me give you a demonstration,1
mutantheart is 75% life jam. . life jam is 100% muscle,1
Close,1

NOOOO KEL,1
POOR KEL LOL,1
This is definitely my head canon of this Jam jar’s strength.,1
Who would win life jam guy or kel nuke,1
Life Jam: It really works!,1
koolaid man be doing godswork,1
OH YEAH!,1
kel: 🍞,1
Did you know that In omori there's a secret boss named sq-why he only attack you in the bad ending,1
Forget something. Life jam guy is the true villain of the game,1
Death jam. ,1
scariest moment in my life,1
why is it top of all time,1
Honestly I agree,280
I'm glad he isn't an enemy,31
The only thing keeping him from an instant game over is the "omori did not succumb" mechanic which exists.,23
im gonna say this before anyone else can, r/cursedcomments,71
Yes.,40
He's like cool aid man, it's his blood.,27
,4
What is the name of the song,52
“I fear no man…”. . “Except Life Jam Guy”,15
If by innocent you mean >!one pushed their sister down the stairs!<, then yeah they’re innocent,13
Innocent?,5
He has infinite HP. Bro is immortal,16
This sub NEEDS to exist,12
still is,6
recognized you from that omori song tierlist series and that fellow phobia mashup thing (it was a banger btw),2
When he offered some free samples I did not think he would just erase my guts. That boy be stronger then my deepest nightmares,355
I still don't have a clear idea of how it works.,9
“Flouring with you”,57
It scares me,3
Really late response but >!Omori didn’t push Mari down the stairs, Sunny created Omori as an alter ego and the main attribute he gave omori is that he never did the thing!<,7
He can’t die, he’s literally **made of life jam**,14
We already made r/churchofkevin.. . We must go further beyond now,14
It exists, it's just private,1
Still is,2
Even if you decline his free sample he still fight you,107
Omori gets one get-out-of-death-free pass per battle, when a hit that would leave him with 0 heart leaves him with 1 instead. The next time he gets a hit that would leave him with 0 heart in the same battle, his heart does deplete and its game over.,18
Unironically a Huge Banger, i have been having it on repeat,3
I forgor,3
Use LIFE JAM!. It really works!,6
Still is,1
It's all for the sake of the Life Jam. . Use LIFE JAM!. It really works!,28
if you don't think you need it I'll MAKE YOU NEED IT,9
>!I forget which battle it was, but one time, I got the "Omori did not succumb." message twice. I think it was Humphrey.!<,8
Like, I sometimes have it happen, then, the very next battle, it happens again, but omori DOES succumb.,2
That's Touhou style music for ya lol,5
It's a glitch that can happen if you heal the same turn you got the "Omori did not succumb" message,5
Huh,2
I’m not sure- either i don’t understand the game well, it doesn’t work for connected battles like Jawsum and Pluto, or you’re not understanding?,2
The ability is called Plot Armor, I believe. If you heal around 10% or more hp on the same turn, you get it back,1
\>official art of grown-up Hero and Mari together. . thank you omocat this is all I needed,1955
It's so fucking wholesome, it hurts. It hurts so fucking much, I love it.,792
Damn, not sure which shirt to buy. The Basil sweater is already sold out, lol.,456
Headcannon/Au: the entire story of omori is a story withing a story, this is just all the actors getting together,392
>!Wait, are we actually getting grown up Mari content?!!<,390
It's been like 20 minutes and some are already sold out,238
Dude this alone brought a genuine smile to my face.. Maybe I got bit too much attached to this characters...,163
I want the kel shirt so badly but still Dk if I should get it or not,110
>!mewo is alive and well!<,106
Sorry Aubrey the omori dystopia shirt stays on during sex,83
Lmao notice how she keeps the eye ambiguous,161
The good ending,69
Everyone is talking about Hero and Mari but..... KEL'S SHIRT MAKES MY HEART GO WOOSH IT'S SO CUTE,132
THE AUBREY SMASH SHIRT SOLD OUT SO FAST 😭😭. . and bro.... grown up mari....😖,56
Ahhhhhh, on one hand, this is so wholesome my heart aches. On the other hand, this is not post-ending photo after all...,54
THIS IS SOOOO CUUUTE AAAHHHHHHHHH,44
I love how Basil is >!blocking Sunny’s eye, and his own eye with his camera!<,41
Mari and hero, grown up, holding hands, im gonna, cry help,41
[deleted],39
**honestly kel and aubrey seem more like the canon couple.** first time i entered the game, i thought omori was gonna be the third wheel and that these two would be the tsundere cold, but then later grew to like each other type of couple. but apparently, omori emits harem energy in his dreams.   .   . kel fits better because for aubrey that hate, can start transforming into a stronger care once they realize their stronger connection. and aubrey viewing omori completely platonic throughout the real series, while shes known for her relationship with kel.,62
The fact that only girls keep both eyes open/unobscured slightly bothers me now that Ive noticed it.,29
Hero and Mari, sitting in a tree~. . >!L I V I N G...!<. . >!I made ^myself ^^saaaad...!<,24
I immediately set this as my desktop background when it was posted, so cute,22
Sunny's shirt is totally not concerning whatsoever. "we live in a society" vibes,21
i love that mari's hair is ambiguously purple! she's so lovely,20
O shit is it out? TIME TO BUY AGAIN,19
Wake up Samurai, we got some T-Shirts to find,17
People who ship both Heromari, Sunflower and ~~Skin Cancer~~ KelBrey : *happy noises*,50
Got the Basil shirt as soon as it dropped!,16
Now hear me out-- what if Mari was wearing the random Hero fan shirt, and Hero was wearing the Mari shirt? Ehh? Ehhhhh??. . Tears, anybody? ;-;,14
>! damn i thought this was gonna be the one thing we see post true ending, but i equally love this just as much,14
Heromari content heromari content ahhhhh,12
I can't tell if them with scleras makes them look more or less normal. . either way they got nice drip,10
\-> Sunny, wake up, Sunny! What do you mean, dream world? Stairs? Drowning? Come on, that performance we had yesterday was amazing! Let's go treat ourselves to a pizza!,11
YES YEEEEEESSSSSSS. 🇾 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇪 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 🇸 ,9
Thank you so much for this. I forgot to set a calendar date for it and you reminded me.,9
Good Ending,10
mari ;-;,7
I was actually so sad when I saw mari because I thought this was cannon,8
The best universe.,8
Idk if Aubrey is blushing over kel or sunny but. . I like to think it's both,6
Beloved Roselily shipping aside, I love Basil's shorts; I want a pair like that.,8
Why yes, I'll take 20 of this poster....wait you mean it's not on sale? Oh....,6
Aubreyblushing(100x),6
*Wear the* "[random hero fan]()" *shirt to confuse non-omori fans and the* "[omori?]()" *shirt to make them think that you're edgy!*,6
YAAAAAASSSS IT WAS MARI INDEED,4
Oh so that‘s MERCH they‘re wearing holy shit I‘ll take your entire stock dude,6
Kel is here. This is canon,6
What if Omori was just a show created by the friend group and this is their merch advertisement/ fun group photo,5
>!Why you covering that eye, SUNNY?!<,9
Just bought two pieces. Get em while they last.,4
My heart just can't bro,4
I can't get over how happy this one makes me, it's so cute!!,3
I thought its was an imagen of everyone after the good ending, but if Mari is there, its just means its not the after of the good ending.. I still love it tho, i buy the postcard.,4
I'm gonna cry,3
my heart is jumping in joy,3
I can't. . . I need this in my room,3
From the first teaser email I had my heart set on basils shirt, I’m so happy I got to get it since usually all the merch sells out before I can even look at it,3
I have never had the anxiety I did trying to buy this merch. . &#x200B;. . but I got my boi Sunny's shirt and a poster so I am beyond stoked,3
Awww, I love all these dummies so much,3
you forgot goku. I fixed this error for you. . ,3
Wait thats Mari’s ghost or,8
wait, did mari dye her hair purple in this image like she said she would? I'm not good at seeing purples, I see them more black or blue,2
They were actors,2
Wait this implies that if Mari lived, AubreyKel would be a thing ?,2
WAIT HOL UP- MATIRI IS ALIVE?!?!?!?!!,2
i want all the merch but i'm not even allowed to play the game lmao,2
I couldn’t get the poster card, life is pain.,2
Flustered Aubrey Is So Cute Omfg,2
How can i get It?,2
"Hey Basil can you lean forward a bit?". . "Why?". . "Nobody needs to be reminded of that.",2
If Mari stood 1ft to the left,2
i love this,2
I swear to God I wanna adopt all of them,2
who took the photo, if not basil though? 🤔,2
This is so awesome! I kinda love this art. This is beautiful,2
Something seems off on omori's T-shirt,2
Where's Goku?,2
SPOILERS!. . It's so nice!! Although... I do not undestand... Why is there Mari and... Real world Aubrey (usually she wouldn't be blushing if nothing happened),1
Hold on did they all always have two forehead bangs?,1
i'd hug aubrey,1
They got to have fun with Mari one last time…,1
Sunny’s eye is covered by Basil’s flower:(,1
Damn, if Mari is on the merch, that means the characters aren't at all like they are in game. Kind of makes me less inclined to buy it, cause these are entirely different characters now.,1
cringe, mari should be dead,-58
the true true ending merch,1
I got the postcard, can’t wait for it to arrive!,1
Does anyone have an hd version?,1
Seems like Headspace got an update.,1
i thought this was after the story cause sunnys eye is covered but mari is there . . oh well,1
Copium merch,1
Why is aubrey blushing. . . Like, because of WHO,1
It's so bittersweet.,1
Sunny casually stands with a shirt on of him ripping his face off as he stands between at leans one of his childhood crushes,1
Anyone here willing to sell me this limited edition postcard??,1
Unachievable happines hurts the most,1
wow what a wholesome looking group of friends, hope nothing bad happens to them...,1
SOBS,1
I love this,1
[deleted],1
This art is beautiful! I would like to make art like that one day!,1
tag it as a meme and since kel is in it grown up mari would be canon,1
good ending,1
,1
Hero over here with hell Mari getting ready for his panic attack,1
It would be cool if there was like a omori 2 but like this time actually have a happy ending,1
Aubrey's face is too good,1
In a world where Mari survives.🥹,1
amazing pic,1
🥹🥹🥹,1
wait why is mari alive,1
This is the copium I needed,1
Just finished the game, god the small details on this art are so good. Kel holding that shitty orange soda, Aubrey and Sunny blushing bc theyre pushed against one another, Basil actually smiling able to take pictures....MARI T\T,1
Honestly, it is kind of perfect.,1
[removed],0
Basil looking fine asf as always,1
mewo and mari are here.. my wallpaper now,1
Anyone else wonder why Mari’s hair isn’t purple,1
,1
Bro im crying 😭,1
im more freaked out that they actually have eye whites,1
Same, I was happy to see all the cool t shirt merch but honestly just being able to see this art made me more hype than everything else.,645
truly a match made in heaven,304
😖bro im gonna cry its so happy...,82
They're all so cute,58
It hurts... but on the plus side, we now have an OMOCAT-endorsed >!”Mari lives” au.!<,713
I bought the Mari one, I didn't know how quickly it would sell out but the full shirt spread caught my eye lol,179
I personally went for Mari's and Sunny's.,14
Ah, yes, the denial AU,445
My headcanon is that Sunny makes the OMORI game himself after becoming a gamedev,163
Stage one:,22
i had an experience like this, ate some bad fish and got a fever dream flashback to (crappy) russian childhood,6
Not canonically.,129
I got the pink neighbor’s room shirt since they restocked it and it sold out like 5 minutes after,80
All of us have lmao,30
i got the kel shirt! honestly i’m very happy w the purchase, it’s bright and yellow and cute, right up my alley!,40
>!Also Mari. This picture seems to be a "what if accident never happened" scenario. Fate of Mewo in actual story remains ambiguous.!<,112
"Sunny why are you doing this to me.",15
the one constant in the timelines is >!sunny loses his eye!<,58
But look at basil too, it seems like it's a representation of him "sharing" the pain with omori.,18
B F F S,21
Where do I buy one for my own!,4
i wish i had my own money because i so want that chibi kel shirt!!!!,3
What's bothering me tho is that Mari's hair doesn't look purple but at the same time it does-,33
MFKDKD WAIT-,5
Asking the real questions,18
Big reverse mirror,15
I admire your BatBall agenda,37
I ship everyone with each other In this game but I’m honestly surprised kel/Aubrey ship is so underrated, I always thought their childhood dynamic was cute, I loved how they were always seeming to get on each other’s nerves. They just go well together too.,29
That'd be nice but it seems like Kel is the type to not be interested in anyone in his friend group,14
“This Totally represents how while the boys mainly kept their inner demons/(the demon thing that omori has in the mirror) secret from eachother and never fully admit it but Mari and Aubrey say their issues upfront in front of everyone so they don’t have any inner demons”. . This is the Totally canon reason why guys,29
This is the best art for my shipping heart. Kel embarrassing Aubrey is the best,30
KELBREY NATION RISE,18
I'm in my happy space. I've never been here as long as I can remember.,6
I would have been happy with just some fanart of them. I didn't think we'd get official art! Though maybe [this small one counts too.](),4
“Roselily” THIS NAME WARMS MY HEART-,5
That one fucked up show,5
She's holding hero hand so it's not a ghost,4
THE OMORI SUBREDDIT became FURIOUS!. . THE OMORI SUBREDDIT used BANISH!. . THE OMORI SUBREDDIT dragged you into Downvote Space!. . Did 9999 damage!,29
It ain’t a fandom without the edge lords,20
cringe, you should be dead,13
you guys are way too attached to a fictional character,2
i originally thought this community was really wholesome and welcoming but now i just know that anyone that doesnt join the hivemind gets told to die,-16
When i first saw this art i was like "Damn this is beautiful." I am currently deciding if i should have it as my Computer Wallpaper or not,39
One of them is already in heaven, but I guess you could say they descended the stairs to ascend the stairs.,218
It hurts and I love it,203
The fools, they’ve made this one canon.,174
\>> add a spoiler tag yo.,56
Just like Sunny and Basil caught Mari's eye,95
Same,22
Coping comes in many shapes and sizes,200
Does that mean Sunny is OMOCAT (or at least one of the people behind it)?,83
Idk what this comment means but I'm taking it as a threat. Square up 🤜🤛😎,13
yeah but m a r i,108
Saame,accidentally ordered the wrong size tho but hopefully they can fix it,27
Same, I signed up for a notification via email for when they restocked that shirt and got notified before they opened the shop, first thing I snagged.,15
Same! And my friends call me identical to kel. I’m just worried that people are gonna call it girly because it says BFF and has hearts on it. I love it so much though,27
stop it with your facts and logic :(,27
>!I only just noticed that Mewo seemed to still live with Sunny in the original trailer. Part of me just wants to hope that she's living with one of his parents during the game, but it's probably too wishful a scenario.!<,23
I’d buy that shirt lol,11
I thought it said ffs lmfao,3
On OMOCAT's website I already preordered one cuz it's the best shirt I've seen in my life,7
Maybe someone will buy it for you for birthday or christmas :],5
Is she a dream? Is she not? Who knows!!!,7
idk if an event happens where hes separated from aubrey, he might realize how much he cares about her. sometimes constant banter can lead to closer relationships cause youre interacting with a person way more.,10
That's what it's like as the token bro of the group. Everyone around you hooks up, and you and your hidden feelings are left to rot as you continue to play the objective wingman and buddy.,8
I know its joke and all, but  I feel like I need to clarify that it bothers me purely aestheticaly.. . Also technicaly we can go even further - Aubrey also has her eyes obscured by contacts, so we can say that her unobscured eyes depict that only Mari >!was spared the trauma since she ded and all!<, and then dig even deeper til we get to Australia.,17
Hello Shakespeare...(bot),2
and it aint a fandom without a toxic hivemind that attacks anyone that doesnt go with whatever ideology has been set up,-11
~~I mean saying “cringe Mari should be dead” isn’t really wholesome when the alive option is much more wholesome~~,25
Bro, they are just downvotes, chill lol,8
“I thought this community was really wholesome”. . “cringe, mari should be dead”,6
Thing is, your comment looked quite rude and many people disagreed so they downvoted you. . And the person who said that was imitating what you said, while if they were actually saying what they thought it would surely have been worrying-. . But still, that’d be one person, not the whole fandom, so why’d you make it that?-,3
“Man this place isn’t welcoming saying it’s cringe that a beloved character isn’t desd”,3
This can escalate real quick,63
Omg,15
No fuck you,9
🥲,32
More like Basil caught Sunny's eye,6
Denial?,32
Yeah it would. . And the 6 year delay would be because of Sunny having to face those memories again and the guilt coming back partially,80
I meant the first stage of grief lmao,16
but Kel is there so it's cannon,54
aw who cares about what they think, it’s such a nice shirt i say go for it!,38
Bro, you do what makes you happy! Screw what other people think! I'm sure it will look great on you.,10
kel would want you to have it lets be real and his opinion is the only one that matters,8
I wish I could stop inflicting myself on me too...,11
Wait they really have kel’s shirt for sale!?,5
That’s fair, I think there were a few events but I guess it’s just me personally because I didn’t really sense the attraction between them? It’s cute tho don’t get me wrong I just didn’t see it,5
Honestly I only said it was a joke since I was worried people would say I overthought everything, I actually do kinda believe my theory,10
>!but, he meant as a cannon poster, mari is literally dead in the story!<,4
just being canon 😎😎😎😎,-6
he meant that it would be better if the art was about the cannon ending,1
In this case its descalating,62
😑,10
My headcanon is that all the events of the game actually happened exactly as they were written, and now we're all very very sad and trying to cope with memes and barely viable AUs,72
Ya know what you’re right. If it will make me happy I should just do it. Thanks for the inspiration ^^,18
Y E S,5
No need to be worried. Overthinking beyond the realm of reason is what psychological horror fans do, as long as it all in good fun there is no shame in it. Thats what these communities are for.,7
Canon isn't the ultimate truth dude, AU's are popular for a reason, and fanfiction. . Death of the author and all that. . Though here the author is breaking their own canon,11
Still tho, + I believe he added a comma in his comment so it made that theory more plausible, but still, the original comment being “cringe Mari should be dead” would more come off as my understanding of it more tbh,2
STOOOOOOP,43
The one true headcanon,27
yay i'm so glad!!,14
LINK IT PLEASE,4
Yeah! Thanks for that!,3
There’s a reason why headcanons exist, canon is a term **ONLY** used to describe a part of a franchise that the original writer wrote/made, not what is the truth,4
>Death of the author and all that. . that is not what death of the author means . . > Canon isn't the ultimate truth dude, AU's are popular for a reason, and fanfiction . . i actually really agree with that, fiction is fiction to begin with so you can shape a story however you like, it is your to enjoy anyways,4
I'm sure that's what Sunny heard while Mari fell down the stairs,14
[deleted],1
,7
i always thought that was what death of the author meant, never actually looked it up though, my bad,3
Suddenly Danganronpa.,1
dont worry, i also thought it meant like that the first time i heard about it,2
Basil.. (Please upvote),1154
The same is when:. . Human feels depression in a rpg.. Brain:. "Hey thats very well written, i am sad". . Motor sense ------> goes to put game in favorite on steam,218
I'd add "depression" slightly away from the effector,118
wow, thats basil from omori,72
Thats BASIL from Omori,32
ha there is no way this is corr- wait fuck I upvoted,29
Okay but I’m trying to think of a character from omori that I WOULDNT upvote. I love them all,34

This fandom chock full of talented artists. Absolutely incredible >!Nice attention to detail with the something coming from under the floor!<,740
I just love how you’ve captured all their personalities and expressions do perfect!! Aubrey is so happy to plant egg sweethearts face, kel so bright and loud, hero nervous trying to keep the team healthy, and omori questioning reality lmao,417
The art is so good and the concept is so good but what absolutely does it for me is the massive concern on Hero’s face as he’s making fucking eggs of all things to keep everyone alive.. . and the best part is that’s how you actually play the game. . . Also I just noticed how Sweetheart kinda looks like a donut in this shot,212
This should’ve been the last painting to unlock, this is great! Amazing work OP,94
words can't describe how good this is op.. i can feel the chaos and hear world end's valentine just from looking at this. looks like its time for a new wallpaper. . &#x200B;. . (don't think i didn't notice the tiny eye below the stage lol. nice detail),175
this is an actual masterpiece,42
AWESOME!!!. . EVERYTHING ABOUT IT!!,28
thank you for the new background,19
Outstanding work. You've managed to capture everything I love about this battle. 10/10,14
Don't assume I don't see SOMETHING vibin underneath the floorboards!,17
I think this is my favorite piece of OMORI art that I've ever seen. Just look at this!!!! It's so good!!!!,13
i absolutely love the concept of hero frantically trying to cook eggs for his friends while a raging battle is on-going,10
do you hav e any social media? id love to see more of ur work,10
she corcle,9
Maaan yes. this is very accurate!!! 🤣,8
This is the first time I post on Reddit and I'm really happy you all liked the drawing so much ahahah thank you so much for the comments and the awards! What a great game this is :),5
I had an idea for something similar! Amazing artwork.,7
the textures are *chefs kiss* truly captured the essence of omori's beautiful artstyle,5
Rosa screaming at the top of her lungs,3
This is so fucking amazing. I mean, even something's down there,3
This is incredible!!,3
that's awesome man,3
Please do one for ABBI!,3
I'm just surprised how well you captured the art style. It's really an unusual one and to even nail such unusual style is insane. Nice work!,3
Wow, this is just.. Amazing! What program did you make this in?,3
Seeing Hero trying to dish out as many eggs as possible reminds me of the first time I went into the fight. Underleveled af and literally just prayed Hero could tank and heal everything to win. Took way longer than I should have.,3
This battle makes me rage,2
I don’t know who you people are, how are you in popular with only 700 upvotes?,2
Wish this game would hurry up and come to Switch, haha.,2
Sweetheart's dress looking like a huge donut!,2
This is incredible,2
Yessssssssssss,2
omg this is so pretty! the colors, the composition and details, and just the texture in everything AAAAAAA. . (also.. could i ask what your brush settings are?),2
Omg! This is so well drawn 🤣🤣,2
this is so amazing. definitely my favourite fan art of omori so far,2
the music for this fight was so good i cried.. . &#x200B;. . not sad tears. . &#x200B;. . but tears of pure energetic emotional overload,2
Absolutely gorgeus, love it so much,2
this is awesome!!,2
unreal! SO good,2
THIS IS INCREDIBLE. . I like how you used the body pillow for aubrey ~~but not the teapot for hero cause its kinda useless~~,2
the energy in this picture is immaculate I love it,2
I like how kel's mouth is half of his face,2
10/10 chef's kiss. Couldn't be better,2
You matched the artstyle well,2
W O W.,2
I love it so much!!! you really captured so much energy and action into this scene. I love your art!,2
This battle was the first one where I was able to actually utilize emotions and skills properly cause I was so over-leveled before,2
Wow.. This art is really fantastic! Everything just looks really good! Especially Hero lol. Thank you for gracing us with this wonderful piece!,2
I love how stupid and funny her ending was, I can't even feel sorry, that was just funny,4
kel is a skinwalker,1
This is amazing,1
Mmm... There’s something on the floor,1
I love the detail with SOMETHING in the breach on the floor,1
this is so well done, really captures the feeling in that battle,1
The fact that hero is just frantically cooking while in a battle-,1
Kel's face is amazing beyond description. If the game had some sort of ultimate emotion in it, *that* would be what it looked like.,1
hoyl shit aubrey girlboss,1
This made me think of hero frantically making food while the small platform crumbles beneath them and a gigantic swole planet stands before them,1
Seriously this art is something else.,1
This is both hilarious and awesome.,1
Who noticed SOMETHING in the floor,1
Oh God the floor,1
bruh,1
the most annoying battle with the best boss music in the game,1
,1
Best battle and best battle music,1
I love how kel is just like “WELCOME TO THE CHANNEL! Today we are gonna throw a coconut at this random person!”,1
,1
This is the best art I've seen so far, fits perfectly with the  . Omori style,1
Amazing,1
This art is Perfect.,1
I CANT BEAT HER SOMEONE HELP,1
the only thing that bothers me is that omori has light in his eyes . . other than that masterpiece,1
Sweetheart is the reason I put down the game for 6 months.,1
 (Aubrey is counter spamming again dam it COOK FASTER) oh hey omori you want a snack?. .  U gud bro,1
there be a friend in the floorboards,1
omg this is so gud,1
"Hero why are you making eggs?",1
Thank you! And yes, I have seen seriously amazing fanart for this game so far, I'm impressed,221
Aubrey actually has the body pillow that you find before this fight, i love the detail in this.,248
YEESSS. 😆 Savage.,30
Exactly, Hero and his worried cooking was the main focus I structured the drawing around :) (I'll have to say Sweetheart's donut shape was a coincidence, but appropriate hahaha),60
Ahahaha can't compare myself with the great Rococo. Thank you!,35
Ehehe I was going for the chaos while drawing this, thank you!,43
Except hero is cooking eggs instead of making cookies,2
Thank you! And yes, mainly kaydakayart on twitter and kaydakay on insta.,4
Thank you!! :D. Well, honestly I use an amalgamation of brushes fellow students have shared at my school and free texture ones I've been downloading and mixing through the years, honestly I'm a mess with my brush library so I'm sorry I can't give you a proper answer hahah (just lots of pencil and charcoal texture!),2
Kel also has the coconut,131
I mean Eggs do taste delicious,1
And Hero has got the pan,106
And Omori has the knife.   Well, not that anyone was expecting otherwise.,86
And something just looking at the squad from under the ground,25
And this is all Cherry on the Top. Absolutely wonderful,3

WHY DOES THIS WORK So WELL,229

Sand is yummy,27

Legends have pet rocks,19
Kel is there, we know what that means lmao,15
Remember everyone, all Kel memes are canon!,16
Gods acknowledge the fact that they're unloved and wallow in their self hatred and guilt for an eternally long time, totally not speaking from experience here. . &#x200B;. . oh fuck wrontg sub,27
gods have flowers,10
Gods don't even make it into the meme because they're too busy taking good care of their garden,8

I ate sand when I was little so i was legend?,1
legends DO eat sand you are right,1
Anything Kel does is Canon.,1
Hell yeah, be a legend everyone,1
Eat sand become legend... unless you're reading this then if you can read you'll probably get sick from it.,1
I wanna pick it off my toes and eat it!,1
Kel may not have bitches, BUT HE BALLIN,1
you know what they say, every kel meme is canon,1
Well I guess it’s sand time,1

When the comic artist denies the holocaust 😳,123
rockthrow is a deplorable fascist,58
He is, which is why the meme format is so great, because the original Amogus edit takes his comic and distorts it so viscerally that it’s practically making fun of him and the comic,33
Wtf, developer of amongus is a nazi?. . . . . Edit: nevermind, the article was about the stonetoss. I almost thought aolngus devepers wee nazis...,-15

Poor Asgore. . I mean CHICKEN NUGGET,8
Pebblethrow kinda sus ngl 😳,32
He never did ?,0
It kinda backfired though, if you check his Twitter he's thriving from all the memes and popularity. He actually posts some of them on his Twitter or re-memes them and has gained even more followers. People like him thrive in this kind of environment, Ive actually discovered him because of the memes making fun of him and he still gets thousands of likes and RT's. Like I'll be the first to say it though, memeing him hasn't worked 💀,34
I suppose I see where you’re coming from, like I said this edit is really REALLY well done, it’s just kind of a shame so many people see it but don’t actually know it’s origins. Plus as u/ZangyNuggets mentioned, he tends to thrive on the whole “edgelord” persona and the distortion of his works usually gain him more popularity, he makes memes saying he thrives off of it, etc.,6
I think this guy said this because no one was saying that he was good, this format just makes fun of him, either way.,9
Chad,1
nice alt account, stonetoss.  where’d you get it, the nazi store?,5
amogus amogus amoung,28
Bad publicity is still publicity to cesspools like stonetoss. He thrives on this kind of attention and if anything it’s made him more known. . . For every 100 people who are joking there’s going to be 1 or so people who actually get sucked in to his antisemetic bullshit.,6
. . I know literally doing one quick google search is too hard for pebblethrow fans, but here you go sport.,1

He’s mocking the deniers you dimwit,-1
He's literally encouraging denying the holocaust you half baked wheat biscuit,18
More people have probably become Holocaust deniers because of this smear campaign than his actual comics making fun of the deniers,-1

Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.. . &nbsp;. . What kind of rocks are never under water?. . Dry ones!,10

I'd rather stab myself than hurt the cat,1
>!AYO THE PIZZAS HERE!<,119
>!That scene was the one time my compulsive need to check every possibility paid off, and I found the stab option before I cut mewo!<,151
Somewhere out in Whitespace is a mirror,24
She does not know what is happening,26
Wait why did no one else think of that,3
you can open the menu and stab yourself instead of the cat. thats what i did,81
im v late but i literally got so anxious that i looked up if i HAD to do to bc i was so nauseous about it fiskskdkdj,13

>!The game really said "suicide is the only option!<,112
#FUCK THAT WAS OPTIONAL!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?,27
stop, ir really hurt,3
>!I didn’t notice that was an option at first, but even if I did I probably would’ve still cut mewo open just to see what would happen. In either case the game truly wins, because either you make yourself kill yourself thinking it’s the best option, or you cut open your cat for absolutely nothing, and you kill yourself afterwards knowing it’s the only option!<,88
That fact made the level of upset I had felt during that moment exponentially greater.,45
I did notice that option, but I assumed it would wake me up and lead me to the bad ending because I didn't finish reconciling with my past, so I cut her open instead. God that make me feel sick. One of the best moments in the game, absolutely horrid. My rage when the butler only told me what to do *after* I cut her open...,16
/late, but I just finished the game and I'm not proud to admit I actually had to look up if >!cutting up Mewo was necessary (thank God it wasn't). Animal abuse is one of my big triggers and I genuinely got *this* close to breaking down in that scene.!<,8
Late gang!,6
I got used to animal gore, human gore but I ain't used to seeing Barney get gored,1

yep. open the menu and you can stab yourselg instead of the cat before you kill the cat.,14

Jeez how horrific... I'm going to try cutting the cat now that I know I can,1
When one of my friends played the game and he had to do it, He bawled his eyes for hours and told me that it made him feel more empathetic to Suicidal people, it also changed his attitude to be a more kinder once. . This game can change people fr.,15
I hate how Omori leaves you wondering what you are supposed to do all the time and also you can’t see anything on screen during the horror bits because it’s too dark,7
its neat that something so distant from actual reality can make us feel so strongly, i heard a while ago that our brains cant distinguish from fiction characters and real ppl i wonder if thats true,11

No. You're supposed to breathe and age and die of starvation and thirst what the heck you guys got the wrong ending,3
FUCK I THOUGHG THAT WOULD RUIN THE ENDING SO I DIDNT DO IT,8
I actually didn't feel very much from the game if I'm being honest. I'd already had the big twist spoiled for me but I think the main thing is that the atmosphere wasn't right for me to be playing a game like that when I was, I reckon if I'd only played it alone at night it would have affected me more,3
It changed me for the better it made my overall athletic physique improve and I shadow box ghosts,2

Aubyinium Plasma is made in a MAX Voltage Advanced Fusion Reactor in order to turn it. Into Aubyinium Fluid. . You need to put it in a Vacuum freezer at Voltage. . After that mix it in with liquid oxygen and Hydrochloric Acid to get Aubychloric Hydroxide (it still a acid) . . once your done you chemical dehydrate it at a UXV chemical dehydrator. to get Aubyinium Fine Powder (Chlorine, Hydrogen, and Oxygen returns to being a gas). . After that you can either mix in Gold, Platinum, and Indium to make a Superconductor called MariTech SuperConducter for Maritech circuits or you can put it in a EBF with Infinity coils to finnaly get Aubyinium Ingot,1

Hmph. You found me.,1
Kel is sad because he's gonna save everyone's ass by throwing snacks instead of basketball. . he doesn't have luxury of using skills, only whole pizzas and roasted chickens, sometimes jam (packet),670
So we're talking about how we use Kel in our playthroughs?  . . . Kel's the juice man, he brings the juice. I mostly throw juice at Omori since he expends so much juice, and the other two don't need to worry about it, or have so much of it to use with a moveset that combines both low cost and high cost abilities that they usually don't expend it as fast.. . If I'm not using Juice me/Rally, I'm using Kel for his followups (making Omori ecstatic/AOE followup with Hero), or Rebound (coupled with Aubrey's windup since it does less damage the  more enemies it has.)  . . . I almost never use items, but when I do, it's either everyone, or someone that could've spent their turn doing damage, as I don't mind wasting that turn if it means my party is going to be better healed/juiced for the next turn.,147
how do you draw hair better than me,88
Poor Kel :(,58
Omg I'm dying inside!. . Poor Kel,42
Alright hear me out.. Kel is for annoy towards enemies and emergency snacks. Aubry is for team spirit and counter. Omori is for big damage. Hero guards until we need something that the other 3 can't do,39
He lost his rock and he doesn’t get a seat...,27
I’m ashamed to say that I utilized kel more than hero..,22
I just saw someone drew Kel holding Pluto’s “third leg”...and I want to bleach my eyes.,11
This is painfully funny, soz Kel,7
i dont know why people think Kel is useless in battle, like ????? damn, that follow-up with hero that hits all of the enemies is useful as hell when fighting more than one enemy, like in those fights with U.F.Os! hits all of them at once, kill them all and doesn't spend any juice? count me in! and with grinding as well! In my playthrough I barely used juice or snacks, just using a good strategy with Kel. Kel is definitely the most useful to me.,5
Kel is sad because 1.0 kel was trash,4
Hang in there kel!,4
That day i lost my friend...,2
Someone save the poor boy we know and love as Kel.,1
Kel for me was just to make Omori furious and throw snacks and juice at everyone.,1
We truely live in a society,1
EPIC!,1
For me, Kel’s the big damage dealer. He deals damage and he’s damn good at it. He’s also who I usually have use items because he’s faster than everyone else.,1
why couldnt it be omor? why kel??? kel did not deserve to have to fly in that way,1
Legit chuckled,1
[removed],195
Haha flex austhestic chicken ball kel run n' gun go 9000 DMG brrr,28
Kel has so much stamina, I always use either his ricochet or annoying skill, it pairs so well with omori's mock!!,9
I use Kel so much for so many things wtf,2
I went to orange oasis early and ended up getting over powered by fighting the enemies in the Dino Dig area, so the kids were all little murder machines with way too much Juice and Health, meaning I could go longer without restoring them. Kel was mostly used to make the whole party angry while Omori made the bosses sad, and then I would spam multi-hit attacks with Kel, Aubrey and Omori while Hero was the juice boi when necessary.,34
I mostly use Kel as a single target damage dealer or an emergency healer. ehem ehem ecstatic + run n' gun ehem ehem,15
Bro that's deep 😔,14
See, Hero is the healer but Kel is FASTER. So if I want to heal Aubrey before she can get turned into toast I have to patch her up before the boss moves and Hero is slower than a tortoise that’s just eaten your entire birthday cake. Solution? Kel throwing EVERYTHING you’ve got at his friends.,249
Same, I used Hero as a support since a lot of his skills are healing related. Not to mention most of his equipment pieces increase his juice,49
I usually just use hero if I know none of my team is in danger of dying in that turn before he can act, but if the health is like below 2/3 and I’m fighting a strong foe I’m gonna have kel throw a whole pizza at everyone cause he’s the fastest. This was very few and far between though cause kel quickly became a huge damage dealer for me when his follow up moves leveled up and I needed his “pass to hero” in order to take care of multiple enemies at once. If I needed someone to heal the party that’s not hero I’d usually use Aubrey due to her being built like a brick wall (especially with a high defense charm), but even that was rare since I needed her power hit to take out sad foes (or just enemies with insane defense) and her mood wrecker to take down happy foes (was literally the biggest contributor to the sweetheart fight),3
Nah hero has Fast Food which makes him heal before anyone else's turn. I just spam rebound with kel pretty effective,31
I guess it's just the difference between using Ralsei and using actual food items.,5
Hero is the healer so i have him rabbits foot 🗿,1
Omori is the healer, Aubrey is emotional support/damage dealer, hero and kel are constantly attacking duh...,1
True, but fast food doesn’t heal multiple or heal up to full every time. Using Kel for his speed tends to be situational.,12
For that you can use Snack Time. I use it early, so if someone will be hurt, will be healed. I use Kel for healing only if things are going bad and if someone needs Juice.,6

Red determination = Omori/Sunny: >!Omori will not succumb!!! But Sunny doesn't quit when prompted to give up either in the true route.!<. . Green Kindness = Hero: >!Hero is super nice in the story. He wants to be there for his friends which is why it's all the more shocking when he lashes out at Kel. Still, that's not enough to change who I believe he is.!<. . Orange Bravery = Kel: >!Athletic and confronting your friend or trying to contact them and get them out of their isolation is something to be commended.!<. . Blue Integrity = Mari: >!She wants sunny to move forward and is even honest about her flaws when the dream world isn't. Admitting she pushed sunny too hard shows some form of integrity.!<. . Light Blue Patience = Basil:>!For better or for worse he waited 4 years for sunny to confront the truth. Plus in the dreamworld admits to not being a good fighter and patience in undertale is the first to die so sorry Basil.!<. . Yellow Justice = Aubrey: >!Or what she believes is justice. She lashes out at her friends because she believes they have wronged her in some way when all of them were coping with Mari's death in different ways.!<. . Purple Perseverance = Something:>!It still wants sunny to be better and will continue to follow him until he either cedes his identity, Accepts Mari's death, or dies.!<,400
Sunny/Omori - Determination  . Basil - Preservance  . Mari - Integrity  . Hero - Kindness  . Aubrey - Bravery  . Kel - Uhh... Justice?,38
I am sorry you see what now?,54
No kel is with papyrus hero is with sans,43
Kel with Papyrus. Hero with Mettaton, especially headspace Hero but headspace Hero is based on Real Hero so it works,2
How do we know he isn’t just gonna try to rip the poor flower boy’s soul out like what he did to the last human that came along,24
If you do I would love to see it!,14
Just got one from a free box thingy, REEEE no more! Lol. . (I was gonna give it anyway, but found this and just HAD to make a dumb reply),6
Polly said his parents hired her to watch him since they're always away if I recall.,75

He is from OMORI,5
Basil as Asgore's Child real??????,61
but he don't have flowee tho,129
Ah, yes. The guy who shoved not one, but thousands of his family into certain death.,38
\*void sounds\*,18
into the abyss you go,14
I know this Is one year old but ,6
on my end it showed it as working in the comment section but not in the messages so I wasn't sure. . thank you for letting me know,28
Purple should be OMORI. . Determined to the end to keep the truth repressed, knowing no limits and even threatening to kill Sunny when he obstructs that goal,172
(idk how to mark spoilers) Aubrey being justice one reminds me of the Undertale fandom's soul rules where all souls can lose their trait if they act against it except for justice, for justice is a very personal choice; so long as the holder believes they're doing the right thing, it holds.,43
very accurate in my opinion.,3
I always thought it would be:. .  Perseverance. .  Kindness. .  Integrity. .  Patience. .  Bravery,7
why tho? i can see kel with sans bcuz the both funy and hero and papyrus because they both like cooking,35
maybe after they escape the underground,30
I’m assuming this is after they escaped the underground.,17
He empathizes too much with the child, Asgore can’t bring himself to turn him into a Basil-kebab.,9
!!!!!,11
Thank you.,2
Does white lady count? And if not then he probably had a delicate flower with it’s void characteristics,119
Hey he can get some from the very very very rare flowers that the grey mourner has just make sure not to stub your toe,11
*millions,22
PROFILE PICTURE BROTHER,4
>Determined. . Hence why he’s Determination, along with Sunny.,56
To make a spoiler do !< to the right of the thing you’re trying to spoiler and >! to the left of it, don’t put spaces in between them and the word,9
I mean Patience does kinda fit Basil but i don't think Perseverance fits Sunny, he seems more determined like.,3
I think sans is too laid back for kel. Kel and papyrus both have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. Hero and sans are both laid back.,40
White Lady is a tree so... Yeah I think it counts,78
Seeing how deep and large that pit is, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was billions.,18
Frisk/chara = Sunny/OMORI,5
Sunny has Persevered through alot. He's not really determined, he just perseveres through hardship.,2
plus hero and sans both makes puns you forget this,40
Plus his castle is filled with vines, bushes, thorns and chainsaws. I'm sure Basil and Asgore would like to garden with him at times, but run away once he decides to prune his plants.,41
Oh my gosh. Sans is hero?,25
But that's just a theory,17
The photo in sans's basement proves it,7
a game theory,4
Basil, tying the bedsheets into a rope: Ah shit, here we go again...,2322
OMORI: deleted scene,793
I just realized nobody linked the original art. . [,712
I feel bad for laughing but this is genuinely hilarious,656
[deleted],564
meanwhile at the secret hideout: aubrey tagged you(basil),358
I'll be frank,I wouldn't blame Hero for doing this.. The realization that Sunny and Basil is the catalyst of his current depression and woes would not be an easy pill to swallow even in the best case scenario.,702
besides being hilarious, just wanted to call out how perfectly you replicated the art style of those photos haha.  if this was an easter egg in the game, I would believe it,218
I have an idea of how the battle would go:. . Sunny encounters hero.. . Sunny uses calm down. . Hero becomes furious.. . Hero throws sunny down a flight of stairs. 500 damage, game over.,177
I get that this is just a joke (and a good one lol), but taking this seriously, I don’t buy it. Not only was it an accident and hero would sympathize with his guilt, but in the scene backstage, he was the one saying “just because you did something bad, you’re not a bad person”. Granted, that’s part of Sunny’s dream, but I feel those quotes are meant to reflect their actual perspectives.,125
This is golden,106
I’m dying and so is Sunny,106
God this is absolute gold i love it . . I don't see this scene playing out any other way,93
this is it, true ending,66
I wish they showed us what happened after the revation. I expected it in the moment I learned that truth and I knew that the shit would hit them really, really hard. sad that it wasn't showed.,60
This is amazing, lmao. I don’t think Hero would take it this badly but this is the best depiction of this outcome I’ve seen,48
I know this is a joke and I laughed but also a after thinking about it a lot, based on my interpretation of the characters, I actually think that Hero would initially be the kindest to Sunny. Lemme explain: . . Kel would be the most understanding and quick to forgive and have faith and believe that Sunny is a good person and it was an accident. He would probably initially be in the shock though and not know what to do and need a bit of time to process. . . Aubrey might storm off in rage and tears, but eventually come to understand it was a tragic accident. She may never forgive Sunny or talk to him again but she would understand it was an accident. Maybe with a lot of pushing from Kel she may eventually come around to trying to slowly forgive him. But it would certainly never be the same. . . Finally Hero. I truly don’t think he’d be as angry as so many people seem to think. I think he would initially be in complete shock and bewilderment, and his first instinct would be to comfort Sunny while his mind is spinning from the info. But afterwards, as much as he tries to be understanding, I think he’d definitely have a growing resentment. But as others have said, at the same time it’s almost like a weight lifted - to know her death was an accident and that he didn’t fail her by not seeing the signs. I think he’d try to continue a strained friendship, probably mostly encouraged by Kel . . That’s just my opinion tho~ if anyone wants to discuss I’d be happy to,40
I love this way more than I should.,36
This is honestly probably how it would turn out unless Sunny made a really good speech about what he’d done that’s moving enough for them to at least not try to murder him,40
This is the best post on the sub and 100% believable in game.,36
Leaked after ending,28
Welp, Hero is going to the prison.. . He's an adult and he clearly has a reason/motive to look at this as a murder and not manslaughter.,59
OMG LMAO,23
BRO NOOO,20
I honestly hope there will be some update that hints at a kinder epilogue for everyone.. . Not even being on speaking terms, just... not joining in the murder konga.,17
I GOT SO SCARED I THOUGH HERO ACTUALLY SNAPPED Thank god it's just fanart,15
Basil: "What happened here?". . Hero: "Well you see, Sunny just committed suicide.",14
i regret this lmao,10
the look on his face, oh my god... i want to hit myself for snickering,10
Basil glad he bedridden orelse this is going to be WWE matches,8
It's sad that I can see this potentially happening and is just completely up to each individual headcanon since.  You know.  Open ended ending. . I still struggle to view how hero would react because he was the one closest to mari.. Aubrey may have had anger issues,  but her character arc and actions has me believe she'll be on the forgiving side. Emotionally troubled. But indubitably forgiving. Kel is Kel. He a bro.,9
HAHAHA NOOOOO,9
"Lets see how you like it",7
Stairway to heaven.,8
HAHAHAHAHAHA,6
hc hero rlly would tag sunny after the game  😔  😔,4
lol,6
Omg,5
Aubrey comin in hot for revenge though-,5
Hell I think the stairs are gonna be hurting more than Sunny by the time Hero gets done with him.,5
Hey, isn't this u|duplicarto 's art?,4
At least there wasn't anything sharp at the bottom.,5
At least we know that this didn't happen since watering Basil's flowers gets is an extra ending cutscene with sunny and Basil the only two people in the room. Meaning the others probably left.,4
14,4
I’m going to hell for laughing at this.,4
bruuuh why is there almost no art of sunnys friends reacting to the truth its what i came to the sub for 😔,4
Ah shit, grab the noose.,4
A family trait, it seems 🤔. . >! That being thrown down the stairs!<,4
OH NO!!!,3
This is sad,3
bro I just want to see how they react 😔,3
I've been laughing for the past 2 minutes because of this,3
A fair response,3
Close,3
I'm gonna go to hell,2
This could be a meme format,2
LMFAOOAOA I CANT I CANT,2
that made me laugh so hard,2
WHOA, Why did you have to hurt me this way I'm going to hell for laughing.,2
Holy shit. I'm wheezing.,2
I feel bad for laughing at this,2
I love and hate this fandom. Not for the meme, no that's cool but **the comments**. They're whole paragraphs and there's so much of people analyzing everything and I feel so overwhelmed. So apparently this is the fandom that analyzes everything and theorizes everything. and that's why I love and hate this fandom.,2
i legit wheezed at this,2
Basil would probably attempt to kill hero outright for this,2
oh so THATS where that came from,2
I'm going to hell for laughing at this right after finishing the game, but  hey, it was very tense.,2
Hahaha, oh now I made myself sad,2
You'd think he found out Sunny killed Mari but it's actually because he found a spider in Sunny's shoulder,2
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES,2
Don’t worry Sunny was fine, he only suffered major spinal fractures after hero was done throwing him down the stairs.,2
>!You tagged yourself off of a balcony.!<,1
I came here because I just finished the game and needed some Fandom fluffing, WHY AM I LAUGHING SO HARD.,1
,1
IL this is really old but....  .  .  . .  .  .  . Love how Aubrey still tried to stop Hero, and Kel just "Oh no" face,1
This is like the 70 th time this image has been posted bro,1
Honestly , this is canon to me, in my perspective neither Sunny nor Basil deserves redemption/peace of mind, how messed up you have to be to do something like that to someone you suppose to love?,0
AHAHAHAH karma,1
Sunny: I sooooooooooooooooooooorry!...,1
is this an actual ending or is this a fanon one,1
a reaction like HOW DARE YOU PUSH MY BELOVED DOWNSTAIRS YOU FREAKING BRAT is not something heroish guys ,1
Its Canon. And you cant make me believe otherwise,1
When I saw the true ending i just said:. . None of them is gonna forgive him.,1
I swear on my fucking life I can't remember any time in the last 4 year where I laugh harder than with this picture,1
That's now part of his instinct,>! staging suicides.!<,1363
GODDAMMIT, I shouldn’t have laughed at that,205
They'll all get a turn eventually .\.,46
No, I swear that didn’t just make me laugh…. . >!lmao!<,43
Capeless hero,56
Same,69
I think between the three, only Hero may not come around to forgiving, or at least accepting Sunny. Kel is Kel, Aubrey would probably be left feeling bewildered, confused, and angry, but she had also nearly killed Basil in frustration and anger, and I think that experience would be a catalyst for her to forgive Sunny. Hero on the other hand, it can spiral out in so many different ways, and I don't see any room for improvement of either Hero's or Sunny's conditions.,757
It may be just me, but I feel like whether or not Sunny's friends choose to forgive him is not the point of the ending. It's a little misleading because up until that point, the game is framed as reconnecting with your old friends, but I feel like the last portion of the game is all about forgiving yourself and overcoming your own guilt - admitting the truth, coming clean to those around you, is the first step in healing from the trauma that Sunny went through after Mari's death. I don't think his friends would forgive him personally - it's not the most positive ending - but it's hopeful. Sunny can finally begin healing and overcoming.,217
God I agree. What kills me is that this game was already so good on the premise that you’re trying to overcome depression and move on with living in the wake of your older sibling committing suicide. It was relatable. It would have still been traumatic, especially because loved ones often blame themselves when suicide occurs. This game was great, and then it *had to do a twist*. Suddenly I don’t relate to this kid. I understand the accident, but I sure as shit don’t understand why the sudden step to staging a hanging. Like Jesus Christ. This game was great. It didn’t need the twist. At all. IMO the twist basically ruins the game for me.,49
I think they would for several reasons.. . 1. It was just an accident, Sunny never meant to kill Mari. They all know how much Sunny loved Mari.. 2. He and Basil were only like 12, didn't know any better and was afraid of punishments.. 3. Hero said something like "this time we'll be here for each other when we need it".. 4. They know how much suffering Sunny has been through already, locking himself away for 4 years.. 5. Aubrey almost killed Basil.. 6. Hero might be relieved that Mari didn't commit suicide after all. 7. It's been 4 years. They've all had time to heal and mature. Hero is far more mature in the first place.. 8. Knowing what really happened doesn't change the fact that she died.. 9. It takes alot of courage for Sunny to admit something like that.. . Or maybe I'm just incredibly high on Copium.,14
I feel Aubrey would, if only because she nearly killed Basil on accident in a nearly identical way, and I feel Kel would, because he’s just too innocent and kind to hold it against Sunny for long.. . I think Hero would try to be compassionate, and would try to forgive Sunny for what he did, but I don’t think he could ever fully forgive him, because for the longest time, HERO thought he drove Mari to suicide, and struggled with that fact. Hearing that it was Sunny who killed her, and Basil who staged the Hanging, I don’t think he could ever forgive either of them.,9
Well that’s okay isn’t it? They deserve to know and Sunny doesn’t deserve a lifetime of guilt looming over him. If they hate him that’s their choice to make. I think there is a reason that the player sees their reaction. No matter what happens, telling the truth is better than succumbing to that overwhelming guilt.,7
And thinking Basil won't move away like Sunny and then he'll be like "hey guys I know you probably hate me but come on, wanna hang out? \-I mean...wanna spend time together?",2
well it's more about sunny forgiving himself than anything. life will never get back to where it was. entire game is sad af but at least with the truth out sunny is at a place where he can start to \live life\ again,1
NO, DON'T!,180
I can see that, but honestly it might actually help Hero. As awful as the truth is atleast in the end her death was an accident.. . I'm sure a big part of his depression is feeling that despite loving her so much he couldn't see problems that would lead to a suicide and I bet he harbored a ton of guilt for not "seeing the signs".. . Knowing that she really was happy being alive could mean a lot to him.,497
I would, but I'm with you on how Hero might actually do that. The guy bottles up his emotions like the sniper from tf2 bottles up his piss.,468
Best case is Hero's depression worsens, worst case Sunny goes flying down a set of stairs,185
I just can’t see Hero doing this, he’s just too kind. I think he would just say “It’s ok Sunny, it was an accident” and think about it after.,50
I would. Sunny was 12.,3
Right? This is so well done *-*,38
It's basically Space Ex-Boyfriend, but Space became IRL.,80
... Good thing Sunny knows Persist, huh,60
You should also take note that Hero was reaaaally hurt, in Kel's retelling of how Hero's first year went, it really shows how much Mari's death hurt him. He probably wouldn't resort to frikin murder, but I think he'd feel that way,88
Yeah, agree. Mari’s been gone for years now, and obviously, that doesn’t make what Sunny did (as a child! entirely unintentionally! causing himself the greatest trauma!) okay, obviously, but... first of all, Hero just isn’t... the kind of person to seek out revenge in such a manner, I think, and I think he of all people would be able to understand that accidents happen (no matter how bad), and people change over the years (especially at such a young age).,67
Don’t forget the fact Hero was blaming himself for Mari’s “suicide”... Since her death he was everyday breaking his head looking for memories that could give an hint of suicidal behavior on Mari.. Thinking “how it was possible? how i didn't have realize about it before?”. ... So, is more than forgive Sunny and Basil for the murder, it’s forgiving them for the lie and making feel them guilty about Mari’s death,48
Sunny is an unreliable narrator.. . That was quite literally just him hyping himself up to deal by using the most sympathetic ideas of his own friends.. . Honestly, Sunny probably is a bad person. He isn't a fucking psychopath, but damn.,13
I agree that Hero wouldn't actually attack Sunny, but we've seen that he bottles up his anger, and when it comes out it comes out HARD. I imagine he would briefly fantasize about doing this, immediately be disgusted with himself for thinking of doing such a thing, and ultimately just leave and not talk to Sunny or Basil for as long as possible for fear of flipping out at them.,1
You just know the only thing he said was "I killed Mari" lol,1
Que furious basil stabbing hero in the eye,5
I think Aubrey is trying to hold Hero back.. She failing,of course,but its the thought that counts.,27
Sunny, if you've read the text associated with each of the photos in black space, you would notice he was so shocked he had no idea what was happening until after Mari was hanged.. . And he didn't mean to kill her in the first place, it was an accident.,40
What the person above me said, he's not a bad person. Doing something bad doesn't make you a bad person. Having bad intentions makes you a bad person.,18
"I didn't mean to; it's just   M U S C L E   M E M O R Y",485
Spoiler tag didn't go through,171
LMAO DUDE,69
[deleted],6
yeah i dont think i remember him having one,8
Like someone said above, Hero may have blamed himself for Mari's death. But knowing Hero, he wouldn't lose his temper over an accident, for something that has happened years ago.,393
> I don't see any room for improvement of either Hero's or Sunny's conditions.. . Hero: Hes using sublimation as his coping mechanism. Like hes a textbook example of it. He will continue doing that, I cant see him holding true resentment towards Basil and Sunny.. . Sunny: this guy is messed up big time psychiatrically. He has full blown dissociative fugue going on. Gets better at the end but I cant see him fully recovering from this.,116
I got the feeling Aubrey kinda knew the whole time,11
are you real? sunny been a hikikomori for 4 years or whatever and now he shared with his friends what he couldn't even admit to himself. It's only up from here. with or without hero. **a** **life without hero is better than a life with omori**,5
Sunny was 12.,1
I love this interpretation! I think there’s a weird sort of expectation that endings (and themes? characters? subplots? more?) have to be black and white (heh), good or bad, that there has to be a clear delineation of things, but that’s really.. not the case. I think it really adds to the narrative, for it to not be a perfectly/complete happy end for all (obviously, it couldn’t be, given the fact that Mari’s dead, but even setting that aside).,70
> It may be just me, but I feel like whether or not Sunny's friends choose to forgive him is not the point of the ending. . I mean, the crux of the entire Omori fight WAS whether or not his friends would actually forgive him for his actions. If that wasn't the point of the ending then it seems silly to make it the focus of what is ostensibly the climax of the entire story. If his friends didn't end up forgiving him, then the conclusion drawn is that Omori was right, because they were the one suggesting such.,65
Plus, it’s not like any of them have to see Sunny anymore. He’s outta there.,26
(I just beat the game and decided to browse the sub, so sorry for a 20 day late reply) I completely agree with you actually. It really feels like there's a whole missing chapter of Sunny's character development to justify an outburst against Mari. It's much easier to forgive Aubrey almost killing Basil because we see and understand both of them as characters. But all we know about Sunny is that he's introverted, and a throwaway line that dream Mari says about pushing him too hard with the violin. Even if it was an accident, I just cannot fathom what compelled Sunny to push Mari. Not to mention what compelled both him and Basil to drag her (possibly still alive) body back up the stairs, into a bedroom, formulate a plan to stage a suicide, and finally execute said plan instead of trying to find help. Not to mention the difficulty of physically pulling off the staged suicide. Really weird twist in my opinion, I think it being a suicide would have been enough of a twist on its own, but maybe that was the intention all along. It just really leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that Mari literally did nothing wrong.,35
They were scared kids who didn’t want to be blamed for murder. They did the only thing they could think of at the time to absolve themselves of the crime. The one piece of evidence that couldn’t be cleaned up easily, the violin, was locked away. Somehow, this terrible plan worked out for them, so both Sunny and Basil had to carry that guilt in silence. In Sunny’s case, he locked himself in his house for years and stopped talking all together, at least until the last scene of the good ending. . . No one has committed the same actions as Sunny, but I don’t think that means he can’t be related to. Have you ever made a big mistake that you had to hide from everyone? Have you told a lie that you’ve had to keep for years? Have you kept a secret that you feel you’ll have to keep to your grave? These experiences come with similar feelings of guilt and despair and I think many can see that in themselves, when going through Sunny’s story. . . Even if you can’t relate to Sunny, I still think you can put yourself in Sunny’s shoes. I felt genuinely conflicted on telling the truth to Sunny’s friends. I wasn’t sure whether or not it was fair to burden them with knowledge in order to help save Sunny, but the game itself gives a pretty convincing argument to forgive and move on. I think it’s interesting how the good ending of the game tests not only the morals of Sunny, but also the players. Maybe you have a different interpretation though and that’s totally fair, but to me discovering what happened the night Mari died was when everything clicked together.,5
They went through so much just to get their group back together and finally trust each other. I think they'd forgive Sunny. Not forgiving would imply they hadn't healed at all. Honestly I feel like the truth would give a lot of closure. Aubrey didn't understand why basil and sunny became closed off, now she does. They now know that she didn't commit suicide so hero would no longer blame himself for thinking he wasn't there for her. Basil and Sunny would now have a weight off their shoulders and be able to truly heal. It's also not like it was on purpose, the whole thing was an accident. Shutting Basil and Sunny out would solve nothing and only result in more pain for everyone.,4
\*basil drowning noises intensify\*,81
Yep, this is the take I’m on board with. Obviously, a huge part of, well, everything, is the fact that Mari’s Gone, but it’s not everything. Survivor’s guilt and the horror of (thinking that) you could’ve known and prevented it, would undoubtably be extremely heavy, and to know that it was an accident (albeit with someone clearly at fault) largely relieves that.,207
Yup, from what I gathered from the game and my knowledge of psychiatry, Hero is basically a perfect example of the Sublimation coping strategy. . . Meaning he takes his emotions and sorrow, and puts that energy into socially acceptable and constructive behavior. Studying being an A student, going to med school. . . I couldnt see someone with a mature coping strategy going apeshit on Sunny and Basil.,122
This is an excellent silver lining. Knowing that Hero thought he messed up by not picking up on anything while Mari never actually hung herself was eating away at me until I got the true ending.,94
That is a wonderful comparison.,132
You sure that's the worst case chief?,81
this. when hero was depressed over maris death, he kept to himself a lot and went on studying. itll be an internal conflict but he wont hurt sunny.  knowing it was an accident.,35
SUNNY used PERSIST. . Hero:. bro what the fuck you literally have a crack in your skull.,89
That's a good point but I don't think Sunny changed all that much. That was part of the idea of whitespace. He changed enough to start forgiving himself but for the past 4 years he'd been at pretty much a developmental standstill.,24
I wanna agree but I don't agree that Sunny is a bad person. This entire game and the dream world literally shows you that. If you've seen the transcript for what happened on the day of Mari's death, you'll know it was an accident and he didn't even mean to hurt Mari. Covering it up as a suicide was really fucked up but they were kids. They're still kids. And being meta here, we technically aren't being told the story by Sunny. It's the devs telling the story- so they try and use as much symbolism or other artistic shit to tell us how things are.,51
Fair enough lol, Basil is not gonna be happy about doing all this over again,17
Heh,3
"it wasn't my fault it was just, it just became a hobby idk why i am doing this.",122
yeah, sunny pushed mari down the stairs and she died, basil was there and helped sunny stage it as a suicide,123
He still grieves Mari's death to this day. you can see it both when you visit her grave and when he visits the piano room at the middle of night, he breaks down crying. The only reason he's sociable now is because he'd lashed out at Kel during the first year of Mari's death; so I believe he could still lose his temper, though he may not necessarily harm Sunny.. . I've come around a bit about Hero forgiving Sunny though. As a comment on this post mentioned, the main thing that still keeps Hero away from finding piece himself is the survivor's guilt he's got left from Mari's suicide, that maybe if he'd seen the signs, she could've been saved. It's the driving force that made him choose to follow a career in medicine instead of the culinary arts. But there is a silver lining. While it will be incredibally hard, frustrating, confusing, and maddening for Hero to learn the truth, it also acts as a catalyst for him to come around Mari's death, that he is in fact not guilty, and finally find piece of mind. He may not forgive sunny ever; maybe even revulsed at the mention of his name, but he did finally help him put his guilt to rest, and so Sunny has at least partially paid has debt.,521
Except for spiders, of course.,8
I don't think he'd ever *fully* recover but it's like the ending song, he'd keep carrying on and trying to make improvements in his life even if he's been filled with the kind of trauma no one should ever have to go through.,29
how,3
>sunny been a hikikomori. . english please,1
Yeah, but from a personal standpoint I don’t think it matters. Sunny’s fears about whether or not his friends would forgive him was keeping him from coming clean and finally being able to overcome and heal from that traumatic event. In the end, he overcomes those fears - He doesn’t know if his friends will forgive him, but he admits to his mistakes anyway, which allows him to begin the process of overcoming his guilt and accepting what happened instead of the outright denial of the dream-world.. . It is not a blanket positive ending, but I feel like the take of “My friends definitely wont forgive me, so I should never come clean or accept the reality of what happened and try to finally move on with my life” doesnt really make a lot of sense.. . It’s a happy ending for Sunny, if bittersweet. It’s a happy ending for Basil too. You can literally see the physical manifestations of their guilt and anxiety dissipate after Sunny admits what happened - they have finally begun the healing process.,101
You’d be surprised what anger, stress and panic will make you do, at that point, you’re emotions have absolute control over you. And remember, we don’t know what was said when Mari confronted Sunny about the violin, nor the majority of what happened before that point.,64
[This might help, though it was unused. so take it how you want.](),31
>(I just beat the game and decided to browse the sub, so sorry for a 20 day late reply) . . Yeah 10 months late doing the samw lmao,3
Meanwhile hero saved basil first before sunny,30
absolute worst case is a repetition of the game through the perspective of another character, though i doubt that someone like hero would go that far,51
well uhh...he did go through serious depression and verbally assault kel to the point of crying.....,7
Sunny is built different,25
 "oh no i'm approaching sunny's body and picking it up". . \*basil hangs sunny's body\*. .  "What do you mean muscle memory?". .  "uh-". .  "How do you even know how to tie that correctly? Were you *also* involved in the murder of my honey sweetie darling gravy-chan!?". . \*hero shoves basil down the stairs and hangs both of their bodies above their beds\*,90
use spoilers,18
I think Hero would understand that Sunny and Basil were just kids that panicked in an awful situation and come around to forgiving them at some point. It would probably take years, though, and I think he'd probably be more mad at *himself* for wanting to hate two kids that've gone through hell and back if anything. So yeah, things would still suck for Hero. But I don't think he'd hate Sunny.,109
Very good analysis!,58
A shut in, its from were the game got its name from,3
Thank you for the link. I think it does provide more context, and now I'm more comfortable with the fact that the whole event could have happened. I think the game could have done a slightly better job at showcasing Mari's perfectionism (though it would have been difficult because of the whole unreliable narrator stuff) and Mari's bad knee, but I've otherwise come to terms and forgiven Sunny. Which I guess is the whole point of the game. All I can say at this point is good job Omocat,19
I do enjoy thinking about your point of view, but I was joking. Framing sunny as the bad guy is entertaining for someone who knows people who've gone through (relatively) similar circumstances, as they never turn out to be an intentionally bad person. 'Course, I don't believe the word bad is meant to be used as a description of anything besides inanimate objects and human actions. Anyway, I framed sunny because it was funny. with the experience I have, a person who can't tell if they meant to kill someone usually didn't mean to kill someone.,18
first off he learned his lesson. second theres a differnce with how you loosely you treat your family compared to outsiders,10
Exactly. They were just kids afraid of being punished/hated and Hero knows how much Sunny loves Mari. He would never intentionally kill her. I'm sure he'd be mature enough to understand that and realize Mari's death was just a really unfortunate accident.,17
Agreed, very well said,14
Kel is just the sweetest thing ever♡,505

Only true chads already saw this in youtube,15
he isn't wrong,9
Honestly, this is the kind of tonal dissonance I felt through much of the game. Especially in Sweetheart's castle and Humphrey. I get that this dichotomy is intended to evoke the feeling of the main character's obvious escapism, but it eventually just made me feel disconnected from the weight of the events.,8
At least they can agree on something,7
This is canon now,7
i hold kel very gently,5
Kel is always so quick to judge. Have he ever considered that the robber might've accidentally murdered batman's parents? Just like how Aubery >!accidentally almost killed Basil and how Sunny accidentally killed Mari!<,5
It’s canon, boys,5
I can't believe Kel met Batman.,3
wait no, this makes Kel and therefore OMORI canon in the DC universe go back before its too late,3
this is where the mugger killed my parents Kel... . ay man you got any games on your batphone,3

Its is confirmed 100% don't you read the news,1

Sorry, I suck at explaining,1
fucking watch me. . you gonna name your child fucking basil/pesto??,12

Sunny still remaining neutral while striking that pose is just what gets me,205
>!they were beaten to death by aubrey and hero shortly afterwards!<,208
>!This raises a lot of questions, where did Mari go? How did she survive? Did she go to the city and start a new life? Who came up with the idea that they would prank the rest of the group by faking Mari's death? Was basil apart of it? I'd not, did they have to improvise the get Mari down from the tree? When and how did sunny get in contact with Mari, was not leaving his house for 4 years apart of the prank? Why specifically 4 years after her "death" did they finally decide to pull the curtain. And finally, how in God's name did Mari get into that hospital. Then again, I'm elaborating on a meme so who really won in the end?!<,132

Mari went quiet for four years just for a joke, what commitment,7
Omg i wish so bad. Even as a joke ending. Like the dog ending of Silent Hill 2.,8
Does that mean the headspace parts of the game are just normal dreams,7
plot twist: mari is actually dead, she just is now on our world as a spirit,6
A small goof that went on for over 4 years. Its official mari is the absolute prank god.,6
We do an unbelievably colossal amount of trolling.,7
Mari & Sunny was just doing a little trolling!,6
I can just imagine all of them just start sobbing,6
Ah yes, 4 whole years for a joke,7
Them near a staircase:  . **Hero tagged Mari**,7
lol.,4
Bruh, in Bo-en's voice,6
The copium i need,5
Incoming induced Oyasumi, now in stereo.,4
aubrey would start hitting sunny with her spiked bat no joke,5
God I wish. I couldn't finish the game once I pieced together what was happening. Made me too sad.,5
Mari : so i heard you beat the shit out of my brother and kel. . Aubrey :  **sweats**,5
You know what. If this was real this would. Definitely surpass the knife ending,6
Omori fans after >!pushing their sister down the stairs and having their best friend hang them to cover it up!< as an omori reference,5
Mari: (to Hero) Bit mean of me to spring it on you like that, I know. Could've given you a heart attack, probably still will but in my defence it was quite funny.. . Hero: *stares at Mari*. . Mari: Okay, maybe it's not a great defence.... . Basil: You're.... . Mari: Oh, yes.. . Basil: Oh my god.. . Mari: Mmm, not quite.. . Basil: You're >!dead!!<. . Mari: No. . . Basil: >!You're dead, you fell down a flight of stairs!!<. . Mari: No, I'm quite sure, I checked.,6
Sunny, and Mari do a little trolling.,5
Lol who drew this,3
If only it was that simple,3
Alright we failed to kill them both tell the snipers to take them out,3
"small",3
Ha..ha..,4
They boutta get tagged,4
Thanks, I hate it. . . (joking),4
We do little trolling,5
The ending we all want,5
She was just sleeping guys it was just a prank bro,4
It was a prank bro. The prank:,3
Kel is in this meme so it's canon,3
This is my headcanon now. Thanks.,4
w h a t   t h e   f u c k,4
is this a cr1tikal reference,4
Hahaha... if only.,4
Just a little trolling,4
no kel, sorry cant be canon 😔😔😔,3
i wish,4
How I imagine Aubrey and/or Hero would react. . [,4
Plot Twist: Mari last ditch attempt to make everyone happy, before realizing she's floating because she's a spirit because she's dead,5
"throwing my sister down the stairs at 3am prank (Gone wrong!)",4
I think kel would laugh,3
I would prefer this ending.,3
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES,3
No, you won’t wriggle out of this conversation by making a joke.  I must prove to you that you’re insane for having conceived such a base idea.  There are quite a few things that you and I don’t admit, aren’t there?  We don’t admit that a slap in the face in and of itself dishonors a person; that’s both a stupid and harmful prejudice, nothing more.  But then, do you have the right to subject a man to such a slap to the face?  Why, that would constitute a base criminal act on your part and would deprive a person of his peace of mind.  Do you understand, you fool?  Do you understand that if I love another person, and you demand that I give him a slap in the face (which, according to both you and me, is pure nonsense, rubbish), do you understand that if you demand this, I’ll consider you to be a fool and a base man?  If you force me to do it, I’ll either you or myself, depending on whose life is more expendable.  I’ll kill you or myself, rather than do what you demand.  Do you understand that, you fool?  I’m talking about a man and about a slap in the face, which, although an absurdity, can still deprive a man of his peace of mind.  Besides men, there are also women on this earth, and they are also people.  Besides a slap in the face, there are other kinds of nonsense, which we rightly believe to be nonsense, but which also deprive people of their peace of mind.  Do you understand that if you subject another person (even a woman) to some form of what we rightly believe to be nonsense (it doesn’t matter what form), do you understand that such an act is disgusting vile, and dishonorable?  Do you hear me?  I’m saying that your scheme is dishonorable.,5
I mean that ending it's literally more worse than the Bad Ending. At least Mari isn't dead :),2
*Hero became enraged*. *Aubrey became enraged*. *Kel became enraged*. *Sunny became afraid*. *Mari became afraid*,2
*clown honking noises can be heard in the distance*,2
,2
ngl would be pretty good 😭😭,2
YouTube be like,2
sunny and mari doing a little bit of trolling,2
Plot twist it's just someone who happens to look exactly like Mari,2
Basil:”….  Sunny….     Mari….       THE AMOUNT IF FUCKING THERAPY I HAD TO GO THROU-“,2
Finally, the good and goofy ending,2
DONT LOOK AT THE ARTITS OTHER WORKS,2
I genuinely want this to be the case, or at least for someone to make a story based on this. I cannot stop crying every time I see omori content.,1
I didn’t know Mari had the Dead Ringer.,1
imagine is that was a secret ending,1
“It was just a goof it was just for laughs ahaha why arent you laughing?”-Moist critikal,1
If Basil was in it he would would just chuckle nervously!. . . If he wasn’t he would probably have a mental breakdown. (poor child),1
Cop: "Are you pressing charges?". . Sunny: "Hell yeah.",1238
Then sunny removes his eye patch and reveals that his eye was actually fine, it was actually ketchup. . "Just kidding, Thank you for helping me out basil.". . "Your welcome.",785
"Im goro majima now.",81
Me making the 999th upvote:. . I guide others to a treasure I cannot posses,30
Basil: oh...o-okey then.,25
That would be the best way to cut off ties with your friends,851
The 4 year long setup,187
[removed],57
Someone have to make thi an AU,6
Not good for the gang.,520
"""good""",15
yeah XD,56
: they won't see jt coming,26
Considerable amounts of tomfoolery,289
“We do a little bit of trolling here”,197
We do a bit of trolling,50
Mari is the ultimate troll, Sunny is just the unfortunate helper XD,18
"Y-yes I know it was a  prank hahaha... *Hides bloody scissors*",376
maybe.,20
"the cameras right there!",4
Basil had to do his ol' shtick again,96
Their parents were probably in on the joke and she just moved in with her dad.,128
well I'll just put what I think about this:. . \-maybe she stayed in an apartment in the city with her father (since quite possibly the parents were also part of the "Prank").. . \-maybe she fakes her hanging with some trick (something similar as revealed in the sherlock holmes movie).. . \-It was Mari's idea, that's very obvious.. . \-I don't know if Basil was also an accomplice or not, that to each one with their interpretation of that.. . \-the part of how they improvised to get Mari down from the tree to be honest is a mystery to me...maybe it was the father or some anonymous helper...the truth is that I don't know.. . \-It could be that Sunny secretly maintains contact with Mari during those four years, and is very possibly that his isolation was part of the "Prank".. . \-maybe they decided to reveal everything since they saw that their(Mari) "Prank" went too far.. . \-Mari pretends to be a patient so she could easily infiltrate in the hospital.. . Well what else can I say, Mari is going to be in serious trouble giving explanations and apologizing for such a "Prank",57
Nah, she only materialized to accompany Sunny and thus help him during the confession.,30
But you don’t have to Kel is in the bottom left corner so that means it’s canon 😳,184
Hero: I BLAME ME FOR FOUR YEARS FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS ALL A JOKE!?...HOW DARE YOU MARI!? \*proceeds to leave the room running in tears of deception\*. . Mari: Oookey this did not turn out as well as expected.,57
And that for what?...Mary is not dead, he must be happy about it (only in this case).,7
Close,1
Dude, itd probably end with those two getting beaten to death by aubrey and hero,16
yeah,6
trust me, you wouldn’t want to know. I think the OP didn’t credit them for a reason… but I can get the artist for you, if you’re sure you really want to see their other Omori arts…,59
Why? do tell 0-0,51
W....what is it Abraham....?,13
Who?,11
Its Kokomi isn’t it,8
she used the same trick that sherlock holmes reveal (if you have seen the movie you will understand me).,10
eemm I think I'm confused, ¿Kel and Aubrey are going to beat up Sunny or just take care of him...while Hero is going to "take care" of Mari?.. . well I don't know what to think but I can only say that this "prank" went...too far XD,8
I SEE HIM IN THE CORNERW,18
Yes and causing a trauma to Sunny for real this time XD but I doubt Hero and Aubrey will do that...is just a joke a mari's joke haha.,7
this is the true secret ending XD,3
damn straight pal,5
well...this is a super secret ending,6
Mewo has been very, very bad.,14
¿Faking her death for four years causing: trauma, depression, regret and loneliness all just for playing a joke?...NOPE...she is going to pay, Aubrey and Hero may end up disappointed with Mari for...this, and well Hero might break up with her (since her "joke" went too far).. . Mari is going to have to apologize for such a "joke".,9
might be the ears? or shes alive? idk,6
Aubrey: Y-You fucking died for a joke.... . Mari: Yes, and I regret absolutely nothing.,20
They are all part of the prank too. Mari Is just drugging everyone and tricking them into thinking they are going on grand dream like adventures. Everyone actually thinks they are the ones dreaming too.,7
She will explain what really happened, since Sunny still can't speak so she will have to speak for him.,5
the whole gang: ¡Mari you FOOL!,3
Hero: Mari.....go get the pizza.. . Mari: oh shit.,2
Rather she is going to hitting Mari since it was all Mari's idea (the "prank") and sunny is just her unfortunate (and obligated) accomplice.,5
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),7
Aubrey: he he he I-i c-can explain.. . Mari: You better do it.,4
Sorry pal but Kel is there...so this is canon now,5
Aubrey and/or Hero: oh so that was all just a...prank, heh heh heh hahahahahahahahaha oh Mari you and your jokes =) \*proceed(s) to approach menacingly\*. . It was at this moment that Mari knew...she f\*cked up.,4
heh heh i feel sorry for Basil XD,265
But he still got an infection from smearing ketchup in his eye,397
after that Basil questions reality.,59
TOMATO MADE FROM CLOTH,23
Aubrey: *Walks to the park*. Sunny: *Randomly gets out of a dumpster with a knife* AUBREY-CHAN,64
lol,90
boo.. . . . . . . cake.,3
If by predicting the future you mean planning to do something and then doing it, then yep!,75
fr,2
I would almost argue this is worse than her being dead. The sheer trauma and agony everyone’s gone through for **years** only to find out she was alive this whole time would be soul crushing. Imagine hanging your sister’s corpse after realizing you murdered her by mistake and then years later finding out she’s alive and it was a “prank”,710
yeah, They are going to feel deluded and disappointed with Mari, ¡girl pretending your death is not funny!.,17
Incredible ammounts of >!destruction of his mental health!<,174
"We do a massive amount of tomfoolery",79
Yes, the parents were also accomplices,41
I imagine if she tried to make it look like a prank she'd try to pat Sunny on the back only for her fingers to waft through his body.,28
Kel is there so this is Canon now xD,24
I would like to see their other Omori artwork, my curiosity has been piqued,24
If it’s Kokomdraws like I think it is, she’s drawn sexualized drawings of some of the characters, including the headspace ones.,81
I'm thinking of the way he survived The Reichenbach Fall in BBC Sherlock.,3
Summarizing: >!If they not start running now Sunny will be forced to commit Oyasumi and Mari will fall from the stairs for real.!<,14
It might be her pose . Or maybe she just looks too tall,8
oh my god mari XD,3
Sunny dies from his ketchup infection and Mari kills herself for real,447
And then flees faraway and finds some weird as robot monk and becomes a robotic green nija that can deflect anything,12
Hero aids aubrey in the battle and unleash a bunch of heat actions,26
Perfect,13
At that point. Sunny wouldn't need a hospital. He'd need a morgue.,410
I think Mari took her "Prank" too far...but EXTREMELY far.,49
If I was Hero and Mari did that to me I would dump her ass,21
I love it,8
Well no cause by the look of it sunny was in on the prank so basil would have gotten the most trauma unless he was in on it aswell but by the game play that doesn’t seem true as they both seem to show trauma  even when alone so-,1
*everyone's,32
I just hope that doesn't give the poor Sunny a heart attack XD,10
[ here it is... idk if this artist has any other kind of media, but i found the guy on pixiv sooo... there you go.,32
CabronPR actually,56
Ewy,16
Oh...and here I was about to joyfully ask for the source...,6
Thnxs ill be sure to dislike,13
damn  i kinda regret having the name "kokomi" now.,2
oh hahahahahahahahahahaha, Well in defense of Sunny he is just an accomplice for me that whole prank was Mari's plan so she is gonna pay the consequences.. . go for the pizza Mari because Hero and the others are waiting for XD,9
[removed],69
Oh go jump in a lake - no that's lame - oh go get pizza,3
2nd times the charm,158
Considering how he watched Ghost Mari play the piano with absolutely no ill reactions I think he'd just tell Mari to drop the act.,21
Thank you!,15
Expected gore or necrophilia. Atleast it isn’t that I guess.,2
Wow, that sure is sexualized drawings of Omori characters, including the headspace ones,43
*Curb your happiness*,97
Hmmm good point, Sunny may be the type who doesn't get upset with supernatural things (as it seems to be a normal thing in his life).,13
Why are you so enthusiastic about this?,24
🤨,2
I’d watch an Omori anime/movie ngl,694
Ah. Now I would get to watch >!Mari fall down the stairs!< in full video? Ah yes. Pain, but 100x worse!. . In all seriousness, would FUCKING LOVE to see something like this.,360
Nice art! The asthetic kinda reminds me of Wonder Egg Priority. Oh god now I want an Omori anime done in WEP's style.,115
Omorime,88
Remember how To The Moon somehow got an anime? (Well it's been a while so you never know if it got cancelled or not.),46
Omori would actually work as an animation. It doesn't rely on its medium like Undertale does.,34
✨Shiny hair✨,26
I REQUIRE THIS,20
Aubs!,18
oh this is pretty well done, good job,18
Yo this looks sick, gonna do more characters?,16
Aubrey best girl is now Aubrey best waifu,30
Omori Anime adaption?  . . . SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEYYY,14
*NOOO AUBREY IN HD I CANT DO IT NOOO-*,12
Nice work.. . For some reason, this quote reminded me of the game Lone Survivor...hmm.,11
i love this soo much. . oc?,13
is this just a drawing/idea? or do you really want to make a fan anime? because if this is going to be a project i really want to see it grow.. . . but if it is just verry nice art than keep drawing it is beautiful it is a 100 times better than al my verry bad art :D,11
YOOOOOOOOOOO HOLY SHIT,10
This is some dope art. I was thinking if they were to make the game into like a show they could get the dudes behind Adventure Time/Midnight Gospel. I feel like they would get the style right,9
Anime Aubrey is the new religion,8
Sunny, probably: No.,5
Boku No Fantastic World,3
They NEED to make an Omori anime,3
I would 100% watch an omori anime,3
She reminds me of another anime character...,2
Did she just tell me to touch grass?,2
Touch grass its important,2
I WILL DONATE ALL MY LIFE SAVINGS FOR AN OMORI ANIME ADAPTATION!!!!!!! LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,2
ikr, the plot feels like it could be easily adapted too,358
i feel like it would have less impact emotionally than the game but it would be cool to see,60
Well, there's always Anohana, which has a really similar plot (minus the dream world stuff) and themes.,30
[removed],-96
Oh, and this frame of Anime Aubrey is beautiful, thank you.,145
>!the entire stairs incident on loop. . .now in HD!!<,114
Discovering the truth and let it run in your head at your own pace are 2 different things. I wonder how an animator will be able to reproduce that effect,45
120fps 2160p 32:18,13
Not gonna lie, WEP gives me major Omori Vibes. From the music to the themes.,53
I think CloverWorks (the studio for Wonder Egg Priority), A-1 Pictures (the studio for Anohana), or Kyoto Animation could pull it off (if OMOCAT could get either studio to adapt OMORI as an anime).,21
To The Moon 3 is coming out so that's probably taking up time. Kan said the budget is cleared and a couple big names are working on it so I doubt it's cancelled,14
it was actually going to be a manga originally, i think everyone knows this but yeah. . i do think the "sunny fucking stabs aubrey" scene kind of works better as a videogame to make the player wake up and pay attention to the real world, but that's a single scene in a big game,32
i’ll definitely do more! i just don’t know which character to draw so any suggestions is great :),20
oc :),15
Considering a lot of things in the game are inspired by Japanese RPG and anime, that is the case for everyone. The first trailer song (My Time iirc) is half in Japanese and Omori is short for Hikkikomori, which is Japanese for shut-in.,159
Yeah, but... wich route would thet adapt?,10
Jokes on you, I’m on mobile and the browser starts out as muted!,41
Please don't reproduce...,22
i hate you,18
I hope you don't ever breed with a human,14
I honestly expected a rick roll when i saw the replies.... . Apparently it's **something** worse.,29
touche to you, a man of culture,5
Upvoted.,-14
Tihi,29
Running on RTX 3090 with full 60fps 8K,6
>!Imagining the scenes where Sunny's flesh is ripped apart as he comes to terms with the truth and sees himself fully as a monster, but animated, would be... something!<,12
Maybe it could work as in Sunny is walking around(in reality it's in his own head) and then seeing the Memories of what truly happened and then slowly putting the Memories together with the Build up(Like the.  Memories being inconsistent in the Order and Sunny having to place them in the right order) and then leading up to the Full Picture of the Truth? . . It will make the Audience go from "What's happening?" To "Wait this is the truth?" And then to "No Way, this is not real.",2
is it worth a watch? I see the blue haired girl a lot but I haven't heard anything about the quality of the show,5
God, imagine the smoothness of Kyoto Animation for Omori.,10
yo imagine if the quality is like A silent voice or Violet Evergarden if kyoani animates it.,2
I imagine that they could integrate some of Sunny's first person POV, like playing off of how he sees the world like an RPG, similarly to the game. At the Aubrey fight, it could be like normal, and then when Sunny stabs her, everything kind of *breaks* and Sunny gets snapped back to reality by Aubrey falling to the ground, slow-mo ish.,20
you can do sunny.,15
hero is my favorite! I'd love to see him talking about Mari at the cemetery,3
There's also a lot of wordplay for the term omori. It could be "omori" as in "weight" (noun), or oomori as in "large forest," which is an area in the game (vast forest) but also >!where the treehouse is!<. . the adjective for weight is "omoi," which can also be used as "emotions/feelings," tying in to the battle system's emotion system. As well as how central to the plot emotions are,107
CLOSE,10
The true ending, and make the other endings OVA's,14
What did they post?,2
You got my curiosity peaked. Please tell me so that I may never click on it and potentially scar myself.,23
It definitely is worth a watch, especially if you liked Omori since the themes align. The show remains steady for 7 episodes but then feels kinda rushed and episode 11 isn't kind of controversial. The actual final episode (which will conclude the series) will release in June. Overall, for me, I really enjoyed it: the art and animation was stellar and the characters were very charming. Most of it was pretty good, and hopefully the last episode will stick the landing. . . Ohh also the first episode is actually one the the best first episodes that I've ever seen in anime. It's gorgeous through and through. Definitely worth it.,11
Im super late but i decided to look through the top posts and i thought of this.. . . Maybe in Headspace there could be textboxes that show a character speaking, to represent how Sunny views headspace like a video game, and that carries over to the real world until he stabs Aubrey when it all fades away/shatters to pieces.,7
Omori also means >!to kill!< in greek,63
clothes,6
I'll check it out!,3
That actually seems like a cool idea, with the Right director,the Right Animators and with just enough time it could be executed pretty well.,4
Oh snap,17
I'm sorry.,1
>!OMORI and Sunny fighting in the corner: *confused screaming*!<,564
I want to make a joke but it’s kind of spoilery, how do I make text spoilered again?,218
Ngl, fighting Kris, Susie and Ralsei in Omori would be hella fun.,172
Lancer would get along with kel,153
**Welcome to White Spa- SUNNY WHO THE HECK ARE THOSE TWO AND WHY ARE THEY IN MY ROOM!?**,71
>!Kris about to push Asriel down the stairs!<,66
I'm loving all these Deltarune X Omori memes we've been getting lately.,40
*You've been here as long as you can remember*,23
\*Kris and omori looks at each other with blank stares\*,19
Oh no, nononono!,9
Imma make a fic about this. . . For some reason sunny is forced to go outside into another country/city with monsters and humans for a few days, he stays at a hotel while his mom deals with some business stuff.. . He gets hungry and decides to go outside to buy something to eat, then he meets berdly by accident, berdly having nothing better to do forces him to hangout with his friends.. . Sunny meets Noelle and other unnamed monsters.. . Berdly learns about sunny not going to school for years and decides bring him there to teach him, "how to be cool at school". . Alphys accepts Sunny as a guest student.. . At some point during class, Sunny decides to go to the bathroom, he then finds Kris and Susie about to enter the mysterious closet.. . Susie being the bully forces sunny to go there first, Sunny enters the room and then Susie and Kris follow him and then the floor falls apart.. . The trio then find themselves in a empty white void with two doors, a white door(headspace) and a gray door(dark world). . Sunny however is no longer there, instead a white and dark version of him is there(OMORI). . Kris then gets confused, this wasnt supposed to happen.. . Susie being confused and angry about whats going on opens the gray door and jumps into the void while trying to find an exit.. . Kris and OMORI jump in as well.. . They find themselves in a barren dark place, Kris  having what appears to be a knight armor and a wooden sword. Kris later encounters OMORI but he didnt change, They later find susie swinging an axe around.. . And so the story begins.. . Also yes im already writting this, dm me for info,14
aw fuck,7
>Kris, [where's the door?](),7
I get the overlap between the fandoms. . tell me Aubrey and susir wouldn't be best friends,7
This is... Somehow.... . &#x200B;. . **LORE ACCURATE IN A WAY WHAT THE FU???**,10
>! What, Kris killed Asriel? !<,6
i would actually love a deltarune and a omori crossover,3
I’m dead, these are hilarious,2
When worlds collide:,2
omori and kris seem like they would get along,2
Plot twist: kris pushed Sussie down the stairs irl,2
>!Susie more like sussy??!< lol,2
Kris: white space.,1
Kris also perfectly fits >!Omori/Sunny's!< role too. >!Silent. Protagonist. Sharp stuff. And also can be a maniac at times!<,1
Dude spoiler tag fuck off🤬🤬🤬🤬😭😭😭,-10
lol.,1
This funny,1
ily,1
I.NEED.THIS,1
YES  . YES  . YES,1
You know. It kinda fits.,1
i am praying deltatraveller  does this,1
**You are waiting for something to happen.**. . (5 minute later). . “Kris… Why the fuck are you just standing there? Are you okay?”. . (10 minute later). . “Um… Are we gonna leave soon? Hello?”. . “You want some moss? I’ll get you some moss if we actually go somewhere.”. . **The thought of moss snaps you out of your trance, and you and Susie continue on.**,1
* A  black lightbulb is hanging from somewhere, it's somehow "shining" darkness. its almost hypnotic, you touch it and pull your hand away due to how cold it is. feeling uncomfortable, you step away from it.. * a black laptop is displaying static, you press a key and a prompt for a password is displayed, unfortunately, you don't the password.. * a drawing notebook is sitting, on the ground, their are several abstract art pieces that make you feel uncomfortable, especially the weird black squid eye thing on the back. . * a tissue box, you don't wanna know what its for if the laptops any indication.. * a black cat is staring at you. It meows at you. you can't help but think that its judging you like most cats do.,1
then we will need to find what happend to ralsei,1
Perfect.,1

You put these > ! Text ! <. . Just make sure that the arrows and exclamation marks don’t have spaces in between.,103
Kris can dodge attacks, but Omori doesn't care and spams Sno-Cones,85
Fighting OMORI, Kel, Aubrey, and Hero in Deltarune would be awesome as well,15
Someone made a rendition of that: ,3
Vice versa too,2
Lowkey wanna see this ngl,55
I agree. Their personalities are so similar since they are both energetic and active. They also serve as their respective fandoms’ “meme” characters, so it’s wouldn’t be surprising if they would get along so well.,13
And mari comes back soon to visit her brother.,17
I am terrified Dess is going to have a stupid death,3
Chara 100% sees Asriel’s death as their own fault and believe the same things about themselves that you get told in the final boss of Omori,3
I'll watch your career with great interest,5
probably not,1
Chara did, according to them, 100%,1
Susie Baka,2
How is this spoilers,4
Befriending every creepy monster down there!,1
how do you spoiler tag again?,44
Edited, it now has spoiler tags,8
Thank you. . Anyways, the joke I was gonna make was:. . >!Dark World, Blackspace, it all makes sense..!<,283
And Susie and Aubrey just have a competition on who can hit a baseball farther.,40
Lancer: “So you’re telling me that if you can find out how to make a Dark World that lets all Darkners exist there without turning to stone, that you’d do it so that we could hang out?”. . Kel: “Yup!”. . Lancer: “Sweet!”. . Omori: “I’m pretty sure we could just use BL-“. . Queen: *puts a hand to Omori’s mouth*. . Queen: “Shush trauma boy you almost said spoilers.”,77
I wanna make fanart of this now,8
I FUCKING SPAMMED EMOJIS SO IT'S OVIOUS SARCASM OMG,-9

Most of the games take place in RPG worlds that probably have taken inspiration from their respective real worlds, and the player can explore those real worlds in OMORI and Deltarune !<. - >! To add to the previous one, the player can access those dream worlds by sleeping. !<,56

Oop spoiler tag didn't work. The end should be !<, not <!. . Edit: Nice,11
No sane person would ever spam emojis "you braindead worm",0
>!Like this?!<,6
No, > ! Like this ! <,2
>!oof!<,1
Me too,2
Wait what since when did OMORI have a banana meme,,I’m missing out,35
There's also the big brother character who's universally loved by the townsfolk and is coming back home from college.,22
Queen isn't really divorced, I think?When she says she's Lancer's mom the King asks since since when was that decided?. To which she says "Arbitrarily, right now.",14
Well you’re not a sane person,1
Yep, it worked,5
> ! Oh, okay ! <,4
It’s the Eternal Banana, you can find it in that Playground in Headspace.,81
I get that King and Queen are just separated but not really divorced. I only just said “divorced” because I was too lazy to find other words to describe it, though the point is that she is similar to Sweetheart in the sense that they’re aren’t really together with their other significant other anymore/at the moment.,6
Lancer calls >!Queen!< "wild mom" well before they could've met if they met during Chapter 2, so that probably means that Lancer is >!Queen's!< "biological" son.,2
>! Like this? !<,1
>!Deez nuts!<,1
OMORI Get The Banana.,22
Now all we need is a derpy clone, a robotic recreation and an overall better version of Queen and she’ll 100% be “Sweetheart V2”,3
I mean later when they're together in the dark world he talks about how she's like a third father to him and she doesn't even seem to know him at all until that point.,3
Potassium overdose,5
They could've divorced shortly after he was born, or just left.,2
Exactly, it's eternal, after all, the queen would love it as it is eternal,7
Aubrey would assault a mcdonalds employee to make sure sunny gets his burger done right,479
You think sunny still orders happy meals?,435
Aubrey: "Excuse me, what the hell is this?". . McDonald's employee: "A kids toy?". . Aubrey: "IT'S A GIRLS TOY". . Basil: "Aubrey, it's fine, I like the pink jump rope". . Aubrey: "No! It's about principles! I'm not going to let . them get away with this!". . Employee: "Huh? Are you threatening me? I'm not scared of you.". . Aubrey: "If I were you, I'd be scared of him. >!You're the one who made the mistake of giving him a jump rope!!<",243
pov : you shouldnt have worked at mcdonalds,152
Aubrey has always been Sunny's rock (right after Mari). Aubrey would never let Sunny's order be wrong ~~that's why she keeps the bat~~,92
Art, thank you.,64
Lol my roommate is Aubrey here and I'm Sunny. She's constantly speaking up for me when I'm just like, "Nooo I'll totally take the wrong order! It's not worth the a n x i e t y...",51
Can someone make a comic or a dub of this? I love it lamo,25
Haha but Kel is the one who hates pickles!,20
It’s funny because I had another meme but this one blew up so I’m not posting it rn,16
That’s riGHT,12
Depression: exists. Smol sunny: im about to end this whole mans career,10
My favorite and ship,10
🥺,6
I'm wondering, since when did this "Excuse me he said no pickles" trend came by?,5
This is definitely canon,5
"I'm sorry ma'am, this is just how the burger is supposed to be made 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝓉𝒽𝑒𝓇𝑒 𝒾𝓈 𝓃𝑜𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝒸𝒶𝓃 𝒹𝑜 𝒶𝒷𝑜𝓊𝓉 𝒾𝓉.",3
I like how it looks like they’re mimicking each other’s expressions,3
Where are his hands,2
Spoiler tag(real world aubrey),2
literalmente eu,1
I don’t blame her. That asshole messed up such a simple order for someone so smol that it is punishable by death,353
Obviously he wants them chickie nuggies,323
He orders happy meals just to feel something lmao,101
everyone does, if you don’t you aren’t real.,59
someone doesn't..?,48
he's gotta get them nugs somehow,10
My employee: “I’m not scared of you”. Aubrey with a bat that has giant nails in it: “I’m about to end this mans whole career”,136
Oh. Oh no.,61
" I dont fear you!". "Then you will die braver than most.",54
I’m sorry if this is a whoosh moment but I fail to understand...,22
I feel like an Aubrey in these kinds of situations. “Hey uh this is like not okey dokey. Fix it”,21
It’s a trend? I didn’t know that I just thought it was funny,9
you don't have to spoiler tag characters real-world appearances anymore,34
Ultimate Girlboss,44
why she, isnt sunny male?,34
“wtf is this shit I didn’t order a depression meal”. . “...oh wait”,72
don't make me question my existence!,30
This tag is art, I scrolled down my reddit, saw it, and decided to thank you for tossing it up. That's pretty much it.,23
I need someone like this. So many things have gone wrong in my life cuz I've been too scared to correct someone.,3
my bad, i didnt see the update,4
Suddenly Danganronpa.,4
Typo that I never caught,30
you aren’t real,20
Ah ok,16
thank God, I thought I just mistook omori/sunny's gender this whole time,23
i love how the sunflower ship is basically basil being in love with sunny, but sunny either 1. is completely oblivious to basil’s feelings, or 2. doesn’t feel the same way and is being hilariously blunt about it,647
[deleted],211
Saw it on the twitter, shame how much great art isnt properly recognised between both here and there,187
( I do not allow reposting, if you have seen this comic elsewhere here, it was stolen from me!),250
Ha. Hilarious.,68
classic,46
SUNNY NO PLS,51
I was like hey! I know you! And I was afraid someone has stolen it ahah. Good to know it's you!,43
Gaysil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,22
OMG BASIL SO PRECIOUS!!! (And omg Sunny lmao),49
That's just me and my boyfriend(I'm a basil and hes a sunny kinnie),19
Poor basil,20
Late but I just realized that Sunny would totally fall for Updog,14
Wait did his flower switch place???,11
[deleted],8
i totally ship them both so hard,6
BAHAHAHHA I love it 😭 ✋🏻,11
i mean he did say "it back",6
My account with the correct username is . u/mieldecolza ! I'm going to delete this one because it doesn't have the right name to avoid confusion,5
it back,4
this is amazing,3
DENSE.,3
Ok but the implications,3
love him or hate him, he’s spitting facts,3
He's confused but he got the spirit! ,3
Troll,2
Let's just say that Sunny isn't very *bright*.,2
Poor basil,2

Basil x Omori is so gross. 🤢🤮,1

THIS IS HILLARIOUS,1
BOSSMANHERO SAYS THIS IS CANNON,1

The requirements to complete the set task have not been met. :c,31
Mission failed. . we’ll get him next time,20
Task failed successfully,2
Between upvotes, awards and comments I think artworks are easily the most recognised posts in this forum(maybe after memes idk). . It’s just that the sheer amount of them(not necessarily a bad thing) drowns out some of the good gems,46
Do you have a twitter so I can share it there?,28
Thank you! It's weird that people recognize me here, I used an old nickname haha,30
Yeah, I put no effort into this haha,11
cc bg,7
**amazing, this is.** . . *-jackyyip0211*. . ***. . . . ^(Commands: 'opt out', 'delete'),5
They're just friends.,16
Basil x Sunny tho,5
if you find the same kind of meme I can make one with Kel!,14
Both!,6
I don't understand why people keep complaining when there is no problems to say ''I love you'' to a friend. 🤝,15
Guys can also say "I love you" without it implying any sexual intent. I understand that you're not referring to this post in particular, but if you're gonna complain about free art and memes, at least do so in the proper thread.,16
I don't understand why people keep telling other people to not ship when it doesn't affect them at all. You can just not care you know...,16
sunny having a crush on aubrey when he was younger is canon. aubrey reciprocating his feelings isnt,180
mAILED fISSION 🙂,121
raiden, turn the game console off right now,3
it's @mieldecolza on twitter!,27
Ahah no I only recognized the comic! Didn't know you were on reddit!,11
Undertale was cool before turning cringe, and we both know why that community is weird now... Thats all I'm saying.,5
[deleted],-12
*sees mailed box*. . “Oh wow, here’s my own fission reactor! Thanks man!”,72
THANK,10
Oh okay, but it's the same for me ahah,14
Omori fans aren't making porn and you really shouldn't let a vocal minority of the community ruin the fun for you anyway. Though there should be some limits to shipping, like, you shouldn't ship Kel x Hero because that's just weird and disgusting. But I don't see any problem with people who kin Basil and are also gay so they like to think that Basil is gay, too. I am bisexual myself and I like both Sunny and Basil so I just like seeing them happy together.,11
Well i disagree with you!,37
You welcome man, just don't be surprised if you get cancer-,7
What did he say,6
epic, now watch as i dont downvote you, unlike the reddit hivemimd,12
oh no, is that a giant crab i see?,4
At least theyre a good hivemind that seems to be controlled by someone with an actual working brain,24

The Japanese fanart is a little bit... sussy...,1332
Japanese fanart:[REDACTED]. . American fanart: Burgir :D,335
Japanese fanart by . . American Fanart by ,319
Left image got me feeling not straight.,343
Genuine question. Where did the whole "Kel likes burgers" meme come from? Is there something in the game that I missed, or is it just something made up by the fandom?,116
I swear to the fcking god i will abandon Sunburn and move to Suntan. . . And yeah, the American fandom is dead inside so they live only of memes to sustain theirselfes.. . The japanese fandom is the same thing, but instead of memes they create *horny* fanarts to sustain theirselfes.,92
true,136
Don't worry guys, the left fanart is just Sunny checking if Kel eats enough, everything is fine\~,53
borgir kel over dirty kel any-day fr,113
😳 oh,39
One on the left for sure 😤,90

Don't you love it when you finish a great game, but then the fandom ruins it for you with this nasty stuff. Amazing game, Terrible fans.,2
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES,2
Sunny tried to do it again yesterday. When i pushed him away he pulled out a steak knife and started chasing me,2
We should’ve nuked Japan a 3rd time…(edit:it’s looks like the ladies and gentlemen of this community have been royally angered by my Tom foolery to that I say “Problem?”),-54
Don't you mean a bit, Susny?,587
There's other fanart about Kel's abs and Kel's back . This is the most SFW,473
wdym? it's just some juicy, tender suntan content ready to be consumed,121
We thank you,58
they deleted the account :(,3
back damage is no joke, sit straight now,202
Literally me but with the fanart on the right,87
Borgir 🍔,169
comes from the #humphrey (omori memes) channel in omoricord, the original has sad sunny thinking of his friends in the dream world while kel is thinking about burgers with a remix of the song “murder on my mind” playing that instead says “burgers on my mind” and related stuff. burgers on my mind struck the collective hivemind of #humphrey users and became reposted several times daily, with many spoofs. meanwhile, the mods (or at least one, gilbert) hate it and there’s an automated system to increase or decrease slowmode that has the word “burger” as a trigger to increase it. most recently in yhe kel burgers timelinr, people spammed kel burgers in #humphrey yesterday to celebrate kels birthday. the slowmode got up to like 20 minutes last i checked lmao,95
Sorry but what do you mean with "true"?,58
Wish I could draw like the one on the left,70
10 meters tall Kel 😳,6
What's so gay about Kel eating burgers?,5
Oh sorry for American i was reffearing to the Western Fandom and I know calling ALL West American is wrong sorry again,5

Thank you,30
Man I'm bi do you think I know how to sit?,66

Understandable, have a nice day.,80

I can't even draw like the one on the right,47
10 meters is 10.94 yards,3

Oh I didn’t know there was a funeral, are the fireflies ok?,6
I wonder why Sunny has that body type 🤔,167
[You jest, but the dude who drew the image on the left also drew that](),8
Suncest:,2
break your back trying to quantum sitting in both straight and not,29
LMAOO MOOD,14
Understand have a nice day,74
Me neither.. . But I'm going to learn how to draw like the stuff on the left. . . I will not give up like I did before for 7 years.,17
definitely not bc of his hikikkomori lifestyle, that's for sure,124

I HAVE ACHIVED COMEDY,11
comedeez nuts, trap card!,10
GOD  . . . DAMNIT,10
where the frick are we,8
I hope Mari is happy, regardless of where she is.,296
Every time I think about how Mari and Hero aren't able to be a loving couple in the game's real world I die a little more inside.,282
My thoughts will follow you into your dreams,188
THIS IS SO AMAZING,87
The flowers were a nice touch,80
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD  . BUT IT' S SO SAD,45
Ouchies :( Amazing work though, holy goodness. I can't believe the individuals who epitomize talent casually waltz into the Omori fandom.,40
This is jaw dropping!,22
This is amazing, you have drawn her so well!,18
absolutely beautiful work!,17
Did u draw this :0,13
Painfully good,12
My fucking heart,11
Omfgggg❤❤❤,10
She definitely follows me into my dreams,8
Absolutely stunning.,8
this is so beautiful I’m crying,6
YOUR SKILLS GIMME GIMME,6
I imagine Hero during this event stunned by her beauty, elegance and charm and all she does is tease his reaction because of it.,6
She looks like a mix of mai san from aobuta and touko from yagakimi,4
AIDHDJSS LITERALLY OBSESSED,4

Some of the best fanart I have ever seen. I gave it a hugz award btw.,1
Then she suddenly turns into hellmari and scares the crap out of you,1
"ayo the pizza here",1

Lovely drawing!. . Upvoted! ,1

Its a Game SPOILER ALERT 👉( tho yes she is in the ending in witch you tel your friends in the one where you jump off no in the one with leaving Bazil alone no chuse something is  there and the one where you stab in your sleap no sooooooo ),7
Me too. There is no pure happy end in Omori. Only big pain and little pain,111
Just finished and I'm so devastated about the perfect life they couldve had even if it was unrealistic,44
,4
thank you!,21
yea I thought it might be overkill to add the sunflowers (I only had the orchids at first) but it fills up the space nicely ^^,46
thank you!,12
yes! my Twitter is ,16
:') i'm glad my art evokes that feeling. thank you.,1
REMINDING YOU THAT YOU FORGOT TO SPOILER PROPERLY. . ,2
That's what the game is about. Some mistakes can't be fixed.. . But we still need to move on. And if we're honest with ourselves, we can grow<3,12
Sunflowers are incredible sources of folic acid. 100 g of kernels contains 227 µg of folic acid, which is about 37% of recommended daily intake. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis. When given in anticipant mothers during the peri-conceptional period, it may prevent neural tube defects in the baby.,31
Nice! Have an award.,7
Thanks Sunflower Seeds,5
IT FEELS LIKE HER YOUNG SELF AGAIN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THANK YOU,377
This makes me wanna see an emotion chart of Aubrey with only difference being is she has the same expressions she did as younger.,174

I love it! is she crying?,41
ahh the shading here is amazing!! Just like the watermelon photo <3,40
Man. . This is just amazing,50
I said it once and I'll say it again, I'd commit war crimes to protect that smile. Great job btw,40

XD,1
Uuhhhmmm...,9
I have a few questions,9
We need more Aubrey art with her younger expressions,93
It shows, it really captures that feeling. Great job!,31
the photo of her, the umbrella and the pretty pink jacket  is also awesome,10
Put "I going to going to beat you to death" and it will be the perfect image,40
Yes, give it a try!,8

Nice,10
So is this art, amazes me that people can draw like that aaaaaaa!,8
Thank u <3,5
**More like Several**,3

For real?! Thank you so much OP,9
>gambatte:\],3
Spoilers:. . >!I hanged Mari!<. . >!You hanged with her, right?!<. . .... . >!with her, right!?!<,291
Yes, indeed. \*creepy smile\*,116
found out because people were comparing it to earthbound, and as a diehard earthbound fan i had to check that out.,95
>!Hey Mari I feel stressed out about this recital and want to quit the violin!<. . >!Thats ok we can always keep your violin as a memento to our friends!<. . …. . >!Sunny you do still have your violin right!<,54

Ah yes, old meme templates in Omori style.,23
OMORI used... SMILE?,20
"fuck whoever downvoted my post"  . \-KEL  . ~~hey this is a joke please don't hate me~~,14
I'm taking this for a meme format,11
This art is so cute. I love Omori's face,10
I found out in a pretty weird way. A month ago I saw a [fan animation of chainsaw man]() on youtube (spoiler alert). It was really well done and I liked the music a lot; in the comments I saw people writing stuff like "finally chainsaw man fans meet OMORI fans", I found out the song was called My Time and it was the song of the trailer of a game called OMORI, which I had never heard before. I watched the trailer, then I watched the other two, and then I bought the game,8
I actually convinced my cousin to play it when we finish our terraria play through and he always asked how scary it was,6
No seriously, it IS a cute game.,5
"Well yes but actually no",5
I got it suggested to me on steam the day it came out and was like oh shit I'm still waiting on delta rune so might as well get this lol,3
[deleted],3
My boyfriend is slowly convincing me to play this game because he knows I like dark stories lmao. . I fully plan on playing it,3
Omori doing the Hero smile is definetely blursed,3
when i got sent to white space the first time i was kinda laughing because there was no way the game would get dark this quickly. . >!i was wrong!<,3
Could you link the original post? I can't seem to find it..,2
hey same thing kinda happend to me the first time saw the dream world i was like wow what a cute art and music to and its rpg to i am in but oh boy was i wrong it was not the cute game that i saw good thing i never get scared tho,2
Very cute game yes,2
o-of course its a totally cute and chilling game. especially the endgame level designs are LOVELY ,2
i found out about it by listening to the ost when i was in a pretty bad state of mind and i was like "wow, so cute, i should definitely play this to unwind a bit!" and the next thing i know is i'm having a mental breakdown over pixels. (BUT it actually helped me get myself together and realise i had a choice the entire time),2
Is it? I haven’t played before, and the art looks nice and i like the characters. I have the game, i should play it.,2
That's the thing when I first looked at the game I thought it was just a cute 2d game 😭,2
but of course is a cute game (evil smile).,1
i saw fanart of it on my instagram explore page and it looked cool so i played it,1
Smug Omori is scary.,1
found out because the AYO THE PIZZA HERE led me down a rabbit hole of OMORI memes that give away the entire true route story,1
Ok lemme try !spoiler! Did i do it right,1
I heard about this game from an online friend told me to play this and go into it blind this is how I felt.,1
>!hanging spoiler is not working at the moment!< Edit: Spoiler fixed,90
The spoiler you need to do it like this \>!spoiler!< with no spaces,15
"I wanted to for a while.",1
Which is the better game?,17
me descobriram,19
Old?,8
AUBREY is AFRAID!,11
I know exactly where this is from and I feel like it is concerning,3
want the template?,3
I also found out about Omori in a weird way.. . The first video I saw of it was called "Naming yourself Omori" but didn't really care. . The second one was about sunflowers with Sunny and Basil there on the screen, I liked the characters and I also liked sunflowers, so I searched "Omori" on youtube and found some more videos. . (Since I didn't think I'd buy it I just watched a playthrough of it, but after watching it I bought it anyways. It was just too good not to buy, even if I did know the plot already),3
i found about omori though an r/ena post about ena emotions in the form of omori emotions chart, that day i found a free dl of it and that night i was changed,1
I found out about Omori in almost the same way, except after watching that video it took me about 2 or 3 weeks to find another video and actually be interested in the game,3
Please do! It's one hell of an experience.,2
[This one](). You are welcome.,1
What?,8
For me it's working.. . Edit: I changed it, I don't know. Just in case,6
Let me try >!Did it work?!<,1
Hard to say, you can't compare two masterpieces, just experience them. However I will try to judge them by their content.. . Let's start with the good points about OMORI. The story is much more developed, the character progression is very good, both of which are rivalled only by Mother 3 in the Earthbound trilogy. The RPS battle system is good AND unique, however OMORI's difficulty curve resembles a logarithm than a line. (Aside from Sweetheart, you shouldn't have any trouble fighting bosses. Humphrey doesn't count; he's just an endurance test.) Both soundtracks are fine, though aiming at different goals (OMORI's aims for a bittersweet theme, while Earthbound aims for the comforting nature similar to one's mother. Mostly.). . Concerning the pacing of the game, OMORI starts off strong, only to falter in the Headspace sections (some parts definitely overstay their welcome, though this is probably intended due to Omori's nature to >!protect Sunny from the Truth at all costs!<). and comes back stronger in Black Space, the real world and the ending sequence. Earthbound starts off very weak (The Sharks gang in Onett is not newbie friendly and you may die multiple times trying to get past them, and Twoson features some of the worst effects in the game, Mushroomized and Cold), but stays strong for the rest of the game. (Except the monkey hole section in Dusty Dunes Desert.). . The theme of both games is polar opposite (and this is also felt in the soundtracks of both games). OMORI's is a lot more sad and bittersweet than Earthbound, focusing on remembering old memories lost in time, while the latter is more cheerful and adventurous, focusing on creating childhood memories. The jokes of both games, though, are very much in the same style, which shows that OMORI's main inspiration is Earthbound.. . I would consider OMORI to be the most polished product, however Earthbound, in my opinion, has this incredible charm that will keep it close to my heart. And perhaps, if Earthbound never existed, then OMORI may have turned out very differently...,87
Both, both is good.,15
Both,12
Omori tbh. Take it from an Earthbound fan, a lot of parts of it don't really hold up today and the plot and characters are far less developed. It is a lot of fun though still and a great game. I'd say Mother 3 is a more fair comparison,6

Yes plz!,2
thanks!,1
Nice, ya fixed it. (: . . Or it was some glitch from my screen.,8
it’s working for me,4
Yes,2
I’m playing Earthbound right now for the first time and I’m going through Twoson / Paradise, and I’m already loving it. You’re telling me this is the **worst** part of the game? Wow I’m excited,18
Nice critic. Agree that some parts overstayed their welcome, but kinda wish the game was either trimmed down a bit, or give us a stronger reason to push through the content overload.,7
Damn, and I still look at Deja Vu memes and think, yep, that's an actual meme. XD,5
,6
ena says trans rights!!! damn right gurl <3,1
Actually, I'd say that the only reason why Twoson is bad, alongside Onett, is that you are alone when fighting enemies, and the effects they inflict can be pretty bad. (Some later effects can also be pretty devastating, but you should be able to learn some powerful PSI that will be able to cure them easily, as well as having more PP to do this.) Peaceful Rest can be very annoying because of the Cold effect and extremely fast UFOs, but the payoff is among the best parts of the game. And even then, Twoson is still a nice place to progress in Earthbound.. . But yes, the game only gets better the more you progress, in my opinion. (with a few exceptions here and there, though),4
Thanks. I was thinking that it would have been a nicer idea to let Black Space seep more and more into Headspace the more you progress in time. So for example you would have enemies from black space and/or the abyss suddenly attack you while you're in Sweetheart's castle in a hidden dungeon, or even in the Last Resort.,7

oh aight, coincidence? i think not! but anyway omori was recommended on steam to me recently, and i was considering buying it, it gave me earthbound combat vibes, with more serious undertones, so, without spoilers, like, beyond 1h of play, what's the game about?,7

Among Us in not fun anymore after the summer 2020. I play it since 2018-2019, I'm not sure when i started. And i stopped playing it after a few weeks after it blew up because, as i said, it's became boring and people started developing cheats. Also it's filled with stupid kids.,-11

Sometimes you gotta feel pain to do some real self-introspection. Omori is one of those rare gems in recent years that has actually helped me change my mindset towards guilt, escapism, forgiving oneself and being grateful about life in general. Haven't felt this much brainrot from a game for a long, long time. . . >!yeah but the pain is real!<,359

I started playing and watching Omori made me go through a slight glimpse of reoccurring depression which led me into a spiral of self improvement and care for myself and others.,2
Why is this soo true,2
please no i can’t take another Video Game obsession good god,1
He didn't say change it for the better,1
Same, not sure if at all this point it's making me go through shit, forcing me through shit, or both.,85
This game is really, and when I say really, I mean REALLY powerful. I don't think I've been impacted by a game like this in all my life. I've never cried so many times playing or watching anything throughout all of my past,71
I don't know, I have mixed feelings about that.. . Even though I agree that pain is necessary, and negative feelings can come to positive change, even on media, I wonder: what even is the message the game is trying to convey to us?. . Because, the ending is a bit... Weird.. Well, Omori says the things that Sunny tells himself. Although not all of it is necessarily true, it starts very subjective. Until it comes to the very end, where it is the most objective, undeniable painful truth: >!"you loved her, and you killed her."!< All else before this is subjective, but it's still something he believes in and struggles to not believe in; the only support he has is from the memories of what his friends told him.. . But what is the message here? That you should believe your friends and your memories, your positive thinking?. . .... . Well, to be honest, the longer I analyze it, the more it makes sense, actually.. Well, you yourself are the person that chooses to Continue or Not. . And to continue, you need to remember all of the truth, and remember that some things were good, and some were bad. They grew up together and loved each other, genuinely. Although it is hard, you need to carry on with the help of others, and relying only on yourself is not the best thing to do. And this manifests both in Sunny and in Basil to cope with what happen; Sunny distorts things for it to seem like it never happened, and Basil distorts things to make everything look all good. But when the truth seeps in on the back of your brain, only the bad bits of it will be prevalent. This is why you need friends to remember the good bits.. . . ...or something like that.,60
Makes sense. After all, they've been there for as long as we can remember.,174
Welcome to Meme Space.,117
We can't 😔,12
Lego Skywalker Saga is even more deeper and crazier than Omori,1
Mood,2
*The* most important thing you need to take away from the ending is the idea of forgiving yourself and moving on. Everything else is also important, but secondary (and ambiguous). . . Sunny could not face the truth, so he buried it using the dream world and Omori. But it came back to bite him, because of course, repressing that kind of immense pain will only allow it to fester and eventually consume you. You *have* to confront it and deal with the consequences, then allow yourself to heal.. . I say deal with the consequences, because it is 100% a possibility that after Sunny told his friends everything, they could *not* forgive him. I like to believe they did, like we all want to believe that. There is good reason to think that he was, in fact, forgiven by his peers. However, the opposite is also true. What if the gang can't move on from Sunny's transgression? Omori could be absolutely right about Sunny's friends leaving him. Or *maybe*, Sunny's positive outlook is closer to reality. No one can say for sure, but Sunny needs to be able to forgive himself *regardless* of what his friends' reactions will be. And the first step towards healing is actually facing reality and letting the truth come out. Cause if he doesn't, well, you know what happens. . . Don't forget, Sunny leaves town, too. He has a second chance at making new friends even if Kel, Aubrey and Hero don't forgive him. But if he hasn't forgiven *himself*, then he will never be able to connect to people again and will forever be stuck in his dream world. Or he'll fuckin' yeet himself off a building lol,95

Lmao I can't reply to every comment-- So anyways thanks so much for all the kind comments everyone! You guys might not see this but I'm really happy you guys liked it! I'll be making the real world versions along with the other emotions that aren't seen here too, as well as overworld sprites!,2
What does she attack with?,2
This is SUPER good, you’re so talented!!,2
You forgot that all level 3 emotions have white eyes,2
This is precious. Going to my saves :3 you did such a great job!,2

Here's the link to the original template by GrimyKimu!. . [Template](),1

Please tell me how to draw in dreamspace style? What program are you using?,1
Ppft, of course a low quality post gets the 2nd most upvotes in the sub. Obviously.,1
Wow, this looks incredible!,1
That's amazing! If this was in the real game I wouldn't bat an eye.,1
I love seeing these wish I could make my own tho lol,1
Wish I could make one of my oc :O,1

I require the way you did this,1
Love it :o,1
Nice, feels very authentic.,1
Why does the "MANIC" emotion looks so kinky?,1
my gosh. those facial expressions are perfect. lovely artwork,1
This is just too good, like straight up from the game, amazing!!,1
hey! the manic is not that messer,1
Wow, you really nailed it! Now I want to try it too-,1
how did you make the colors from the original post?,1
I thought this was a mix of dream kel aubery hero and mari,1
Any tips for making something like this myself?,1
Now do afraid...,1
A year late hut how did you replicate the style so perfectly?,1

I can't do commissions right now but in the future, one sheet full of battle emotions might be 10 dollars or something lmao,10
Thank you! :DD,1
Also, where is scared?. Ples do a real world version too!!,6
Yeah the resemblance is funny to me hahah, if I added bangs, she will look even more like a young Mari!,1
Thank ya'! My brother joked about this being a DLC of Omori as a new playable character hahah ^^,2
That's great! I hope you have fun! <3,2
Thank ya'!,1
Thank you! It was fun to reference the original sprites in the game :DD,2
Thanks! <3 <3,1
Thank you! I appreciate it :>,1
aaa thanks! The style of the game is really unique, I mainly referenced Aubrey since she's really expressive heheh,2
Thanks! But sadly I don't really have PayPal yet, maybe in the future! :>,1
[Here]() :>,2
Thank you thank you thank you!! <3 <3 Your comment means a lot to me, I really appreciate it!! I'm happy you noticed the details as well! <3,3
I agree lmao,1
pogchamp,1
I'm sure GrimyKimu is glad to hear that! ^^,1
pFTT-- But these don't even move lmaoo,2
Hahah I based the sprite off of her :>,1
Of course!! The original template is right  [here]() :>,2
You got that right ;)) Also happy cake day! <3,2
Thank you!,1
aaAa-- Thank you thank you!! I didn't know it looked close to the original art style, I tried to replicate the ballpen scribble colors but it didn't go well lmaoo- Have a nice day too! <3,2
With an umbrella probably,2
Thank you! <3,1
Hello! xD I drew this three years ago, but I used FireAlpaca using a pencil brush of some sorts. as for how i drew it, i think i referenced dream aubrey's sprites cuz' she looked the closest to me!,1
what do you mean it looks kinky- it isn't as extreme as omori's though,2
That's what we call Wet Anger where you really wanna inflict pain but there's guilt so you're just frustrated and don't know what to do, which feeds your anger even further until you break down sobbing.,18
Thanks!,3
Please let me know when you’re accepting commissions! I’d def pay more than $10 for a page.,5
Please let me know when u do one soon to i would love to print and put one up on my wall.,1
I'm planning to do the real world versions and afraid ones too! I'm glad you found em cute! :DD,3
My pleasure! and lmao imagine, but the game is so huge already i dont think it could take anymore. its just amazing to see fanart like this and fantasize,3
thats okay lmao,2
thank you so much!!!,2
True, but still,1
[deleted],2
Same,2
everytime i see a purple blurred image while scrolling through reddit home page, i know it’s r/omori,433
3/4 of the game is counted as spoilers lmao,285
I do like how respectful the fandom is with spoilers :),454
Black Mirror - White Christmas (2014),118
I was on this sub the whole time I was playing the game and didn't get spoiled once :) thanks guys <3,67
this looks like weirdcore,54
I still haven't bought the game.... (Waiting for money...),38
why would you visit a sub from a game you didn't finish,17
UHBUHSGHUSHHXUHEBUX LITERALLY EVERY POST JUST IS -,31
I really appreciate it! I'm waiting for the Switch version since my computer can't handle it without overheating.,10
If there are any Unmarked spoilers I will stab that person like-,10
To be fair, some of the twists in the game happen within the first two or three hours.  So about 85% of the game is spoilers.,9
I didn't even start but i'm so confused when looking at the memes sometimes cause my name is mari..,7
Is there a way to toggle viewing spoilers on this subreddit?,7
I got this game on release date but I don't get motivated to play the game a lot and also I'm a dumbass who is constantly going to a guide for help,4
Yeah I got omori a few weeks ago and still have no idea where to go after the >! Hero coming home !< thing so everything is mostly a spoiler for me,4
Fun fact. I view spoiler images despite not playing the actual game,3
at least on reddit they don't do spoilers like on twitter,5
Me RN,3
I just started the game and visiting this sub is like walking in a field of landmines,3
You have been wondering how it ends for as long as you can remember,3
Why is pink hair Aubrey considered a spoiler? The twist was already revealed back in 2014.,2
You have been living here for as long as you can remember.,2
When I started Omori I made the decision that I would not search or look at any Omori related content before I finished the game. I'm so glad I did..,2
This is literally me rn as of writing this comment,1
Is there a way to turn off spoiler screen blurs just for one sub? I wanna look at all the cool memes and art.,1
me!,1
THIS IS EXACTLY ME,1
Are those supposed to be specific images that contain spoilers or just random ones?,1
I think the prologue is the only part that isn't spoilers hahaha,114
I hope it stays like this even if it gets more popular,92
Still is, just finished the game :),1
ARE YOU READY CHILDREN,45
i was unfortunate to even go to new.,13
[removed],32
It’s on sale on Steam right now!!!,12
>!when you are terrified on first night and need memes!<,40
Oh no,3
Do you have a younger brother?,2
[deleted],6
update: it’s still hella respectful! can’t wait to finish the game :),9
can confirm, i always just pirate the game and then buy it if i finished it, i really hate that there are not really demos anymore,29
Yeaaaahh i started it yesterday !!!!. . Omg i already love this game so much TvT,8
Same, I'm really glad I made myself not look up the game at all online until I completed it. (>!ok fine I looked up a guide to defeat humphrey because FUCK that guy!<),3
Update 2: Still is! Also, did you ever finish the game?,7
I am sincerely just waiting to buy it haha. I already have tons of games at home to play... so i don't feel obliged to buy it right now. Moreover, i'm still looking for the switch version and I actually hope for a collector edition from fangamer or Iam8bits or else.,29
Nice!!! I almost have 100 hours in it trying to see everything! There’s so much content i love this game so much!,3
oh ya! it’s quite a roller coaster ,8

We don’t need the 103847th AU in the existence already,160
You've been having a bad time for as long as you can remember,40
Please never say bone space again I did not need that mental image and I am in black space now because of it,5
our attacks would always miss lol,53
I don't know how that would work though.. . In Undertale, you would need to go through several of his attacks and dodge them until he fell asleep so you could hit him. Here in Omori there aren't really any battle systems like this so what could there be?,7
Youve been in the bone zone for as long as you can remember,20
To be fair, all four members can have up to 50...,5
Just a thought, what happens when Aubrey uses her Mood Wrecker on Sans?,97
But we do need this one in particular.,98
error sans,11
Not really? You kill Sans by doing a double, in a 1v1 fight.. . This would be a 4v1.,26
depression him and he will flee,13
A swing that doesn't miss vs. a person that always dodges. . Obviously the universe explodes,133
aaaaaand even if we don't make it now, someone's bound to make it in the future,36
O h.,8
brilliant,11
He will run like a lost soul,2
Unstoppable force Vs immovable object, I get it.,31
Yeah. I wonder who'll take up the role of sans to die a gruesome death at the judgement hall?...,7
for reference in the end you wait until he falls asleep to attack during his special attack. . he wakes up and dodges anyway but then Chara/Frisk (not the player) FUCKING DOUBLES DOWN and he doesn't dodge that. . now you're pitting him against four children,20
More like an Unstoppable Force vs an Uncatchable Entity.,5
Gotta be Snaley. . He might watch you, see how to get strong, realise what he's doing is wrong, and try to stop you,9
But i probabilly wouldn't dodge a third arm coming from a kids mouth after blocking his other 2 arms, and the human attacking again is the undertale equivalent of just growing another arm to attack,6
To be fair, that's just because he didn't expect that.. Here, he very much can.,3
Yeah, well I guess since not all battles end in death in OMORI hopefully sans would live afterwards lol,3
cursed,2
JUST MARI  . JUST MARI  . JUST MARI  . JUST MARI,621

OMORI LOOKS SO FUNNY (≧▽≦),97
Yoo I love this!. . Shame Mari didnt get to be in the mirror tho : ( We kinda left her hanging, you know?,91
"Aubrey, why do we have to wear these outfits again?". . . "Shut up! The internet will get it!",58
Hey why is Sayori there, she should be hanging out with Mari,43
>!"You killed Sayori. She loved you and you killed her."!<  . >!"Yuri loved you and you broke her."!<  . >!"Natsuki loved you and you deleted her."!<  . >!"Protag loved you and you erased him."!<  . >!"Player loved you and you drove them to delete you."!<,17
this is perfect hahaha,13
LESS GOOO!! cool art!! it looks so much like official art it took me a few to realize lol,10
Kel as Sayori just looks great, idk why.,8
This just made my day ^.^ thank you!,9
the more i look in these comments, the more these games share in common-. . also i now wanna see art of these two character groups interacting-,7
no no no no no no no... i don't want Aubrey to disappear and Kel to ##### himself they are my favourite 2 of the group. it would be a cool crossover tho.,6
I love this lol. As soon as I found out omori existed it immediately reminded me of a crossover between DDLC and Undertale,3
Everyday, I imagine the future when You can die alone 🎶,4
My favorite games all in one. . \*downloads image\*,3
oh jesus,3
Every day-  **falls from the too of the hospital!!,3
the two simultaneously worst and best psychological horror games,3
Nice, now i have the opportunity to say that Spaces In-Between and I Still Love You share something in common. . Also, Who will be Basil and Mari?,3
Twice the cast, and quadruple the ptsd,3
The best thing about this is how >!omori LITERALLY HAS THE ERASE ABILITY IN THE FINAL FIGHT!<,3
I DONT LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING,2
YOOO THATS SO GOOD,2
IT FITS??,2
So Dream Natsuki love Dream Monika, and real Monika loves real Natsuki. And real Natsuki is a delinquent.,2
doki doki music club,2
Raion the amount of unexplainable joy your art gives me 👌,2
this is actually really good,2
I would think that Sayori would be Mari in this scenario.. . I'm sad now.,2
Thank you raion  . Youve always been one of my favorite ddlc artists  . and you crossed it with one of my othyer favorite games  . thank you,2
*I needed this.*,2
All of my ptsd in one image, thanks mate,2
I fucking love it,2
basil?,1
Who's MARI and BASIL then ?,1
Natsuki as Aubrey pretty much accurate,1
Kel as Sayori... Now that is scary,1
wheres the fucked up part,1
Wait. . But what is Monika's counterpart in the real world?,1
If only there was a few more characters in DDLC.,1
Ah!! I love this!,1
Sayori is so cute wth,1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,1
I LOVE THIS,1
I played both of these games for the first time one after the other. Life protip: do not do that,1
OMONI,1
They're basically the same game. Or, they have similar styles and vaguely similar characters at the least.. . Same font, different words.,1
They are in order of largest to smallest in height, and  biggest to smallest in breasts,1
Same character arc,1
Basil =?,1
this fits too well,1
nah nah nah mari is sayori,1
An interaction between Omori and Monika would be **quite** interesting.,1
NONONONONO. . . MC AS HERO AND YURI AS BAGEK🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,1

No violins allowed,98

And Natsuki is the hot-headed one, sayori is the “cheerful,” bubbly one, while Yuri is the mature one, just like hero. Very well done,141
They want another person and will do anything to get them,6
PIANO!. . **CRASH**. . WHO’S IDEA WAS THIS!,44
2 psychological game merge, nice,67
Basil as MC: ***dashing over carrying Mari***. . “Alright, I may have voluntold Mari into joining you guys, can I go home now?”. . Monika: “…who are you?”,46
you did not-,34
Oh my god XD,12
my man whit the joke,7
**WHY DID YOU SAY THAT**,1
Oh no no no not here too,1
Kel: ***galactic THONK***. . …. . “Oh it’s DDLC, right?”. . Aubrey: “Ye.”,4
you sneaky person,11
Pizza burgers something cut stab delete,3
You know Monika is thinking it when she has a change of heart, but we know now that extreme guilt isn’t any better than a total lack of remorse!,2
Yes!,1
I might want, to close my eyes, so i can dream more 🎶,1
You’re right!!!,1
Monika is a perfectionist who wants things her way!,1
What if Sayori killed MC by accident instead?. . . Lile Sayori takes Sunny’s role while MC takes Mari’s role.. . After all, MC is clearly Sayori’s Best Friend.,1
Wait does this count as sexual?,1
Kel.,137
Omori,22

Bruh shoutout to SOMETING for stopping BASIL from spoiling the twist.,400
>!Basil: "In that case, we need to do whatever it takes to cover up the spoilers... **whatever it takes**"!<,258
Omori: And you know what happens to those who spoil things don't you basil. . Basil: Wai-. . Omori: THAT'S RIGHT, HELL!. . Basil: ***A-***,183
>!That’s it, to Blackspace you go!<,99
This scene made me think >! Mari would turn out to be a murderer and attack everyone or something, so I was super wary of her my first time through :D I guess I've played too many RPGmaker horror games with twist villains hah !<,75
Thanks bro, leave it to twitter to spoil the rest,12
Mf wanted to ruin the game so Omori went full dictator censorship and blacked everything,12
MARI WHAT?! MARI IS WHAT!?,3
New Game Plus where Omori just goes "yeah I already knew that. Now come on it's time to grind for cans.",493

>!Join Abbi!<,24
Me too, I either thought >!Mari was going to try and kill Omori and his friends, or Basil would idk, do something since they felt both eerie. !<,65
“Restart anew with all your trauma!”. . edit: did I just reply to an ancient comment,93
You can directly go to Blackspace as if nothing happened,2
Kel and Aubrey constantly forget their lines, Hero is trying (not succeeding) in helping them, Sunny is standing idly and just watching Kel and Aubrey argue, Basil is the person behind the camera and can be seen fiddling with the settings of it, Mari is the director and the hooligang is the supporting cast. . . They all don't know what they're doing, Mari and Hero are the only responsible ones.. . (side note: kinda good fanfic idea, lol.),17
Aubrey: "...Is that why you were getting so worked up, Basil?". . Kel: "Ohhhh... so THAT'S what you were trying to tell us!". . Hero: "I was meaning to tell you guys about this later... but I guess this works too.",65

I guess Polly is my favorite character now,738
Welp, I expected Polly to be in her 40s to 50s. I guess I was far off... to be honest, something in her appearance kind of makes me feel that she's a combination of Mari and Basil,546
No wonder Kel asks for her number,277
who needs Sunny when you’ve got her?,270
All the fan art and my headcanon was pretty close. Very cool.. . Hope omocat makes more art of characters or maybe even au's and stuff one day,130
Mommy- i mean mommy- i mean,328
Holy shit the thirst comments here. People need water so badly,79
I wish I was basil,207

does she want a cracker,48
I'm jealous of her fashion,32

Reminds me of Niko's mom tbh,7
Mommy? Sorry.,6
Whne when she,4
Whoaa she's so pretty, who would've thought?,6
Who is Polly?,6
she adorable :),5
POLLY CONTENT?!?!?!?. . Also I like how the comments are people finally being able to simp for a Real World character other than Hero lmao,5
don't simp for polly don't simp for polly don't simp for polly don't,5
my dick is confused,5
Mommy? Sorry,4
Lucky Basil,6
Anyone who says basil is lucky, is a creep for thinking so. She's clearly like a mother figure to basil.,7
at some point omocat is gonna start just drawing lewd art and the mods are gonna have a choice to make,9
*"Oh no, she's hot!"*,7
This is exactly how I expected her to look like!!!. She looks so sweet!,3
She is young, told ya guys, she is like 22,3
Aw, what a cute design.,3
Wtf I love Polly now???,3
God damn basil,3
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.,10
Major ara ara vibes,7
Imma be the weird one and say, she'd be an excellent soft dom,5
Always knew she was a bombshell,2
Is it bad that she looked like kel for a second.,2
It solidifies a best character when the creator makes more art of them in their honor.,2
Makel,2
kinda reminds me of my girlfriend a bit,2
*starts gay panicking*,2
why do i kinda look like her,2
if you flip the picture upside down it becomes an owo,2
She’s absolutely gorgeous!,2
I’m crying over her,2
Oh she's so pretty,2
She's nice ,2
I feel she could have been a bit more important . . Espically with her trying to be kind to Basil despite all he's been through,2

Ive always thought she was in her 20s,347
"a combination of mari and basil". . . Barry.. . Edit: cry about it,93
I expected her to be middle aged too, but part of that is because she looks similar to my aunt polly, who is a nice middle aged lady.,67
If we go by the draft designs Omocat had for the Faraway characters, Polly was shown to be conceptualized as somewhere around 22-30.  Whether this still applies to Polly in the final game or not is unconfirmed.,31
I mean when you meet her, there's some dialogues about her being pretty young I think.,14
more like a combination of mari and kel,6
I always need Sunny.,131
Omocat pretty regularly posts group shots of the whole gang Completely and Totally Fine and just hanging out (Though it's usually for merch deals) so they at least seem to support a no-trauma AU lol,56
This is a Starbucks sir,148

Very poor choice of words.,76
Bruh,10
im hoping you mean this as in she looks like she would be a good mom (considering his parents are nowhere to be seen at any point in the game in any capacity) and not anything bad,18
"Its not about if she has kids or not snake. Its about milf energy.". . "Milf energy huh...milf energy",48
Nah she wants water to put out the blowtorch,15
Ikr her clothes and color choice id the perfect mix of sexy/attractive but also judt beautiful and cute.. . Goes well with her brown hair and darker skin as well,23
Hey i just ordered some pizza to Polly,31
they look a little bit like kel for some reason idk if that’s just me,7
Thank goodness basils house is one story,7
And maybe if he was 10 years older,78
If Basil wasn't gay as fuck, \^and in a constant state of pain\^ he'd be the luckiest bastard in the world. . Ftfy,11

She's basil caretaker or you know adoptive mom,4
. . I didn't remember her either.,3
:D,1
Excuse me. Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.... Mommy?,7
I never knew kel looked so good in drag LMAO,5
Shut up Kel,85
Sorry Kel but I got you burger 🍔,36
Same idk how one would assume her to be 40 or 50.. . She always seemed to be a young adult in her twenties from what she says and how she looks plus the official character draft shows her being a young adult.,161
She IS 20 - 28.. There is a chart showing everyone's age,49
speaking like a true femboy. . jk. . but ya know,73
I have seen a few but id love more and also see more defined art of characters like Mincy ir blur hait girl etc.. . Hell if omocat is bored give me omari or hiki kel art to spread the pain,25
That almost sounds like one of those ridiculous titles for a light novel.,65
Very worth it,37

Yeah, kel, what did you even do, you hecking burgr boy,63
B-but kel,21
If you're not familiar with the character charts + other dev notes (which I'm sure is the case for a lot of people), it's not really that strange. Polly's broadly portrayed as a responsible, (likely) professional caretaker fo Basil and his grandmother, which has a rather broad age range (late 20s to before retirement age). I can see how people would interpret her motherly concerns about Basil to be her being significantly older.,102
oh yeah,9
Where is that chart may I ask?,7
Fuckin chad pfp, you even play fuckin twewy, literally the highest sigma,17
,5
thats a better interpretation,10
Yeah that would prob be condiderd workplace harrasment.. . Obvs if she is fine with it itw okay i guess...aside from the whole basil being underage and prob 10 to 14 years her junior kek.. . But woof woof bark bark,17
That's the thing, she doesn't give off a professional aura. She looks like she knows how to do the job but is awkward doing anything out of it. Her dialogue mostly consists of not understanding Basil's problems and worrying over how to do so, like... a young adult. Also the way she speaks sounds more mature than a teenager yet not quite how an old woman would. Idk man she screamed 20s hardworking woman to me.,56
Pretty sure it is in the bottom of the wiki of Polly where it shows everyones age and they are like next to each other too so you can see their height and all,17
Good bot,3
Thanks!,8
You are welcome,4

ooo what a steal, how could I possibly pass up a deal like that?,201
This is a scam, you can’t give me what I already have,114

Depressed yes, poor? A harder yes,70
Seems about right, but instead of the depression all I got was chest pain.,34

I just wanted to ask though, are those ramen noodles in the stomach or something more sinister?,8
It’s the good depression though. You’re emotionally devastated and simultaneously loving how it had this effect on you (coming from someone currently going through it),5
Now I had my interested peaked with that great deal,5
win. absolute win,3
You receive, ENHANCED depression,3
shouldnt have played blind,2
Haha jokes on you, already had it.  Checkmate,2
Nah we literally all spend $20 for depression. It’s reverse therapy,2
Jawsome!,2
i accept,2
na i got STRESSED OUT (it will all be okay),2
I mean, I think omocat go through that too while making the game,1
Oh. So you guys didnt knew?. Omocat was working for me (read the nick). . So yes,. We gave u depression,. Now. . The money,. Hand me over. NOW,1
sounds like a good deal,sign me in.,1
Yay I got free stuff I got a unhealthy addiction, hours of my life having fun playing a game over and over getting all endings, hour opon hours looking at Reddit groups and fan art, on less tears to shed later cause I miss my old friends and looking at basils photo album makes me remember time I had with my old friends,1
So that’s my depression came from I was wondering why it was depress after this game,1
It’s only fair.,1
Equivalent exchange, if you will.,1
mad lad!,57
I diagnose you with double depression,58
I wanted to see whether my depression adds or multiplies. Results still inconclusive.,14
I think it's supposed to be a table.,1
Make that triple,28
Could be yarn too.,2
Wow, I bet omocat must be really proud making the image so interpretative.,1
Who knows. I've been told to think outside of a box I've never been in.,2
Just realized how anticlimactic the fights probably looked,887
Yeah, this absolutely was me trying to win that fight without using the knife.. . >!Turns out it doesn't actually matter beyond getting a tiny bit of extra dialog, but it still made me feel accomplished.!<,338
:2471:why won't you die. . :2467:um plasters i guess. . :2474:,548
I want to see an MGR meme where Aubrey repeatedly punches Kel,197
I actually stabbed her immediately,187
surprised no one else in game mentioned that Aubrey just whacks Kel with a nailbat for 7 minutes straight twice, yet he takes it like a champ what a hero ,94
Reminds me of the time >!before facing Mr Jawsum Kel was just whistling and then HEADSPACE Aubrey just full on punches him lol!<,92
I actually beat THE HOOLIGANS using this strat. Felt good.. . "Bandaids, son. SUNNY applies them in response to physical trauma.",37
,20
That baseball bat could seriously injure someone.,17
Kel being a pinata,14
I just think in the song Vs. Susie while fighting her,15
"These bandages aren't helping my blunt force trauma, SUNNY, but thanks for your consideration!". . "",14
Sunny: Damn, this isn't funny.,12
How is Kel needing bandages on his clothes?!,11
 Buying food b/c you haven't eaten anything good in like a month. .  Buying a box of bandages to help your friend beat up neighborhood bullies with a basketball,10
I imagine it the real world fights like how meet the medic went, with sunny healing kel until he manages to fill the ubercharge,8
Wait till Sunny pulls out the pepper spray on Aubrey,4
If he brought pizza Kel would be invincible,3
kel is unstoppable ,4
,4
Quite accurate ngl,3
is that how you do it, i just spam calm down,3
"Kel I spent way too much money on these bandages please dodge attacks",2
[deleted],-14
Pretty much,1
Heh,1
Yeah that's really realistic,1
True though,1
I find funny how Sunny unlike Omori is a support character more than a DPS character,1
Where is the source?,1
Ahh very accurate,1
Exactly how it goes,1
Aubrey hates kel more for some reason,1
this is how you beat THE HOLLAGANS whitout PEPPER SPRAY, litterly use KEL ENCOURAGE and than just make KEL spam GAURD since they always taget KEL over SUNNY and than SUNNY slowly attaks while ocasionaly trowing a bandage at KEL,1
medic gaming ,1
I wish they made it more realistic in the game, Kel is bigger and taller than Aubrey, he can knock her out with a few punches.,1
,1
i always giggle imagining kel throwing his basketball at the hooligans, then running after it before the next round,664
half the omori fanbase: omg these kids were beating the shit out of each other how awful. . the other half: lol have you seen teenagers fight? they're all babies,94
I mean this fight in particular was really just Aubrey wailing on you with a bat while you struggle to defend yourself,34
Kel really had to take that knife huh?,34
Until Sunny and Aubrey use real weapons on each other. Like that would be kinda crazy seeing kids stabbing each other and swinging bats with nails.,17
I mean it is supposed to that way. These are REAL fights, and most of the fights irl are just some people hitting each other with optinal stabing and shooting,2
Yeah, instead of Aubrey learning that Sunny is Brittish, she backs off before anything can happen because she notices Sunny has a knoife,242
NANOMACHINES SON,175
,15
,1
yes lmao,46
Everybody gansta till they get shanked.,112
,23
Wait didn’t everyone,6
Based,3
tbf I think the dialog says some crap like "uses brute force on kel" which could refer to anything not just the blatantly obviously spiked bat which could obviously one-tap any foe (also called "murder"),47
I'm sure Aubrey never hits anyone with a bat there (in 3 days left at least, I know there's that quest on one day left). At the end, you can even see in the description that her bat is more dangerous than a steak knife. The bat is more of a threat or to just look intimidating, than the actually used weapon.,13
> what a hero. . uhhh that's his brother,13
Loved that part lmao,5
Loved that part,1
Aubrey eats chalk confirmed,10
His clothes ripped, probably,11
,22
No. Just no.,6
I think Aubrey is frickin buff and kel is somewhat normal, but even if what you're saying is true Aubrey's nail bat can kill anyone instantly, she just doesn't use it because she's a good person (the weapon description calls it more dangerous than a steak knife),1
It's weird to think Kim was getting a fucking basketball thrown at her face by Kel and her glasses didn't break.... . This makes me wonder just how little strength Kel was using to throw his ball,like everyone is super delicate and he doesn't want to hurt them.,360
nah kel throws it perfectly so that it hits it's target and then lands back to him,57
I always imagined it bouncing back towards him.,26
Or it fucking bounces back into his hand like it’s a yo-yo and everyone is terrified of how that even works,10
FOR REAL. the whole time I was like "these guys are bunch of losers oh my god",1
Not even. Not in either of her fights does she actually use the bat against you. The most damaging attack she has is just headbutting you.. . You can see in her fights on her turn what she does and the only other thing she does besides headbutting you is spitting in your shoes and 'attacking' which has more so a punching animation than a swinging animation.. . >!I feel that if Aubrey did start using her bat Kel and Sunny would have called the fight as well as the adults in the church for her beating people with a baseball bat. just like Aubrey does what she'd knifed.!<,43
Really kel why take the knife? No wonder people hated him,5
Holy nostalgia throwback, didn't expect a response to my 3y old comment, thanks!,3
Good thing Sunny isn't All American^TM. That would open up a whole new ending.,120
THEY HARDEN IN RESPONCE TO PHYSICAL TRAUMA,92
*zooms in,4
,1
And sunny in the background continuously giving kel plaster,70
I laughed so fucking hard when the battle immediately ended and she was like “DID YOU JUST STAB ME” i wasn’t expecting it,165
😎,2
Nope. Some people just didn’t have sunny attack and kept going,5
Yeah, given her heaviest hitting attack is a headbutt, the implication seems to be that she just kinda carries the bat around to look scary and doesn't use it on people. Further supported by her having the skill Home Run in the RW when she joins the party, which has the chance to just instantly defeat someone, so clearly the game recognizes that the bat will absolutely wreck someone.,48
When the light is going low,6
,12
What did he say?!?!?,1
kel has unfathomable strength and had to go easy on everyone so he didn't obliterate them. . proof: kel nuke in headspace,288
For the record this has happened multiple times to me and my glasses werent even scratcheddjdjdje,38
Kel is Steve Rogers of basketball,27
I would agree with you if not for the fact the normal punching animation used by Sunny and Hero is different from hers, plus her attack animation is literally the same as her HS ones, which are *swinging motions* because she still uses a **bat**.. . Again, it doesn't explain how it hurts less than a headbutt like you said...,6
DOOMori,71
Now I’m just reminded of Moria’s Trauma from Resident Evil Revelations 2. . >!Moira’s police dad leaves the weapon cabinet not locked properly and Moira decides to play with his revolver with her younger sister nearby!< , literally less then a year after her dad sells out his coworkers to save his kids,7
YOU CAN'T HURT ME JACK,65
You know what ELSE,25
the robot dog, instead of having a cool sword,. . has emotional trauma instead.. . it's a flail >!resembling Mari and jumprope!<,13
"Ew",4
lmfao I had forgotten that I picked up the knife, it didn't register until it ended that it was the weapon equipped,82
I was so used to headspace I was just like "attack", and then the battle ended and I was thinking "wait what, what ha-" and then Aubrey got upset and I was like "ooooohhhhhhh yeeeeaaaahhhh, knives in the real world hurt.". . And then Sunny goes to take it and I was like "No wait, I didn't mean to- all right, no, yeah, you're right. Id prolly react the same way...",41
Oh ,5
"AUBREY's weapon of choice. More dangerous than a STEAK KNIFE.",13
And the shadows start to grow,3
I dunno.. IT was like over 2 years ago,1
>!If Headspace is based off real life, then does that mean Sunny witnessed Kel nuke IRL?!<,208
If he throws his ball downwards, the shockwave will be enough to send everyone flying towards Hocotate,12
Rip and tear starts playing in the background,27
wait so if someone kicks you in the balls you get hard,20
,5
I love how Omori does that, because the knife is absolutely fine in headspace and no one says a thing so you get conditioned to it. Sunny stabs Aubrey because he is also conditioned to headspace after not interacting with real human people in four years. He forgot stabbing is bad,127
I DID remember about the knife and I was like "What the fuck I don't wanna stab her holy shit!". . (I did, eventually, stab her though, but not until my health was so low I could spin it in my head as self defense),14
LMFAOO,8
Yeah, and yet no one comments on her using it, despite that. Common sense thus entails it doesn't end up getting used.,10
And the places that you know,2
You know, back in the day there was another town close to faraway town,but then the Kel incident happen and it disappeared for the map.. . It was the Kel nuke.,168
And also, that was 4 years ago. Kel is likely even stronger now.,8
Omori what did I tell you earlier...,17
,4
I actually also forgot stabbing was bad after spending so much time in headspace and audibly gasped when that happened lmao . . Like i was so on autopilot "yeah sure, we solve problems by fighting" mode that it was a necessary push back to reality. I was low key really stunned like "wait. Did i really stab her? I didn't mean to-.. What? Oh no" . . Great timing in terms of game design lmao also appreciate kel stepping in immediately after,68
He forgor also spoilers,7
Seem like fantasy,2
Kel as a healthy non-physically neglected athlete is the strongest fighter in faraway and is only holding himself back by using a ball.,76
Kel probably pulled an [omni man move](),13
Dear lord....,3
to be honest my ass wasnt listening ,16
SAME LOL! The game design is so well done,20
I did the same exact thing I forgot I had the knife. I stabbed her and I felt horrible for it,1

[inside you there are two wolves](),509
I’m not obsessed but think Brazil is pretty cool. 🇧🇷,206
People redeem Aubrey and sunny for what they did, but apparently basil’s one action was too much, why not forgive all?. . . . Except for Rosa, fuck Rosa,148
I don't understand hatred for any character.. . >!Except Hot Diggity Dog. Fuck him.!<,206
[deleted],813
Sweetheart deserves the hate instead. Wanted to tear the bitch apart every time she was onscreen.,323
Omori fans either want to gang up with Aubrey and punt Basil, or they baby him so much it's annoying and just makes people hate Basil more,303
I've got the feeling that this community is devolving and we must evacuate immediately. . Update: I'm jumping ship, see you never,197
But he's the best character! He even has a flower in his hair, what more do people want!?!?,53
These days, I unironically don't trust people who hate any of the game's characters. I've seen people say he's badly-written (disagree), has no screentime (okay fair), annoying (the fuck), drags the group down (I mean, Aubrey just kinda joins you on the last day without doing much of anything to atone for her crimes - and I think Basil suffers so much he makes up for it anyway.) or a psychopath because he decided to hang the corpse and let his friends fall apart. To that last point, I say:. . [. . That aside, I think it's just hypocritical all-around to adore one character and hate another (I say, having hated Aubrey early on in my time in the fandom). It's just like... damn, brother, you have no reading comprehension! That's great to know, I guess.. . I kind of want to venture further into these comments and see people's deranged takes, but I'm too tired and not masochistic enough to do so.,34
I don’t hate him, but I don’t obsess over him. He’s one of my lesser liked characters in the cast but I have a lot more love for the other characters. I like him, but don’t adore him.,71
I've seen some people misinterpret Basil as something he doesn't want to be, a killer. Examples are that one video which is a MGR meme compilation on YouTube, the part where Armstrong repeatedly punches Basil. The others even agreed because someone said he killed someone, even if they didn't play the game. But if they played the game, they took that misinterpretation too far. That's what I find slightly annoying, they don't even know what Basil's been through. He lost almost everything, and they just agree that Basil is a killer and he deserves to be punched a lot. How could they know what was Basil's state of mind? A very while back, I was using Reddit in a browser, then came here after 8 months to monitor most of the comments relating with Basil. I just observe and I won't interfere. . . Another comment here in this post said if those kinds of people were Basil, they couldn't bear what he's been through.. . I'm just 50/50 with Basil. I don't hate him and I don't really like him either, but this is getting ridiculous. I just have sympathy for Basil, that's all.,67
>!I like Basil as a character, and I don’t want to hurt him.. Not because he’s my favorite, but because he isn’t.. . People commonly like seeing their favorite characters hurt, and same with me.. Sorry Sunny, into the blender you go.!<,29
Not trying to hate on Aubrey or anything, but I feel like the people who hate Basil and defend Aubrey are hypocrites. Aubrey deals with her trauma by joining a gang and then treats the guy who's sister died like she's the only one whose hurting? Pushing Basil into a lake when she didn't know the whole story? She got better (obviously) and said sorry (she's a good person deep down and obviously had no where else to turn to with an absent father and distant mother), but she still did things wrongs though to a lesser extent, and so did Sunny and Basil. The only people who are 100% innocent here are Kel and Hero. Again, NOT HATING ON MY PINK-HAIRED FAVORITE, but Basil hate is so disproportionate in terms of "whose the worst". I really think the fandom is becoming something intolerable and honestly, it was expected considering what happened with Undertale.,141
i think basil is a pretty cool fella,19
As a random hero fan I also thought it was a joke LOL,19
I have a neutral opinion on Basil. Yeah, >!covering Mari’s death as a suicide!< was pretty fucked up, but he paid the price. In the >!Basil boss fight, Basil’s something eating him is literally his guilt eating him alive.!< His grandma, friends and parents all left him while he tried to reassure himself that everything was okay, being a prime example of toxic positivity. Not to mention one of his old friends Aubrey started to bully him and gathered other kids to bully him too. He went through so much. He should 100% be held accountable for >!hanging Mari!< but he shouldn’t be shit on, or babied either.,40
basil is my favorite character leave him alone,15
Basil is probably my least favorite out of the main squad (mostly because we get to see Hero, Kel, and Aubrey a lot more), but I still love him to pieces.,26
Exactly like he’s ”just” a boy who’s kind, likes flowers and photography and has severe anxiety/trauma. I understand if you don’t love him or smth but hating him? What?? . . >!They’re all victims of the trauma, Mari’s death wasn’t his fault. And the fact that he knew what hanging was ’should’ just make you feel even more bad for him if anything.. If that’s why you’d dislike him.!<,13
Neutral gang rise up,22
I don't really hate him, but just don't get why he did what he did. He owes one heck of an explanation (and really needs therapy) that's for sure.,41
I just think he’s fine, but his character just feels not well written near the conclusion,11
Not gonna lie, i've grown to love every omori character unconditionally by the end of the game. Don't know why everyone would hate basil, he's my favorite plant boy ,27
,9
I love Basil, his personality and hobbies/likes really hit home. When I played the game I was shocked on how similar I acted like him.. . I left the game with confliting thoughts, though. I can't help but think what he did was messed up, but he did what he thought was right in that moment, he panicked. A lot of people also forget that they were 12 at the time. The fanbase acts like Basil is a criminal, but somehow are able to forgive what Sunny did to Mari, if we see things black or white and nothing grey, we are being messed up ourselves. There were circunstances and their age and trauma. They are not criminals, both of them.. . Also, I don't like Aubrey, I ended the game not fond of her because she is a bully, I got bullied myself. And who the hell carries a bat with nails on their daily lives??? Hello??? People??? . . Hero is a sweet boy and Kel deserves everything good in this world. I love Kel.. . Edit:grammar.,16
he is literally to the point of committing suicide over his guilt and people think that he should suffer more wtf,8
People ain’t got no empathy. Basil deserves just as much forgiveness as Sunny or the point of the game is missed.,26
[deleted],23
,13
Why do people hate him? He just did what he thought would protect his best friend which backfired, what about that makes people hate him?,13
DON'T DISRESPECT MY BOI BAGEL!!!,26
The Basil hate makes me sad. I really like him because he's a fascinating character to me. Sure he's no saint, but if he only did good things, he'd be boring as hell.,11
I'm gonna lay my own thoughts on the subject.. . Basil is a very thought-out character and obviously has lots of character development, mainly in >!Real world and BLACKSPACE !<he's a tragic character who >!the death of Mari on accident even though he didn't actually want to witness it, going from shocked to wanting to frame it as a suicide to save Sunny from going to prison . !<What a lot of people forget he's just a guy who did something out of cowardice and spite to save his Best Friend.. . Basil is truly a magnificent character the way he's portrayed, this game is about anger, guilt and forgiveness but he never experienced HIS happy ending >!unless you get the Secret Ending/True Ending  !<his friends were like family to me and the feeling of being alone made him sick and twisted in the head, whether he did the bad thing, he has some righteousness to it, even though it was BAD.. . He's ultimately the one who suffers the most because >!while Sunny caused Mari's death, from her perfectionism and pushing Sunny causing his hands to start bleeding thanks to being in the recital in BLACKSPACE he is the main reason it all happened !<and Basil just... >!saw it even without knowledge of the argument, I bet he never knew what actually happened thanks to Sunny telling the truth !<.. . As I said it's mainly about Basil and his way to forgive himself for the selfishness and lies to put on others for years, Sunny sure did a part but wasn't in the mindset to understand the situation. Basil is definitely hated but for many reasons, whether you think he is the worst character is up to you but the way I see it he's just morally faulted by his own actions... which were not entirely his fault, THEY WERE 12!. . &#x200B;. . Anyway thanks for coming,5
Im an avid basil hater and avid basil lover,10
half of the omori discord server hates basil, once, they had like 2 rants about how much they hated him in a day,5
not hate but I just think he's problematic as fuck, . . what kind of 9 yr old thinks of hanging the body on a tree when they see their friend killed someone. . and that someone is someone that is so important to both,3
I actually hate fanon basil. . Canon basil is fine,4
how could you hate basil,4
I actually went into the game knowing the big twist at the end, but even then I still really cared about him- followed Stranger at ever opportunity, never hesitated on the various >!"Do you want to save Basil"!< prompts, felt genuinely horrible about all of his >!black space scenes, knocked on his door like 10 times on the final night.!<. . Big spoilers ahead. . >!I think what people don't understand is that kids at the age he and Sunny were during Mari's fall can't fully understand the consequences of something as huge as accidentally killing a person, and end up making worse decisions because the simple idea of being implicated in that is enough to make them want to completely avoid it, not to mention the potential that it could lead to losing friends, which, as anyone will tell you, is often a child's worst fear. I feel there's also an element of his image of Sunny there, I got the impression that he put him up on a super high pedestal and couldn't cope with that image being tarnished by Sunny's outburst, so came up with a lie he could tell himself to keep seeing his very best friend as perfect.!<. . . I've more to say on this but I think I've gone on long enough for now, I mean, this is a meme ffs. . Edit: Had to repost comment because I didn't properly spoiler tag,4
How tf do people see Basil as annoying when Kel exists?? /hj. . Seriously though I love Basil so much, it's nice to have a character to relate to <3,17
[removed],15
He's just so puntable,31
[deleted],5
It's because he's. . 1. A child.. 2. Has personal flaws.. . Characters aren't allowed to be young and make mistakes.,6
everytime I see somone list their reasons for hating Basil I get the feeling that they really were not paying attention to the game whatsoever,8
I don't trust ppl who don't like Basil tbh [/j but not really]. . And belive it the reason for it has nothing to do with the game or fandom.,3
I used to hate him,3
 why do ppl find him annoying tho,3
I don’t hate him but I don’t like him either. Mostly that’s because I felt like he was barely in the game. He didn’t go on any of the adventures or run around town with us so I’m like “eh.”,3
,3
I don't hate Basil. I just hate that Basil doesn't love himself. It hurts to see traits that I see in myself in him as well.,3
I feel like these people are hyperfocusing on basil's sins to downplay sunny in a sorta denial. (Not unlike basil attributing sunnys sins to "something"). . Same thing with people that characterize mari as a high strung nag; taking one scene and making that define how they see the characters. Albiet it's a very emotional scene so that can warp perceptions,3
How could anyone hate bagel. . ,3
I like Basil. You might like r/Basilcult,7
Don’t do my man basil like that, he’s one of my top 3 favourites,7
i mean, he could've called an ambulance but NOOOOO, we had to frame it as suicide,5
People: omg babies yell and whine crazy shit, but still love them. . Danganronpa fans: OmG mikan and Hiyoko are whiney and are best girls  . . . people with Basil: ***i want to beat the living shit out of him if he doesn't stfu***,5
i fucking love basil,6
I don't hate basil, he's just an alpha male, lucky enough to have a friend group of sigma males (and one sigma female), he's not a beta male, he's just not a sigma male either,6
I mean…I like Basil :),2
No way, he's a sweet boy that's been through a lot ,2

Even i thought they hqted him for joke but now i always see pepol that want to set him on fire like ,2
I'd take and receive bullets for him. I'd die for him, and you know what? In my lowest point, I'd live for him. He gives me so much joy. That pixel blondie guy with a flower. Why does he even have a flower? I don't know. He is so cute. I love him.,2
I don’t hate the guy but I definitely don’t like him. Like a lot of the things wrong w his character I can chalk up to him being a traumatized child but that doesn’t necessarily make it better.,2
How can you hate Basil?,2
I wish there would be a bonus dlc to play on basil’s life and what went on in his life so we could form a more rounded opinion rather than assuming most of everything.,2

How can you hate basil,2
It *is* a joke, some people just make it without realizing that. ,2
. . tell those fuckers name,2
What?! Bro I f\*\*kin love BAsil because hes that on the outside obnoxiously happy person but while helping everyone else he never has anyone to help him. I like Basil because I can relate and connect to him so much. Everyone left him and yett he continued to care because wanted to hold on to the good times. Wanted people to be happy but was never able to get happiness in return. He did so many things rong, but he had everyone depending on him to bringe them together. To help them- the things he did was the only way he was able to hold on to everyone. I think hes an amazing chairicter Personally  (well that and all the other chairicters cause there all epic),7

I like him,2
Id like to know why people hate him? I more so like headspace Basil then real world since yk. I’m pretty sure he’s the one who came up with the idea to hang her. If anyone has their reasons please tell?. (If anyone can tell me how to mark spoilers in a comment pls tell me),2
You hate basil because of a joke. I hate him because he's a little bitch boy who can't swim. We are not the same,2
I am part of the team that doesn't really like Basil. What he's like in headspace or his relation to >!Mari's staged suicide!< has little to nothing to do with it.. . I genuinely don't like how his personality is, even though it's built well. He comes off as manipulative most of times to me. I don't know, it's a gut feeling. If you asked me a specific event I would pinpoint every segment >!between him and Aubrey. We always see him as the bullied guy to save from the bully but he was the one that scribbled every photo with Mari. Now I don't remember how Aubrey got it, if she stole it or was tossed out, but every single scene is just a big misunderstanding (and whatever Kel does, it doesn't help).!<. . It doesn't end here. >!The scene where Sunny goes away leaving him in his room. Yeah he's spiraling but guilt tripping someone into staying with you? Hell nah. And Sunny rightfully with his character goes away. I don't like clingy people and Basil is a big one.!<. . In the end, I wouldn't probably like someone like Basil irl so I don't like him as a character.,2
I understand that some ppl find him annoying but thinking he's a psycho is just too much, there's also the fact that for some reason omocat made basil be such a vague character, everyone in the main group has backstory and even if she doesn't tell us everything abt them still we at least get to know something abt these characters, with basil this didn't happen, we know too little abt him and the story is told to us based on sunnys views of the events so there's a big possibility basil is a better person than we know but we just don't get to see that. We only see sunnys side of the story and how he felt guilty, we know the thing also affected basil but we don't get to see what happened to him or how he really felt abt everything that happened and while sunny shutdown himself and became isolated from everyone Basil is the one that needed to deal with the social consequences of >!mari's death, he had to face everyone abandoning him + getting bullied in a daily basis by aubrey and her gang, mf doesn't have present parents, his grandma is dying, the only person he could trust is polly but he seems to have trust issues with adults so ofc he doesn't trust her.!<. . I really think omori needs a dlc focusing on Basil between these 4 years since the incident, bc his character feels kinda wasted, he's so important to the plot yet we know almost nothing abt his life. Also during his >!fight with sunny I got the impression that basil also has some type of headspace so it would be interesting to see how this affected him!<,2
I don’t hate Basil but I think his character is really shallow.  He’s a soft kid who likes flowers and has attachment issues, and that’s basically his entire character,4
it's not a joke 😳,1
Basil frustrates me, but he's the most visually pleasing.,1

I was rooting for Omori in BS,1
My opinion on basil depends on a daily coinflip: Heads I love him, Tails I hate him  . . . I got tails today, so I think he deserved to get beaten to death with Aubrey's nail bat.,1
Right? he's my favorite character,1
Oh.. I'm hated? Why?,1

i just hate sunflower shippers and basil by extension,1
wait they genuenly hate him? ,1
Yeah but why-,1
>!This little dipshit came in and thought the best course of action would be to cover up the crime in the most disgusting and disrespectful (to Mari and all her friends and family) way that just made everything much worse, I understand why Sunny didn't come up with the idea to call an ambulance, his mind just shattered at this point and even though Basil was traumatized as well he was lucid enough to stage a suicide that even fooled an expert instead of calling an expert that could have saved Maris life (in case she was still alive) !<,-8
I fucking hate that little shit with a burning passion,-22
no i fucking hate him. so much.,-4
basil is the 2. worst character in the game change my mind,-1
I'm sorry but I just have this irresistible urge to punt him to the moon,0
idk he just seems a little annoying and his anxiety to me seemed like it couldve been written better,0
He's like the nerd from Boyfriends but at least a bit more bearable. . >!THIS IS JUST A JOKE, I HATE BOYFRIENDS!<,-28
i actually do hate him,-4
Ill eat his fucking spine and become ninja fortnite,-5
Yeah basil kinda did SOMETHING I won’t speak of,1
Honestly I don't hate him, nor any Omori character at all (except for  bitch). He is more on the neutral side to me,1
Idrc i just like basil cuz hes cute,1

Yes, i lied.,1

F Bagel,1
he just rlly annoys me tbh he makes me think of those tumblr smol beans,1
Basil is actually rather popular as character and has a lot of fans. I would say that he has a hatedom, but they are mostly a minority IMO. . . People hate Sweetheart more.,1
I like Basil. . When he is in blackspace \[watermelon joke here\],1
Can people please explain me what the numbers you write mean? . Sorry for being dumb but I'm still wondering that lol,1
I LOVE HIM,1
[basil... pretty](),1
Here's what I know about him.. . He's a passive type of guy... like not fighting back against the Hooligans. People would then mistake him for being a wimp which could then be labeled as something else.. . He cracks under immense pressure, ESPECIALLY when time is limited (IT happened in the afternoon).. . He's Sunny's best friend (though I think "best friend" is applied to everyone but that's just my opinion).. . Combine these and you get a character who is "crazy" for the protagonist which could definitely be interpreted in the wrong way. Not to mention, he's the damsel in distress during the adventure.. . As for what he did that day and that night, it's reasonable to hate on his actions but do take account as to why he did it.,1

Basil is my all time favorite character,1
How can one hate this Poor Bean ? he is so cute ?! Wow heres says basil sucks ?! Unless youre chuck norris i will fight you,1

I love Basil...on my salat 😎,1
But it is a joke.,1
it’s called a serious game for a reason,1
We all love him and want him dead,1
Basil's a total bro. Helps cover up an accidental murder and never speaks of it no matter what.,1
It's weird seeing this post cuz my name is actually Basil lol,1
Basil needs a hug and a lot of therapy,1
My girlfriend dislikes him for whatever reason. Something him just being a cry baby and such.,1

Why all the hate man$$,1
how can anyone hate my traumatized baby?,1
poor flowerboy,1
I don't hate Basil I just wanna squish him and chuck him like a stress toy,1
I like basil I think he's really cool! I just however find what he did sooo unrealistic and dumb. What sunny did just sounds like what anyone would do. Then basil comes and just flips it. Id have liked if somehow it was a bit more realistic. Still nice flower boi tho :),1
edgy ppl I think,1
Basil smells like dirt and manure,1
I don’t really like Basil,1
i love basil. his birthday is right next to mine, and his beta name is my name. i love him,1
I don’t hate him. I just hate how the fandom treats him. Personally, he’s one of my lesser liked characters but he’s still a good one. I just hate how the fandom babies him so much, it’s incredibly annoying,1
I like him hes just a dude with some massive truama,1
I'm on "two days left" and I'm reading these comments like. idk what to tell you I don't have some fucking moral high ground hes literally just Annoying. I think characters are annoying that if they were people I wouldn't, sue me abt it or smthn,1

I really don't understand the hating basil thing, all of em went through shit and basil's just getting shit on for it while everyone else is just surviving,1

basil is hated?,1

Basil is my favourite . . I don't see why people hate him for having trauma,1

Basil is precious baby,1
Tbf I can understand why. I dont hate him for it, but I get why people would hate him.,1
I think that he did something horrible and he's not a good person, but I don't hate him, I think he is a well written character,1
Omori fans when they learn that people are not defined by their worst mistakes (it's the entire moral of the game),1
I love basil because I feel like my personality is some sort of amalgam of basil and kel’s personalities,1
basil is my boy,1
,1
Wait, people actually hate basil? I wish we'd gotten to know him a little betterbut for the entire game, I was dead set on saving him because he was far too precious.,1

guess you can say.. he becomes fruity either way EYYYYY,2
ik why i love watermelons now,2
whats wrong with him being sunnys lover ?. . is cute. . and you CANT convince me Basil isnt gay,1
i tldr'd it in [another comment]() but it's hard to feel more Grey abt a character we simply don't know beyond a surface level.. . we got to know everyone else thru lil comments or flavor text or even just the dreamworld, but basil? we never get to meet basil that deeply. how can any complex feelings come of that?,1
The wolf that wants to punt him is funnier though.,151

>!With Sunny it's that he does most of the work to undo his mistake and with Aubrey is that people just saw her hurt by a knife and decided she was some victim.!<. . I do believe that all 3 are redeemable characters and that they deserve happiness and in the context of the strongest, forgiving the one, but not the other is hypocritical.,60
Problem is İts not just one action. . Almost killing sunny at the last day. . Lying to everyone for four years. . Hanging mari. . So he is the hardest to forgive no matter how you see it but also fandom makes me hate basil they use the Trauma card like a pass card,4
rosa best character wth,1
What’s wrong with Hot Dighity Dog?,33

Thank god for Pluto,1
imo there's so fucking much of basil we don't know.. . - what happened to his parents?. - why was he scared of calling for help at The Incident?. - why was that his plan to help fix The Incident???. - what the FUCK trauma happened to make him distrust adults to the point that polly is literally in the dark and only maybe his grandmother understood and aspect of his life and she may have not even been awake for it all???. . people call basil annoying but i think his story is severely under-shown.. . we see sunny's side of the story. - his mom's absent. - his dad may have picked favorites w his own children. - sunny's always been a daydreamer. - sunny's become terrible at differentiating reality and fiction. . and all of this kinda explains shit like bringing a knife to the real life fight w aubrey, or him barging into other people's houses and just touching their shit.. . but what is basil's story of it all. what made him like this, to the point that talking to sunny (someone who didn't seem to respond verbally to things) was the most he felt heard and talked to??. . if sunny/omori's trauma reaction wasn't shared by basil, what was basil's reaction when *he* became a recluse?? did he ALSO have a fucked up version of reality from isolating himself in his room??? does he have a diary that explains himself more???. . the entire story of omori is set up so you don't know who basil is until the final third of it. it's set up so the whole process thru the deep sea and humphrey is more meaningful because it's easy to forget finding basil's ur Main Goal when he's someone u didn't ever meet or know.. . but when we DO meet basil, it's all plot related. we don't get to meet him like we do the other three. we don't get to see their quirks and personal growths and issues.. . - we learn kel acts how he is (like seeking u out to knock on the door) because even at the lowest after The Incident, his parents ignored him and went "What About Hero?". he's been framed to show the family attention has never been on him thinking abt himself, but thinking for others (obliviously and clumsily).. - we learn hero is the same in reverse, he "snaps out of it" after The Incident because of how kel was treated by their parents. his whole moveset is about helping keep others (and his own) HP up. it's kinda been frames he becomes a doctor BECAUSE of his mom, and if he wasn't a doctor he'd have been a chef BECAUSE if somebody else.. - aubrey has been shown to us to need to fend for herself. as a child she's more sensitive to the boys' banter because she HAS no one really looking out for her, and as she grows older she grows nails and claws and bites back with her own words when she never learned to properly cope with things. she wants to care about others, but she knows she needs to put herself first.. . but what do we know about basil and his history, *really*? if he's living with his grandma, what happened to his parents? are they alive? did they die? are they the ones paying polly to be an in home caretaker? when did basil move in to this city with his grandma in the first place???. . it's easy to hate a character who the plot relies so heavily on and yet we have the barest level knowledge of.. . does he even have hobbies besides plants and photography?,174
>!for me it’s that the way the real world version of Basil tried to save his friend was shockingly elaborate and twisted. Staging a suicide was the sickest possible way to cover an accident up.!<,287
Thanks for the EXTREMELY long paragraph, I made my interpretation of Basil in the comments.. . He's practically the most faulted both rightfully and wrongfully. He's a tragic character who saw something... in the wrong time. He's someone to depend to understand the faults of each character and their motives, he gives the compassion differently to Sunny than everyone else, he's not just "yeah he did bad" he is subject to the whole game starting.. . What I love is >!HEADSPACE Basil got the photo because I believe somewhere in Sunny's mind through remembering Mari, SOMETHING arrived to set their entire journey up, or at least my thoughts on it  !<he's done bad things but that doesn't mean he's bad, all characters go through pain and Sunny imo is the worst of them all since he's the reason it started.. . He lost his >!family, friends, Sunny who moved away!<, etc. Maybe he deserves some forgiveness in the end,13
What the F[ifty percent off] happened here?,10
Most people who hate don't feel this way about him because he is "annoying", but because they find his actions throughout the game as despicable and think of him as a psycho.. . >!The fact his first thought after witnessing his best friend killing his sister is to fake her suicide speaks volumes how mentally ill of a child he is to come up with this shit. The amount effort he was willing to put into doing something as horrible as desecrating the body of his supposed friend as well having enough conscious to put up a plan like this is definitely not something normal or good person would do.!<. . >!Besides his actions doubled the suffering of his friends especially Sunny's whose main fear and source of self hatred was created because Basil staged suicide with him. The worst part is that unlike Sunny he didn't isolate himself completely from outside world and actually had some insight to what Aubrey, Kel and Hero were going through and yet he chose to leave them suffering partly because of his actions for sake of his obsession with Sunny. The game is very consistent in showing how little they mean to him compared to Sunny.!<. . >!You could say that Sunny is just as bad as him for going through his plan and ignoring his friends for his own benefit however there are two important differences between him and Basil.!<. . >!First one is that we actually experience how much Sunny suffers throughout the game and how guilty he feels about what happened to Mari which makes it easier to emphasize with main character. Basil suffers ofcourse too from his actions however most of the pain seems to be only derived from Sunny abandoning him instead of anything else.!<. . >!Second one is that Sunny in the end finds a courage to go out of his house, save his friends and tell them truth about Mari because they deserve it showing us how much he cares about them to be willing to lose them forever just do what's right.!<. . >!Unlike Sunny Basil seems to have little if any redeemable qualities at all to overshadow the sins he committed. No matter how relatable is situation may be it doesn't change what horrible things he has done.!<. . I myself don't hate him, but morally he is by far most ambiguous character in the game and I am tired when some people depict him as some kind of soft boy angel. He is someone way different and complex than this bullshit.,7
Now this is something I can get behind,128
A ton of bosses wouldn’t have happened it it weren’t for her,53
 I agree whole-heartedly with that. Oh and the bee too,35
FINALLY! I get that she’s cute and all but people are really out here simping for a ~~doughnut~~ woman who was mentally and physically abusing her partner!,33
Yes omfg I  couldn’t stand her and she’s such a big part of the game for the longest section it felt like,17
WRONG! Sweetheart is THE BEST character!!!!!!. . >!j!<,2
I completed her stage fairly quick, so I don't have that issue,1
Absolute banger of a theme though,1
What if i think all the characters are epic?,379
I think ever person in the og friend group has done some bad so... spoilers . . . Kel-he has a hard time understanding emotions (least bad BTW) . . HERO- bottles up his emotions and lashes out on others . . Mari- seemingly is a perfecionist and here's a wacky theory she only dated hero bc he was perfect (80% I'm wrong on this) . . Aubry - her whole life after the 4 years can be sumed up to this one line "You followed your wrath" as she bullies basil with out letting him talk why "he" destroyed the pictures . . Sunny and basil - do I even need to talk about those 2 their easily the worst (basil worse tho),1
Quick, get out before we end up like the Undertale fandom,34
Yeah I remember when like a year ago more, when OMORI was new, nobody hated on Basil. At least it wasn't a trend.,5
Yeah I remember when like a year ago more, when OMORI was new, nobody hated on Basil. At least it wasn't a trend.,1
Basil being buried alive six feet under with a white phosphorus IED ticking next to him, for starters.. . /s,7
>annoying (the fuck). . This is the go-to word when you dislike a character for no reason. I have seen it EVERYWHERE (although it's usually female characters, for some reason).. . &#x200B;. . And yes I know this comment is 9 months old, if that pisses you off for some reason don't respond,2
Same. He's enjoyable, and serves his purpose in the narrative well. But as a *character,* he's definitely not one of my favorites (mainly because the others are just better fleshed out, and the time I spent with them helped me grow to love them all organically).. . Aside from how little we actually learn about him, I think the biggest thing that always put me off is how forcefully the game tries to condition you to feel protective of Basil at the start. The fight with BOSS, while an interesting narrative juxtaposition with Aubrey's first encounter, only exists to distract you from how complicated the situation between Aubrey and Basil in Faraway Town was. I didn't buy it for a second, and knew their was far more going on than the game showed us at first. Once we got to the fight at the lake, it was increasingly obvious just how much Basil was hiding from us, and how little Aubrey and the Hooligans were actually doing to him. When she finally screamed at Basil about "what he did", I stopped viewing him as the true victim.,5
>!Yeah, it makes me wonder are those people literally stupid? "Basil did a lot of bad things!11", well if you can blame a TWELVE year old, then Aubrey is a lot worse since she nearly killed someone whilst being 16... (I do like Aubrey, I was just giving an example)!<,26
I have zero idea how to spoiler text so I’m just gonna leave this because it’s not even spoilers anyways,17
Kinda messed up tbh..,4
Basil AND Aubrey do a lot of messed up stuff. Fighting over which one did worse things is pointless,61
In my opinion, anyone who pickes and chooses what character they forgive completely miss the point of the game.. . Also, Kel and Hero are not innocent. Kel antagonized and attacked Aubrey at every point in the game and even before, and Hero, a long while ago, absolutely lashed out at Kel. Hero is probably the only character that is relatively fine now, but it's wrong to think he hasn't done anything bad at all.,78
EXACTLYYYY. . I don’t hate Aubrey but she was so selfish after the thing happened.,6
Becoming in tolerable? Like Undertale's fandom? Lmfao if this Basil hate is the worst you've seen, you haven't seen anything yet. Most of the Basil hate is from people who aren't even super into the game.,1
From the unused descriptions for the Truth photo album:. . >Photo of Guilt - You want to scream for help, but you're afraid... you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? There's no way you can tell them the truth. Who would be able to forgive him? Who would believe... that it was... an accident?. . So that's why. He was 12 and panicking because he thought his friend would be treated as a murderer, not thinking of the future consequences that would come from hanging her.,47
He was young and panicked.,21
I think he was already in a dark place mentally back then (just hiding it under his happy exterior). I mean the boy was 12 and decided that suicide by hanging was the smart move for what to do to hide what happened. Clearly that isn’t the sign of someone in a good mental state. I think he already had some issues with depression/anxiety/abandonment issues back then.,1
I just think he’s fine, but his character just feels mediocrely written >!with the explanation of the incident!<,9
Throwing a tantrum and pushing your sibling over the edge is what 12 year olds do, >!staging a suicide and even do it in a way that it fools a forensic expert in my opinion goes beyond normal 12 year old behavior !<,4
Differance between sunny and basil are how they end the game sunny overcome his something and came back to reality but basils last action is stabbing sunny . . But also both aubrey and sunny didnt intent for what happend but basil always had a say in it. . Am i saying he is a criminal ? No. İ am saying İts so much harder to forgive him,1
Forgiving,8
Yeah in general I don’t really trust people who hate the shy/insecure/kind characters like Basil, like they find it annoying. Besides that it’s especially ofd with these traumatized children. Like no one’s at fault here!! They were *12*.(except Hero and Mari) Have the haters learnt nothing from Omori?,10
He’s darn 12,10
> He just did what he thought would protect his best friend which backfired. . Not only did it backfire, it ended up causing exactly what he so desperately wanted to prevent, while also putting some of the guilt upon him. Seriously, with how badly Basil got screwed, hating him seems almost cruel.,16
BAGEL BOI IS BEST BOI (or is he a watermelon, I can't tell),6
Strongest Basil Hater vs Weakest 50/50 enjoyer. . ,1
Well, 12 yo. But yeah that was messed up (i still love him though),1
Fo real though (kinda). First time I played the game I thought Kel didnt really care about sunny at all and only wanted the money for Hero's gift. I was thinking like, man, first time seeing tour friend in 4 years and you ask for a 20?,7
naw dont do the flower boy like that ,4
As a watermelon,4
All his actions were done with intent but also he tried to kill sunny at the end of the game,sunny litarally jumped to save his life twice on contrast (the lake and the last day),3
nah, I hate him because people baby him so fucking much to the point where he seems like a 2 year old,1
There was no pulse,2
Basil didn’t want anyone to find out about it because he was worried Sunny might get in trouble if that happened, and he was terrified of anything happening to his best friend.,7
Tbf I've seen a lot of danganronpa fans hate on Mikan and/or Hiyoko too,8
For me the last two are reversed. I think Basil’s a sympathetic and at least somewhat likeable character, But Hiyoko’s vulgar attitude was off-putting to me, and >!Mikan dying at the end of chapter 3 was one of my favorite parts about that chapter.!<,1
How TF is Basil an alpha male?,7
Skill Issue.,7
[removed],4
Well to start yes it was his idea to hang her but also he lied to everyone for four years then he tries to kill sunny "stop struggling,sunny" and then contrast to sunny never reedems himself his litarally Last action is attemted murder on sunny,2
Also basil isn’t manipulative I genuinely hate when people say that,0
Sunny scribbled the photos,1
Then I'm badly written because that's literally me, lmao.,11
he was 12,18

There is a difference between an excuse and a motivation. Trauma is not an excuse. What Basil did was wrong. But it is a completely valid motivation, you can understand why he did what he did even if it was bad.,235

*”Just because you did something bad, doesn’t make you a bad person”*. . -Kel, 199X,84

well we are talking about Bagel here,28
,31
*cronch*,4
,1
His memories were broken, and the truth did go unspoken,4
This has an intimidating aura that I can't comprehend,1
Under his circumstances I can see why he did that, he lied for Sunny’s sake, though it was his fault, lost almost everything, and he is losing his grandmother, he gets bullied by Aubrey’s gang for something he didn’t do, reuniting with sunny only to find out he is moving away, of course he would go mad, and he would commit suicide if you didn’t help him, honestly I think basil is forgiveable, even if it’s hard,32
I know this is super old but like, two of those things Sunny also did, he also lied to everyone about what happened and he also hung Mari. Why do people hold those actions more against Basil than Sunny?,8
But sunny also hung mari and lied to everyone, and almost killing sunny was because basil was about to kill himself,2
I'm not sure if I can speak for the first commenter but I don't like that dog cause it blocked the way to Basil's house at some point in headspace and I was really worried I wouldn't be able to water Basil's flowers cause I assumed that was a vital step to getting a good ending on my first playthrough.,111
That damn bee will be the death of me. And he already has been once,19
This. This perfectly encapsulates all of Basil's problems. He just wasn't explored enough compared to everyone else. Granted, that does leave plenty of room for fan interpretation but the base game should have really let us know more about him.,68
Hopefully some of the switch exclusive content gave give us some more info, Basil seems to be a big focus in it.,6
Ratio,1
[deleted],283
>!Yeah, what people tend to forget, even if he did with good intentions, what he did in the end was hanging his own friend to "protect" another, letting everyone else in the believe Mari killed herself causing immense pain not just through loss but survivor's guilt as well !<,64
Yeah I'm not his biggest fan over this, who knows what would've happened if Basil didn't guide Sunny through all that,10
>!Basil had to do something horrible in order for his amount of guilt to be as bad as Sunny's, they both did something horrible, but that doesn't make them horrible people.!<. . >!As someone who's been through a very traumatic event, at the time it was happening nothing felt like reality, I was entirely in self-preservation mode, as if I was in a nightmare. I made a lot of mistakes because I couldn't think straight, I just wanted to get out of the situation. !<. . >!To me it makes sense Basil would impulsively do something drastic out of fear of losing Sunny. !<,2
Wait, what,-5
waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought >!Sunny staged the suicide, and Basil photographed it. Did I interpret that scene wrong? It was all disjointed photos, but Basil being the photographer, I thought he was the one taking the pics (because he didn't know what else to do). I would argue it's far from elaborate, though. He was in a panic, and a child. And, from what they've probably seen of death, if you cause one, you're in trouble, and since she fell, she probably had wounds. The only way for a death to occur that isn't punished, from their limited knowledge, was for it to be self inflicted. Regardless of who did it, I could absolutely not blame them, being as young, traumatized, and panicked as they were. People have done far worse, far more elaborate, and far less sensical things in similar states.!<,1
Well I don't know the spoiler thing but SPOILERS AHEAD. . . . . their was a thound better ways to do it n.1 make as if she triped as she has a bad knee and it wasn't that hard to lie saying "her bad knee made her trip and she fell" . Or just calling the ambulance she probably wasn't dead as hell before the hanging,1
Calling Basil a psycho is just stigmatizing actually psychopaths, he has no characteristics of a psychopath. . . >!Again mental illness doesn't correlate with doing bad things and the story does enough to give us Basil's perspective on things and even Sunny does have a view of him that doesn't paint him as the evil guy the haters make him out to be. He might have done somethingbad but that alone makes him not bad and that is true for Sunny as well!<. . >!Basil made the situations worse for Sunny than before, but it isn't like Sunny had anything against this idea, since he helped with the cover up. He didn't wanted to believe he killed his own sister and didn't wanted to live with that. Basil, who understood this made the plan with empathy in mind. Basil's problem isn't a lack of care, it's him caring too much and doesn't actually have consequences for the actions people take against him or others, which is why he does not fight back for most of the story. Also the reason why he didn't said anything was so that no one would hate Sunny and though it seems like he doesn't care about them, I see it as him not really feeling deserving of their friendship after what he did. Obsession is also the wrong word, because he never forced Sunny to be with him, he didn't even broke into Sunny's home in all these 4 years and in the end accepted Sunny moving out, if we can go by the good ending.!<. . The differences you want to point out has many flaws in their arguments:. . >!1. We see a lot of Basil being haunted by it and though it can be see from Sunny's perspective, I think it's due to him understanding Basil very well and knows that he also didn't liked what he has done. . 2. Sunny is also under a different position than Basil. He has pushed Mari and knows that it was him until he repressed it, while Basil could never have believed that, he believes that something did it and as such his view on the event is obscured and not accurate. He does not know it was Sunny, only unconsciously, but he was under the delusion that it was something else. Basil could have never told anyone really anything, that they would also have understood. Kel, Aubrey and Hero would have been more confused by his explanation than anything or come to the conclusion themselves, though mostly they would get him therapy sessions. He cannot speak up the truth because the full picture has only Sunny, who has the best memory of the group.. 3. His fear of departure is due to being left truly alone after Sunny is gone, and he doesn't want to deal with all the stuff he did on his own rather than wanting to possess Sunny.. 4. I disagree that Basil doesn't have redeeming qualities; For one we do see a lot of good qualities of Basil throughout the story, with the headspace, the black space and the real world, both past and present as well. Basil obviously cares for the group as he made the photo album, grew flowers for each of them and in the end was the one to encourage Sunny to come out after he was unconscious as Sunny knows that deep down, Basil shares the same anguish as him and both know what has to be done.!<. . >!Ultimately Basil is very complex and he actually is one of the most interesting characters, but the qualities you seem to not really see in Basil are parts of what makes him who he is. He is the soft boy angel, he is also the bagel you love to eat, but he is also the one to lie about what his best friend did and made that many times worse than it already was. I think his kindness is not a bullshit thing, it is a huge part of him that shouldn't be denied when viewing his character. Basil and Sunny are shown to be good people who did bad things, but they ultimately are able to undo that damage. That is how I think the game wanted to make us see it, after all Sunny and Basil are both important for the best outcome of the story and without either one of them, there is no good ending.!<,17

Based.,29
Then you are right.,25
This is the one objectively correct statement.,14
Except Sweetheart,3
I would say that no fandom would ever reach the depths of the Undertale fandom, but I did say it in the beginnings of the FNF fandom, and nowadays that fandom makes the Undertale fandom look like the Kirby fandom.,35
Undertale representative here:. . Yep, our reputation has been destroyed :(. . I haven't been in the Undertale fandom for a lot of the drama, but I see why it's so controversial on the outside, despite being pretty chill nowadays lol :D,8
Good times, then everything changed when the hate nation attacked,2
You posted this twice :|,1
basil's so feminine he gets affected by misogyny,4
And also the way that in the beginning Aubrey said she wasn't the one who started it also made me feel like there was something Basil wasn't telling us about,3
Um, what? The game shows multiple times that the hooligans do actually bully basil? We see him litreally get attacked by them in the very first rw cutscene? Also, besides the thing they are getting mad at him for is pretty dumb (aubrey already fixed the photo album) that's not to say I hate aubrey emotions make you do dumb stuff but saying basil was actually never a victim reduces the situation so much,1
I think you have to start and end the spoilers in the same paragraph for it to work, you can't split it up,11
I mean…it IS the same line of thinking that went into making the game. . . Looking at you, Omori devs.,1
I feel like the fanbase has a tendency to hold the characters to a high standard. obviously, everyone has their own opinions on who was the "worst" after "the incident," but in the end it was mostly trauma response. the characters in omori are fleshed out and imo realistic. their motives for potentially harmful actions have reasons- take aubreys home life for example. much like real life too, people arent perfect, and thats part of what i like about the characters. like hypervexed said, thats the point of the game. they are flawed. it doesnt make sense to pick who was for lack of better words "validated" to react the way they did.,43
>Kel antagonized and attacked Aubrey at every point in the game. . Sorry, but that's just wrong.  . . . In the first encounter, Aubrey and Kim antagonized the boys first. Aubrey decided to verbally harass Sunny for sitting at home for 4 years and then decided to assault both Sunny and Kel while Kim pushed Basil a few times.  . . . In the second encounter, everyone was equally in the wrong. Sunny barged in before the sermon ended, Kel tried to get the album back instead of pulling Sunny back outside or stopping him from entering and waiting for the sermon to end, and Aubrey started arguing with Kel to the point where it got physical. No one was in the right.  . . . In the third encounter, Kel only wanted to help Basil. Imagine finding your old friend crying for help while a bunch of delinquents that you've already previously fought are surrounding him. Plus, he barely attacks her unless you use the pepper spray. And while Aubrey doesn't attack Sunny and Kel in the fight, she doesn't stop the hooligans from doing so.  . . . You could've at least tried to bring up the exact points where bad things happened purely because of Kel's actions instead of generalizing all of his actions and demonizing him for no reason.  . If you really want to show what Kel did wrong, you can bring up the lake cutscene where Kel sent Sunny to save Basil from drowning and forgot that he's afraid of swimming.,18
People don't forgive Sweetheart and yet she had it not that easy at all. Forgiveness is ultimate about ceasing resentment, but that choice is difficult and you don't need to do that, >!you can just jump from a rooftop.!<. . >!Kel didn't attacked Aubrey, she attacked him for wanting to defend his friend from her. The only instances where he did something bad was that he didn't spoke to her as kindly as he should have done, but most of Aubrey's problems in the real world are self inflicted, she alienated her old friends. He however did not try to help them with this after 4 years and so did his friends.!<,2
Basil hate isn't the worst thing I've seen. I never said that? I've been in a bunch of fandoms, I know that there's TONS of worst stuff out there.,7
The descriptions are from Sunny's POV, we don't know if Basil was feeling the same way, especially since he staged the whole thing. He did probably start feeling the guilt after the group was fractured and more importantly after Sunny "left him" but we don't know if those are the only reasons he regretted doing what he did.,2
That, I can understand. Especially for a video game character, where all their woes are coded and can't affect the world.. . But let's be frank, he still >!covered Mari's death!< even if he's 12, worsening the situation and dragging the drama for about 4 years until Sunny walks out. Besides, the game gives most of the limelight to the other three friends, and the most we managed to overtly see Basil is in Blackspace, which is Sunny's thought about Basil. The game does everything in its power to tell us that Basil has a part in Mari's situation and little that overtly sympathize with the flower boy.. . Yes, signs of Basil's suffering are all over the place, but it takes second place in the drama of others.. . Because of that, by the second time I fight Basil, I was wishing Sunny would shove a knife between Basil's eyes. And I once considered the ending where Sunny >!let Basil die!< the canonical ending of the game because the two bastards got their comeuppance.,0
So was Sunny, but he didn't think of anything like THAT.,2
Most likely, but it's all speculation with no concrete evidence in the game proper. It probably would have made him more sympathetic if we ever got too see him explain himself. If not to the others, then at least to Sunny.. . Then again, maybe Basil's motivations and background are better left open to interpretation. I've seen some fics fill in the gap nicely so that's good at least.,1
\>!"normal 12 year old behavior" I doubt Basil was a normal 12 year old, and it's unfair to expect him to act like one.!<. . also hi milks,9
have you met a 12 yo before,5
It's what I said up there, I left the game with confliting thoughts. His actions were shit, but it was definitly panic.,2
Idk if I’d go that far, I would argue Sunny is very much at fault and responsible, that’s why he’s haunted by the deed to the extent that the truth would literally kill him. But yet even so the olive branch is extended to him as it must be. People hating kind characters like they’re too good or too purposefully cloying is not something I really get though, especially when Basil really isn’t that.,3
[deleted],10
Aren't they 14 in the current day timeline?,1
For me it was that he didn't seem to care as much about mari in the real world, and that he kicked the flower crown in headspce. . Like yea they forgot about Basil and all, but kicking some random flower crown is just an asshole move :(,4
[removed],1
That's the fandom's fault.,5
still, hanging her is actually the worse option,1
they could just say  "she tripped",0
I myself haven't been much of a fan for Hiyoko. But, while I agree on your statement I would see more people who adore the two (I'm the one's who actually likes Mikan) than those who hate on them.,2
Fr about Hiyoko. She has been so rude and was also off putting for me too ,2
wdum? (btw if its about the speccilg sry I suck I have dyslexia!),2
oh no,5
I don’t know. I don’t think he’s a bad person I mean wasn’t he literally 12 YEARS OLD? I feel like his way of coping and handling it was just W A Y worse than Sunny. I may be just giving him too much credit and leeway but idk,3
>!You don’t think properly when you were 12, and he wanted to protect sunny, and in the end he lost everything, he only has his helper left to comfort him and he might lose his grandma too!<,11

Because Lines like these "It tells you to follow its lead. It says... it's the only way out... It says... that everything will be okay.". . "You hear pacing, the crunching of the grass sifting back and forth. You think you see a figure pick something off the ground, but you’re not sure. You keep staring at the leaves overhead. Everything will be okay... You think... Everything will be okay.". . "You hear shuffling. You hear dragging... and creaking... and pulling. Something is happening, but you refuse to look away from the leaves. Your head feels fuzzy again. You bite your tongue and attempt to wake up one last time, but it’s no use... You’re still here.". . These are all in sunnys pov so it makes it sound like sunny didnt even know what was happening and was following basils lead and didnt even help the hanging part as he hears basil hanging her but doesnt look . . And about the lie basil unlike sunny who actually forgotten the accident (dissotive amnesia i think is the term) basil has full memory of it but refuses to tell them,5
I mean... You weren't *wrong*, but you weren't really right either,27
i can't blame anyone for hating him. if someone is a weirdo creeper asshole IRL, you don't GET to hear their tragic backstory.. . and even if you DID, would it change that they did a weirdo asshole thing?. . i sympathize with basil's clear signs of trauma and clear fucked up mentality before he even did The Thing, but it's up to everyone's interpretation of "how fucked up is Too Fucked Up to justify". . . some people dislike sunny because of the same reason. sunny has "it was an accident" as an excuse, but we need to always remember. 1) it's omori's/sunny's perspective, he may skew the perception of himself unintentionally. 2) the End Result being worse than the Intended Outcome of Conscious Action doesn't resolve him of blame. he's a child, but he still Did The Action, if that makes sense.. . sorry abt Vagueness, i'm trying to not have to spoiler chunks while being Spoiler Free.,21
from what i've heard, unfortunately not. it seems like basil joins for a boss rush thing maybe??? the discord talked a bit about it, but i'm planning on buying the Not Yet Released physical edition (i like to collect physical copies of games that make an impact) so i hadn't tuned in all that deeply.,8
Omori lore,129
this is a really good analysis on basil i love and care him so much and i didn't know how to put that into words until now LOL,44
I'm interested in why you think Basil is queer-coded? Personally I haven't seen any, but if you have any reasoning beyond him being clingy and him having some traditionally feminine aspects I'd love to hear it.,54
This is such a good analysis that I'm bookmarking it. Thank you,12
It should not be possible to be this fucking based. I love seeing long, analytical takes like this.,6
👏👏👏,1
>!He was a 12 year old put into a situation where he just saw his best friend kill their sister. It's not like he thought deeply about the ramifications of what framing a suicide entails. He was stressed the fuck out, and I don't think I need to tell you people don't make good decisions in those types of situations, especially not children. He immediately regrets doing it the moment he realizes what he just did. The game really shows you just how utterly ruined he is afterwards.!<. . >!This does raise the concerning question of why the hell would a 12 year old's first instinct be to frame a suicide in this situation? Like seriously Basil, what the shit happened to you? Don't fucking tell me you've been having suicidal thoughts at that age...!<,109
You've finished the game... right?,6
110% agree! During stressful situations, everyone reacts differently. Flight, fight, freeze. Then there's survival mode. Then there's rationalizing... . . Everyone here is putting a lot of pressure and expectation on a 12 year old who likely hasn't encountered death before outside of going to a relative's funeral or losing a pet, so knowing the consequences of his actions isn't something he's going to think about in the moment of trauma. Also, the fact people call a 12 year old a psycho because he doesn't, in the moment of someone's death and coming to grips with his friend's responsibility in the literal minutes afterward, when he is so used to being alone, is honestly a drastic take. >! His parents aren't around, he's constantly taken care of by a nanny whose primary focus is on someone more in need, his grandma, so he has to fend for himself and has few role models. Kids aren't equipped with the same knowledge adults are, so they'll focus on what's most important IN THE MOMENT. For him, it was making sure Sunny wouldn't be branded a murderer for what was an accident, but to a kid, killing is killing. There isn't time to reason out the nuance or philosophy when you haven't been trained. Even adults panic under stress. !<. . IMO, Basil is a lonely kid who beats himself up over things he has no control over. >!His absentee parents, his grandma dying, the SOMETHING that he believes was behind Sunny's shoulder and killed Mari... he's even beating himself up enough that he thinks suicide is his best course of action to take the secret to the grave, unless you intervene. !<. . What I think is important is even if people hate Basil, that's valid. Because Basil, IMO, would agree with them. That hateful reaction is exactly WHY he feels the way he does. He would've internalized those opinions that he's demented, psycho, or a monster. >!Basil may not have understood the consequences of his actions as a kid, but as he grew older, he saw himself as broken and guilty and he believes his only redeemable quality was he thought he was doing "the right thing" at the time. And he holds on to that belief because if he doesn't, then all the pain he witnesses his friend going through afterwards was meaningless. !<. . I know a lot of people thought it was unfair and cruel >! for Basil to keep it hidden, but ultimately  he wasn't the one who pushed Mari. Sunny was in shock and unresponsive after he cried when they put her back in her bed, so Basil, having few role models to emulate and likely little experience in an emergency, panicked and did his best in a situation like this. !<. . Is it an excuse? No. But does the Basil hate actual justify and contextualize his reasoning? Yes. And if it means he thought he'd protect Sunny from the same hate and accept his bad ending? Absolutely yes.. . Plus, I have to respect him for not revealing the truth, because >! it wasn't his place to tell everyone Sunny's secret. That had to be Sunny's decision. And what no one else knew, even Basil, is that Sunny couldn't remember. So to Basil, if Sunny wasn't telling anyone, then he assumed that keeping it as secret was what Sunny wanted. It's only in the good ending, where Sunny tells everyone himself, that Basil feels a weight off his shoulders and his own SOMETHING disappears. !<,4

I'm curious. I was in the Undertale fandom when it was most active but I don't recall anything particularly horrendous, but it's commonly labelled nowadays as the worst fandom to ever exist. What actions warranted such a description?,17
Kirby fandom is still shit from my experiences,0
>!thank you!<,2
They’re excused for making this amazing game lol,2
I agree, though I wanna add some things:. . >!After the first encounter, Kel took away Sunny's knife, due to how dangerous it is as weapon, showing us that Kel is someone who doesn't want to hurt others unless he needs to. Pragmatically, it was a bad decision, since it was the only thing saving them from Aubrey, but from a moral standpoint, it shows a lot of care for others that the Kel back then might not have shown.!<. . >!I feel like Aubrey did most of the wrong stuff in the church, while Sunny did step into the church before the sermon ends and where Aubrey would be more likely to talk with them, the church isn't going to save her from real life consequences like theft and she should have admitted here her wrongdoings, especially when in Christianity, stealing is a sin. Kel could get some flak for his tactless approach with Aubrey while talking but the fact that he even tried to talk with her and even showed compassion and understanding shows that he trusts her enough to hold a conversation with her. Aubrey while being disturbed during a sermon shows no real understanding of her friends pain or what she has been doing; Hurting them. While both parties made mistakes, Aubrey made much more IMO. !<. . >!The delinquents also didn't tried to prove that they weren't hurting Basil by wanting him gone from the hangout spot and didn't really understood why Kel wants them to stop bulling Basil, which shows that they didn't care for him and that they don't respect him. Aubrey then attacks them with a group of 6(technically 5, since Charlene isn't attacking them). Even if Aubrey wins against Kel, she still hasn't enough of them after he pointed out how hypocritical she us being.!<. . >!Aubrey could have needed softer criticism, but she didn't made it easy for others and only then admitted what she did was wrong, when she nearly ended Basil. Also didn't Kel forgot that Sunny nearly drowned? I think it's hard to blame him for forgetting this, since it was 4 years ago. Kel's biggest mistake was  trying to reach just to Hero after the incident and not the others.!<,7
I feel like you're taking this a step further than what the above comment implied. Kel was 100% being antagonizing in some form in every encounter, he always failed to be the bigger person and try to talk Aubrey down. He tries to in the church, but only after accusing Aubrey more, beating around the bush a lot, and then immediately goes back to insulting her.. . It's true he isn't as violent, but he makes it clear he's mad at Aubrey and won't back down. He fails to reconcile with her and to be the bigger person in every encounter. The above comment never implied Aubrey wasn't in the wrong in those encounters either, but Kel was still participating in making things worse.,1
It was heavily implied by you complaining about the Basil hate and then leading into complaining about the fandom. We're still far from Undertale at the start of the fandom.,-2
Most of them are Sunny's POV, but this photo description specifically seems to be Basil's. "Who would be able to forgive **him** \[Sunny\]?". . There isn't anyone else that "him" could be referring to - it can't be Basil, because Basil hadn't done anything yet.,11
The Game centers more around Basil than any other characetr other than Sunny. . . The game introduces Basil's character as the kindest person in the group and his disappearance starts the plot of Omori's biggest arc :Search for Basil. . . From there we also focus on helping Basil with his real life problems and the most important events in the real world are all about and surtound Basil. . The game does very little to prove that he hanged Mari, only did it hint us at him being the closest to the truth and then revealing to us what happened.  By the time you confront him about it, his view is completely distorted. . Really? The game goes on its waybto make you empathise with Basil and make you care about him as they show him as the kind and gentle person in the very beginning of thr game and as a victim of bullying, the game id more sympathetic towards him than it is to any other character, except Sunny. . . Also no character was as traumatised and suffered from Mari's death more than Basil. Sunny could escape into his imaginations, but Basil's problems did not and had to life 4 years with this knowledge, whereas Sunny suppressed it. The others suffered,  but they didn't bear this cross on their back and had many ways to deal with it like finding nee friends and succeeding in life. . . If you really wished Basil death for Basil, then I ask myself if you really cared about the game's themes and message, because that line of thinking is frequently shown as evil and not really fair and just at all. This tells me more about your flawed views than that of Basil's and even then, it's in his case trauma and delusions, not malice.,11
Because people panic differently.,2
I agree with you, he didn't have parents to educate him ,2
Fair enough,2
Yeah, I was 12 years once and I have a siblings who was 12 years old and I didn't >!had any idea how you would frame a suicide (I still don't know how to tie a noose) !< same goes for my brother (I hope so),-1
Well technically it’s his fault.. But really it was a heated argument like any other family has sometimes, he just happened to panic and pushed her at the wrong time and in the wrong place.. Personally it just feels wrong to blame a kid, especially Sunny.. . Agreed.,1
That’s just one more reason to feel bad for him! The poor kid probably found out from some tv show or books or smth(maybe he already had severe anxiety, who knows) and his parents seemed absent.,6
You might as well say babies shouldn’t cry when they’re hungry, they’re stupid, that doesn’t make them bad,1
Nope. The younger (sunny, basil, kel and aubrey) are 16 and hero is 19,2
I don’t think that he didn’t seem to care as much, I just think he did a better job than anyone else of dealing with his trauma. I feel like by the time we see Kel in the real world he’s learned to accept what happened.,12
,2
Right, but Basil wasn’t thinking clearly at the time.,3
Yeah, >!Chapter 3 was a nice 2 for one deal in that regard!< ,2
The big problem is he tried to kill sunny when he was 16,1
boyfriends is an astronomically cringe web-comic about a bunch of boyfriends.,12
Boyfriends is a cringe comic that's about a poly relationship between 4 guys. It's too difficult for me to explain so I'm just gonna let someone else explain it or you can search for the advertisements on YouTube,3
,128
,1
Well yeah, they didnt want to get caught LOL. Nobody is saying it isn't wrong. But everyone is saying that they can see why. I don't think my 12 year old mind could handle that I killed my older sister, and it showed because both Sunny and Basil were >!suicidal!<,81
Same here, I actually kinda dislike Sunflower, but that's just it isn't heavily implied canonically, unlike Sunburn. Nevertheless, I still respect Sunflowers.,63
Ohhhh i see i see. . I never found these lines myself in game or by searching around, that does help it make more sense,6
Wtf, comments deleted, wtf happened here,3
[deleted],112
Well queer coded isn't specifically for queer characters, being non confrontation, soft, liking flowers and being shy are traits stereotypically given to gay men/gender non conforming amab.. Queer coded are for characters that holds lots of traits stereotypically given to queer people.,36
Nothing in the game says anything definite about sexuality for any character. It is up to the player to see how they view them, so here are my thoughts.  . . . Basil is pretty androgynous and doesn't stand out as either a girl or boy too much. The name is also pretty neutral. This basically describes a lot of non-binary people and how many are in that neutral/androgynous zone. I also found that flower crowns are a subtle symbol for being an ally or part of the queer community. Lots of celebrities who are allies or queer have worn them, and or people have edited them on in photos. I have also seen them on many queer-coded characters in shows and games as well... either canon or as popular fanart.,15
i don't think it's all that unrealistic or rare for a child that age to have suicidal thoughts.. . As concerning as it may sound, it might be true, it is hard to deal with those feelings when you're not mature enough to properly process them.,14
>!Yeah, I get that and I don't blame Basil for not considering the consequences of his actions, it just leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth that he did the most fucked up thing to protect Sunny but seemingly (we don't really have information on that) doesn't even care about Mari or the fact that she might still be alive, sunny was too mentally unstable to take appropriate actions but what is Basil's excuse to not call an ambulance and staging a suicide as first impulse? !<. . BTW, it should go without saying, but I don't intend to engage in a serious arguement with strangers about fictional characters, I'm just curious about the opinions of others and I don't intend by any means to offend people who have different opinions than I have,15
Oh right, fuck that guy,13
The fact that u couldnt skip it either boiled my blood,11
Oh god. That thing killed me while I was running from the cat experiment in Humphrey. I’ll never forget that fear,2
good bot ,15
It’s the “We Must Hate The Popular Thing” effect. The fandom was never really any worse than any other of comparable size, but people hated Undertale because it was popular. So they picked out the worst bits of the fandom and complained about it because it’s easier to do that than criticize the game. . . Not that complaining about a fandom is some kind of abhorrent sin or anything, but to an outside observer all they see are people outside the community pointing out it’s worst aspects.,12
There was a literal murder attempt because someone didn't like an artist shipping certain characters. Also countless death threats to countless creators who did seemingly innocent things like voicing a character a certain way, making a crossover animation, or making a theory about one of the characters.. . Not even FNF or MCYT has gotten to the levels of actual attempted murder.,3
Shitty AUing over and over, a bunch of overly angsty shit, the skeleton brothers fucking everyone including themselves, ect. However, most of this was during the first 2 years after it got popular, so most of bad shit has died down.,1
What’s wrong with it? I love Kirby but I never really took part in the fandom,1
>he always failed to be the bigger person and try to talk Aubrey down. . The thing is that he tried.. . First encounter: Tried to talk to her and protect Basil, Aubrey didn't explain anything and got violent.. . Second encounter: Tried to talk her into calmly returning the album, Aubrey started bickering with him instead of explaining anything about her and Basil and got violent.. . Third encounter wasn't really about her, it was about the hooligans who didn't even try to prove that they weren't hurting Basil. Guess what, this also got violent!  . . . >he's mad at Aubrey and won't back down. . If you saw your ex-friend bullying your friend who couldn't fight back and refusing to explain why they're doing it, wouldn't you be mad too? Oh, and Aubrey's been quite disrespectful towards Sunny too (called him out about "being in a bubble for 4 years" after his sister died) which further antagonized Kel.  . . . >He fails to reconcile with her and to be the bigger person in every encounter.. . I'll sum it up: If Aubrey could give a shit and at least try to talk to Kel and explain what's happening instead of acting tough and assaulting him and Sunny, all of this could've been avoided. It's not purely Kel's fault, it's mostly Aubrey's fault.,3
I think the game does show and empathize with how characters deal with the Mari incident. However, I still do think that the game still empathizes with others more than Basil, at least on a surface level.. . While the game introduces Basil as the sweet kind flower boy, it's in Headspace. It's a dream, and dreams suffer from inaccuracies and personal biases, even if Sunny has photographic memories. . . While most of the plot, in both real life and the dreams, focuses around helping Basil, Basil himself is seldom shown. Even if he does, he's shown to be a target of Aubrey's rage, which is when the limelight shines on Aubrey and why she picked on the boy instead of... well, the boy.. . On Day 3, we go out and retrieve Basil's photo album, but we're shown that Aubrey becomes a bully, how Kel has grown up, how real life influences Sunny's dream, and how Basil is connected to >!Mari being six-feet under!< (which can be misinterpreted as Basil threatening Sunny, according to one of my friends.). . Most of the limelight is on Kel, how he changed (or not changed) throughout the years, and how there are clues about how Aubrey is actually feeling, because the former is trailing us and the latter being the bastard of the day. . . Basil got delegated into an NPC quest giver who shows the worst excess of his mental trauma.. . Day 2 begins by building up on Kel again, showing more of his rare maturity, sprinkling clues about Hero and how he dealt with Mari, then showing what does Aubrey think about all their old friends suddenly returning and pinning the blame on her, with the limelight pointing that Basil is responsible for her problems. Then it continues with Hero living up to his namesake, showing how he is the most outwardly mature of the old group, how he still hasn't moved on from Mari.. . Basil got delegated to being a talking statue, plot device and deadweight, in that order.. . Day 1 begins with the gang finally finding out what mental trauma climbed up and died in Aubrey's, how she found some modicum of peace by moving on to new friends, and how she still cannot let go of the past. It also shows why she felt betrayed by the gang, because when your only family is an emotionally abusive mother who is catatonic and a father still finding milk for her, and when your group of friends got shattered, well, shit.. . When the limelight finally gets back to Basil, the gang walk into Basil's home where Polly tells them that Basil fucked off to the hospital for in-universe reasonable reasons. They all say "eh." and return adventuring.. . When he returns, he fucks off into his room for reasonable reasons until the plot demands that his trauma would be good for some drama. >!Then he turns Sunny into a comatose pirate.!<. . While the three friends got time and time developing them as characters, Basil is an over-glorified plot device who's main shtick is acting cute, scaredy-cat or insane and facing enough near-death experiences to majorly harm his already diminished mental capacity.. . That does not mean that he doesn't have a character. That does not mean that he is not suffering. That does not mean that the game doesn't show said suffering. I think the cute/scaredy-cat/insane switch is a very good indicator of how he is managing himself.. . But you have three teens or young adult who manage to move on from the horrid ordeal one way or another and are following you versus an NPC who has absolutely not moved on yet and freaks out every time he and Sunny end up within a 5m radius unsupervised. I personally think the former cases are more interesting than Basil's.. . This is not an attack on his character. This is a biased comment on how he is portrayed in the game, and frankly I don't see another way to do it without rewriting the game. He is never shown to be recovering because his personality and his circumstances don't allow it, and the plot *hinges* on him finally snaps. . . You don't see him accepting shit unless you go for the secret good ending, in which he smiles.. . Once.. . Implication of recovery, but not a confirmation.. . TLDR: Hero, Kel and Aubrey are portrayed closer to characters recovering from loss. They are still affected, but they try to claw their way out of their depression. Basil is a plot device first, an emotional ticking bomb second.. . The plot then shows that Basil, in his - as Cpl. Person of Generation Kill would say - infinite retardation, worsened Mari's demise by >!hanging her corpse.!< Even with the credible justification of him being a >!scared 12 years old with implications of suicidal thoughts,!< that is still fucked up and, for some, the final nail to the Basil-sized coffin destined straight to Hell. For me, it was to me once.. . Hell, I thought back then that Basil basically gets off relatively scot-free while the burden of proof falls on Sunny to explain to the gang that his case was a >!manslaughter, not a murder.!<. . As for your last paragraph, I personally don't hold much of those idea anymore. I still don't like Basil as a plot device, but as a character, I like him. I *once* thought that he should die, now I don't. In my *second playthrough* I wanted him dead, now I don't.,4
when i was 12 all of my peers had some disturbed minds. but maybe its just because of how we grew up and how i usually surrounded myself with people who, similarly, were mentally ill and puberty wasn't being nice on them we all knew how to tie a noose tbh  we also, i highly doubt that there was ever actually an autopsy done on Mari considering it'd be near impossible to actually hide her true cause of death. if there was any real investigation done, basil and sunny would be locked up immediately. so its a plothole at worst, i highly doubt it was meant to characterize basil as a criminal mastermind. cause ngl his methods are shit.,11
I say this: Children can be cruel, even more cruel than adults.,3
>!I mean your sibling didn’t die in your hands !<,2
Well like the problem is that heated family argument context is not something devoid of intent, anyone who has had a sibling has been there, if you push or strike a sibling you never mean whatever the consequence is, but you definitely want something to happen to them, deep down you truly want them to hurt in that moment. It’s certainly wrong place and wrong time, it’s quite possibly the worst case scenario that could ever happen. But Sunny can’t say he didn’t mean it, and as such, he has a very personal responsibility for it.,2
I'm pretty sure he was suicidal himself,2
A more accurate analogy would be that babies shouldn't eat the family pet alive when hungry. What he did was not normal by any means.,2
Ik that's what I mean, it seems like he doesn't care, but it's just that he's not showing how it did . . I was upset at first but ik people just process trauma different,3
[removed],1
so wasn't Sunny and he didn't hang her until basil told him,0
Yeah but again. I feel like he was basically verging turning into a complete psycho if he hadn’t already. I feel like at that point it kinda wasn’t basil anymore.,1
,102
Ik I'm one year late but I'm just laughing at you spoiler tagging what's arguably told to you when you launch the game but seeing no reason to tag the manslaughter and staged suicide plot points.,6
I personally just like sunburn more than sunflower so😹😹,23
I got the impression that Aubrey is into Sunny but not the other way around, it seemed like there was more reason to believe Sunny is into Basil imo,17
aw no really?? i really liked the thread. . it was a big analysis on basil and i guess they deleted their account or something,2
I understand what queer coding is? Don't know where the miscommunication happened there.. . But I was kinda afraid it'd be that answer. Granted he absolutely could be but I think it's odd to consider it "obvious". Being emotionally vulnerable and open to me is simply breaking a harmful masculine steortype. I dont think it should be used to determine if a character is gay,57
>pale skinned, blond haired, blue eyed, emotionally available sensitive character with traditionally feminine hobby's. . Try not to assume emotional guys are instantly LGBT+ challenge IMPOSSIBLE. . Most of what you have just listed are some of the worst kind of gay stereotypes possible. From the physical characteristics that anyone could be born with to Basil showing any level of comfort towards his male friends, it's honestly sickening as someone who has been openly gay since their teens and has lived in the 1990s.  . Omocat making the Pretty Boy comic doesn't equate every feminine guy she makes as gay, that just doesn't make sense logically.. . We have no reason to assume Basil to be gay in actuality, it's all just harmful stereotypes that people try to press onto basil and which were created by homophones to generalize gay people. The fact that you're using it to justify Basil's sexuality is laughable at best.,41
Not really? Queer coding is done to hint at a character bring gay through certain aspects about them. If those aspects are done for a character who isn't actually gay, then it's not queer coding.,2
[deleted],27
. >!Ok to preface I appreciate the fact that you don’t want to argue because I don’t either, I just want to have a discussion about him not everything has to be an argument. I wanted to say that I feel like a lot of people see the argument of him being in complete shock and not thinking rationally and do consider it but take it at face value or dismiss it to some degree. I’m not a psychologist and even I think that an entire suicide plan is still pretty weird as an impulse but I feel like it’s often underestimated how badly shock can affect you if you’ve never been in a situation like that. I won’t go into too much detail for personal reasons but I experienced a somewhat traumatic situation like that a few years ago and I feel like the shock I experienced there helped me understand him more, it’s not just that you’re shocked honestly it’s like your brain just completely blanks out and completely ignores the reality in front of you. It was mentioned in the game how even to this day he still didn’t believe Sunny was the one who killed Mari, when he came up with the fake suicide plan based off what I said earlier I don’t think he could mentally comprehend the magnitude of what he was doing beyond just protecting Sunny, of course we know how fucked up it was from a completely outside perspective but in that moment I’d say his impulse was more protect Sunny than hang Mari, with the state of shock he was in causing him to be unaware of his actual actions. Obviously I don’t think he’s innocent either it kind of bothers me when people make him out to be a cute flower boy who never did anything wrong, I see him more as an extremely mentally unstable teenager who was severely traumatised by his actions in a moment of shock. I still completely understand and respect your opinion because I felt like that for a while too, unless you try to dig really deep it really just seems that way. I wonder if there is a psychologist that’s actually analysed this game though it’d be pretty interesting (and sorry for the essay lol it wasn’t intentional)!<,12
Well congratulations! You had a WTF value of at least 8! That's rare! ,1
That’s a nice argument. Why don’t you back it up with a source?,0
full of controlling people,1
You're completely ignoring my point here. I never stated Kel was mostly in the wrong, in fact I believe it was equal part both him and Aubrey's fault. That's why it's framed similarly to their fights in Headspace when Hero finally comes in to help the two get along. All it took was some calm and collected communication, without any accusation, for them to work things out.. . As for what Kel did, you are being waaay too easy on him. First encounter in the park, he immediately assumes Kim is bullying Basil, and tells her to leave him alone despite the fact that she is walking away and trying to get him to leave her alone. Obviously Basil has a good reason to keep trying to talk to her, but it's clear that Kim wasn't escalating anything with him. Kel however, immediately assumes the worst of Kim, instantly acting hostile. He also assumes Aubrey is messing with Basil when she arrives with the rest of the Hooligans, despite the fact they just showed up. When Aubrey insults Sunny, Kel literally tells Aubrey to "watch it", and he's the first in that encounter to suggest a fight.. . Second encounter at the church, I already explained that he was not calm about asking at all. He literally immediately demands Aubrey give the photo album back in his first words to her there. When Aubrey tells her it's none of his business he actually questions why this time, but then develops it into a personal offense that it should be his business because they all used to be friends, and gets completely off topic. He's also the first to bring up Mari, and while yes Aubrey is a jerk about it, he still brings it up in front of Sunny and uses it as a low blow against Aubrey. When Aubrey explains that she's hurt they weren't there for her when Mari died, Kel actually shows some compassion towards her and tries to explain his point of view, but at the slightest resistance from Aubrey he immediately gets defensive, and preaches to her about how in the wrong she is. When Aubrey expresses that she didn't think she stole the photo album and was saving it, Kel barely questions why and asserts that he won't leave until she gives it back, which is extremely aggressive. Finally after this point he becomes reasonable again and tries to talk to Aubrey calmly, even apologizing and almost breaks through, but when Aubrey wishes to leave (clearly because she needs to process things, but it can be chalked up to Kel being a little tone deaf that he doesn't get that), he makes a huge scene in front of the church, yelling and trying to block her. The making a scene part can probably again be chalked up to Kel making a rash decision, but he still immediately drops trying to talk to Aubrey when she goes to leave, even calling her a thief. If anything this encounter was the one where he acted the worst.. . Third encounter at the lake. Now it's important to preface this one with the fact that Kel had the right to initially think Basil was in danger because of his screaming. The Hooligans were clearly expressing that they only wanted Basil to leave, but Kel clearly didn't hear by the time he and Sunny arrived on scene. However he does immediately verbally attack Aubrey, and when Kim tells him they weren't even doing anything, he instantly doesn't beleive her, and Kel makes no attempt to remove Basil from the area and just leave. After the fight, he immediately states he won't leave, and implies Aubrey has become a horrible person. And yes, she's become a bully and a gang member, but that's not how you stop hostility with someone. He also brings up Mari as a low blow again, and then argues with her right back that she must still care about them, which at first seems noble, but it's a bit of a dick thing to do in front of Aubrey's friends. He also for some reason completely forgets about Basil during this part. When Aubrey actually starts crying and having a mental breakdown, and the rest of the Hooligans have already left, he still isn't deferred from arguing with her.. . I get that Aubrey's a huge jerk throughout all of this and I fully agree, and you can even argue Kel was justified in some of his actions, but the fact of the matter remains that he did very little to diffuse any of these situations. He is just as much as responsible for the fights as Aubrey is.,1
OK, hold up.. Aubrey made it clear in the church that Basil wasn't telling Kel the truth. She may not have explicitly told him what happened, but that's only because Kel dismissed her.. . "Is *that* what Basil told you? I'm the one keeping it safe!". . "What are you talking about? That photo album belongs to Basil, and I'm not leaving till you promise to give it back to him!". . So no, Kel didn't even TRY to understand her side of the situation, nor did he care. The only reason he even knew why she was there in the first place is because *she* told *him* that on her own. . . . And what the hell are you talking about??? Kim explicitly told Kel they didn't do anything to Basil multiple times, and that he "just started screaming" out of nowhere. What else could she have possibly said? And guess what? Kel refused to believe her, and antagonized them to the point where they got into yet *another* fight. . . And guess what else? Basil made NO attempt to break up the fight and explain that nothing happened (and we know for a fact that he stood there and watched, because he was already done crying by the time the fight was over).,1
The game does not empathize with others more than Basil, it can be argued that it does actually more of the opposite and shows a lot more empathy towards him than Kel, Aubrey and Hero, who aren't in the state of terror Basil. Saying that the game shows more sympathy for the other friends isn't surface level at all, it's completely wrong and can only be seen so, if you ignore Basil's character or struggles. It's like with Avatar fans saying that Zuko is only a character on a redemption arc, or saying that Joseph Joestar from JoJo is just a goofball. It doesn't make sense. . . Basil's characterization of Headspace is the first we see of him and is the basis of how we perceive him. It's a reflection of Sunny's memory of Basil and how he was and still is. That is why first time players hated Aubrey and were pissed off by her so much, because of this characterization that later isn't contradicted in memory lane. Likewise with Kel, he is portrayed as being reckless and mean is also contradicted by the real life Kel later on and shows us that he is more complex than one might think. Headspace being just a dream is equally reductive and narrow-minded, it is the place where Sunny's perspective of the world is shown and a way for him to cope with what happened and not all it in it is superficial. Headspace makes up for most of the game, and there is a whole route where you spend even more time in it and where we interact with the characters, it is a very crucial place for us the player to understand our characters. Hardly just biases. . . Basil himself is OFTEN shown in the story, in almost every plot-relevant scenes of the game and his presence is always the one that is the most relevant, as he is the closest person other than Sunny to the biggest twist. He himself is more shown than Hero and even Aubrey on the first day outside and afterwards, and you get to see Basil more than enough to really get him and why he is the center of the plot. Remember that we meet Basil after we retrieve the Photo Album and how he reacts to everything and Polly mentioning us how Basil's parents aren't around often? You get more piece of information about him than any other character: . . His parents are often absent, he and his caretaker aren't close due to his shyness, and he is both scared of Sunny and of the prospect to lose him, and you do get the sense that something happened between them (If you interpreted it as threatening, you have no idea what a real threat is, it's a cry for help and the majority understood it). Basil gets more characterization than anyone here, including Kel, who might be your only party member, he himself is not as relevant to the overall story as Basil, since his job is merely pointing you the direction and helping you, but the one who is mostly in focus is Basil himself, you are doing things for him. Aubrey is more of a villain and her motives are not explained by her well at all, only until much later after she wants to redeem herself.  THIS is just the first day. The second day has us overcome a fear for Basil and though brief, his words are some of the most important ones in the story: Sunny, there is no way out of this. The third day doesn't need to be explained, the twist, the fight, the encouraging words, the Memory lane scene, the duet and the ending is enough to show us what Basil really is by this point and I don't need to mention it, it is obvious after all. He is no talking statue, he is an important character who moves the plot and is one of the most important architects of all our struggles and still our closest friend in pain, but due to our inability to face reality, we let him suffer for too long until we see the consequences of our actions. Just because a character isn't playable, they aren't simply dolls or statues. Everyone plays different roles, unless you think all NPC's are trash. . . How much a character is shown also has no bearings on their impact on it, as each character is different and so are their roles. Basil is more of a Damsel in distress-type of character and while they aren't all present (Basil is always present and shown in the story, he is in more cutscenes than anyone other than Sunny, which makes him more unique than characters from the same archetype as Peach or Zelda), they don't have to be, they are the person you care the most for and the search, as well as the reunion with them, is what matters. So even if you are correct that you barely see him, that doesn't erase the moments we see him or the impact he had. This isn't really a good criticism at all, and the summary of the real world segments are just biased points that aren't really that well reflected, as I have pointed out. . . Your entire problem with him can be boiled down to not paying attention to his lines of dialogue and his characterization due to you not really liking the character, which is why you overuse the word "fuck-off" for every time he disappears (which is revolting, and the reasonable part feels like damage control) and have issues with him not moving on, when he 1.DID move in the final cutscene you get for caring about him enough, since he genuinely smiled warmly back at Sunny and shows real happiness after what happened and 2. Ignored, surprisingly, how no one moved on at all throughout the story: Kel feels lonely without his old friends and feels guilty of not having been there for them enough, Aubrey alienated her old friends because she refused to understand what they had to go through, Hero is still sad over what happened with Mari and feels like a failure as he is the oldest and should have known better. Sunny and Basil did not move on, precisely because they played an important role in the incident that haunts them and THAT is something very hard to move on, much harder than anything Kel, Aubrey and Hero had to go through, which completely debases your assumption of these 3 having been better explored or their sorrow being more empathized. You couldn't empathize with Basil's problems and didn't care about him, which isn't a bad thing, but where I draw the line is misinterpreting the story and insulting people with such trauma, because his motives are explained more empathically than Aubrey's who comes across as more of a jerk than Basil.. . At least you admitted that this is merely your biased opinion and not a fact, and that you changed your view of the Bad ending, because Sunny's and Basil's suffering is not something that should be enjoyed unironically,3
Sorry to hear that my guy, I hope you and your people are doing fine. . And yeah this whole investigation thing is a "suspension of disbelief" kinda deal, either you believe that the investigators were incompetent af or not even present or Basil actually did know very well what he was doing (it still wouldn't make any sense how would hide the bruises on Mari's body from her fall),0
Sounds like a Metal Gear Rising reference,3
Wellll yes he meant to push her.. not to kill her.,1
I considered that too, but why would he be, before the accident? He seemed content, surrounded by supportive friends. He even said ”What would I wish for? I have everything I could want right here.” but it’s not completely impossible.,1
,1
That's because he was an emotional wreck after accidentally killing his sister and probably wouldn't have thought to do anything on his own.,2

Lol, a year passed already? Sheesh. I'll admit i didnt catch onto the hints in the game lauch, but i'll agree that looking back, it is kinda funny that i tagged one thing and not the other haha,2
Spoiler warning but >!in one of the memories in memory lane, going to view Basil’s picture upon interacting with him prompts him to ask if Sunny has a crush on Aubrey and Sunny’s ears turn red.!<,53
I mean, if Aubrey loves him in his ideal headspace... ,45
I mean, fuck, i do find him real cute, but I have no reason to actually believe he's gay. That's just pure toxic and stereotypical,5
IMHO, just because it's based on harmful stereotypes doesn't mean it's not happening. Social coding will always be dependent on what the majority understands and perceives. If most players perceive Basil as a gay boy (btw I'm not sure this is the case, just hypothesizing) because of his feminine traits and emotional personality, then that would configure him as a queer-coded character.. . Yeah, that's not ideal, and we should push against toxic stereotypes, but, alas, that's my opinion. :>,19
[deleted],28
Fuck off, he's gay af. You're just weaponizing homophobia to be homophobic and erase his queerness,-12
You may live to see manmade horrors beyond comprehension. . ,1
Not necessarly, queer coding can be done unnitentionnaly by the creator, especially if it's rooted in bigotry, like lots of older Disney villains have queer connotations, but where not written to be queer.,2
Queer coding has a super long history of being used not just to hint at a character's sexuality, but to give them particular visible traits in order to hint at other invisible traits. Disney queer codes most of their villains, though none of them are outright being shown to be hyper feminine, flamboyant, or gay in any actual way. Gaston is even confirmed by designers to be queer coded, though he's explicitly straight, per the narrative, but that attempt at hyper masculinity and constant over-compensation was seen, at the time, as a gay trait. It has some of its roots in the Hayes code from early Hollywood, when it was against the code to display overt queerness in media. . . [Here's a good and quick video on it](). The definition up front even explains that it doesn't have to be explicit, and that it doesn't have to actually imply they're gay.,2
Not sure if you meant that using he/him pronouns rules out being non-binary, but many non-binary people use pronouns other than they/them like only he/him or she/her, or even a mix of he/she, or he/she/they. But yeah, I think its pretty unimportant in the story overall other than to add onto the bullying/isolation of Basil.,-2
You can find at least one "psychologist plays Omori" playthroughs on YouTube. It's interesting to get their take on it.,5
[ (first result after searching "undertale murder attempt"). . [(first result after searching "undertale markiplier death threats"). . [ (description used to say "please stop sending me death threats over this animation"). . [ (3rd result after searching "undertale fandom toxicity towards matpat"). This one doesn't explicitly state "death threats", but at the very least the first 2 should make this clear enough.. . Note that this was the Undertale fandom at it's peak in roughly 2016. It has since calmed down from there and is not nearly as toxic as it once was. My point here is that there are very, \*very\* few fandoms that go as far as to have someone actually attempt murder and have this many death threats sent to people. Hopefully no other fandom will ever actually get to the level that Undertale was at with regards to toxicity.,5
Oh,1
Here is the thing: Aubrey didn't explained herself at all, she didn't told them what happened, so of course no one would understand her, especiallywhen Kel asked her multiple time why Basil did to her and yet no answer comes. Besides the fact that what Basil did doesn't warrant her thievery at all, which is the actual reason why she didn't even said anything;it was wrong and she knew it, not because she was dismissed. A stubborn person like Aubrey would not be incapable of being upfront, but since she did something bad, it's hard to justify it. . . Kel didn't need to understand this, because the Photo Album belongs to Basil and not her, even Hero didn' tgot the explanation from Aubrey until much later, though he was a bit more empathetic and had Kel been a little less harsh to her, they would have made up much earlier. This part I agree with, but the blame lies on Aubrey mostly. . . Kim punched Basil the other day and wanted to throw him out of public space. She has no right to act like an innocent girl at all. She should have just said we won't do anything bad to Basil, but she didn't, because she gives a damn about him. The fact that she started a fight with Kel is proof that they have not the best interest at heart for Basil. . . Wasn't Basil still crying until Aubrey had her whole rant how everyone is terrible and abandoned Mari? Even if not, it is not up to Basil to explain it, since the Photo Album is his property and saying now what exactly happened is not the best time. Besides the fact he made many attempts to explain himself to Aubrey with her scoffing him off brutally, I think that Aubrey is at the very least 80-90% responsible for all of the fights, all of them started by her.,2
I remember hearing somewhere that in Asian communities, having a family member commit suicide is like a really dishonourable thing to the family name. Under the assumption that sunnys family are Asian American, then they may not have opened a police investigation into what happened. Not trying to like enforce stereotypes or whatever, just thought that it may help cover up that plot hole (if what I heard is true and isn’t bs),1
When did they said this?,1
No sibling even wishes to kill another. By pushing with intent to harm, losing himself in his anger, he invited the possibility into existence irresponsibly. The simple fact that he knows that there was an intent deep down is the real problem, because he can’t just say “it was some dumb accident”. He’s a murderer.,1
Because I wish having good friends could cure depression. Sometimes depression is just a bitch and won't leave even if you have everything you want.. . Also, you can't tell me he isn't affected by his parents practically abandoning him. He just strikes me as clinically anxious and depressed so I wouldn't be surprised if he was suicidal. Or even obsessed woth the thought of suicide. But that might be me overprojecting so yeah. Theories be just that.,1
so he controlled Sunny into hanging her so no one blames them,0

Two years from the original comment and I was thinking the same thing,1
The same goes for Basil tho lol. . Maybe he wants both of them ,31
Fax,8
I agree people will believe what they want, but I think the game itself pretty obviously gives no actual evidence of Basil's sexuality. People can try to legitimize their headcanons with random evidence that has no logical basis behind it other than what other people might believe, but in the end it's no more credible than horoscopes. Just pseudoscience.,4
I was never accusing you of being homophobic, and I never meant it to be interpreted that way.  . I'm accusing you of using bad stereotypes of gay people that misrepresent what a gay person is in order to justify Basil's sexuality, which is naive but not homophobic.  . You can relate to Basil in any way you want, but I take issue with anyone declaring Basil to be gay in form except your headcanons. Omocat very intentionally left sexuality out of her game and focused on friendships instead because otherwise it would distract from Omori's actual meaning. Hero and Mari are a great example, because we don't actually know if they were dating or not. They could have just been close friends that had feelings for each other. I think Omocat designed her story like that for a reason.  . Sunny and Hero's sexuality are the only ones we can infer, but even those are contested. I only wish people stop projecting sexuality onto characters like it's fact.,-2
[I encourage you to study up on LGBT+ stereotypes](), otherwise you come off as super ignorant and no one is even able to understand you, let alone pay attention to you.,10
wtf are you on?,5

I’ll have a look thank you!,2
Sundowner says something like that right before you fight him,2
[I agree with most of that except the last part]. Jesus dude he’s a kid- He couldn’t have thought of all of the consequences in those few seconds.,1
Oh yeah I know that, I have it myself. I just personally didn’t notice any signs of it in Basil. But of course he’s affected by his parents leaving. . . I believe he definitely has some sort of anxiety, though. The game is great at portraying that imo.,1
So no one blames *Sunny.* Basil was just trying to help, as he himself would gladly take the blame, like how he did for blacking out the photos of Mari when that was actually Sunny's doing.,1

Yeah, it tickled me, so I left it up as is 😅,1
Sunny’s getting all the.. gender neutral maidens,3
[deleted],6
Ok but Hero and Mari were definitely dating, and Sunny is outright stated to have a crush on Aubrey. Sexuality is mostly left out but romantic relationships still exist. I agree that the stereotypes used to determine Basil as gay are harmful though.,8
Everyone starts somewhere, and learning about the community is challenging if you arent apart of it yourself, so dont sweat it as long as youre trying :). . Though I will say that most trans people dont want someone without permission to say their deadname. I know its just online, and I probably wont ever know Emma, but the idea is that I would never need to know Emma’s deadname, so why say it yknow?,2
Thought it was from lego batman but, works both ways,1
His just a kid, and yes, just like Basil, he was definitely not imagining the consequences. That doesn’t make him not responsible. And I’d like to point out, I’m speaking from trying to get into his mind. It is harsh to call him a murderer as a twelve year old, but that’s what he thinks he is. That is what eats away at him and Basil and needs to be hidden away.,2
Shows how much interpretations vary from people to people haha,2
AND CREATING SOMETHING AND HIDING THE TRUTH IS TRYING TO HELP?,0

>I never stated it was a fact,. . No but you implied it a few times.  . . . >**but I do think Omocat was SAYING it without saying it,** and of course lgbt kids aren't exactly the popular kids at school. . Which is really what I was stating with the words “like it’s fact”   . I appreciate that you did clarified it as personal interpretation several times in your original post, but I’m really just taking issue with the stereotypes you’re using to justify Basil’s sexuality. You’re welcome to continue believing what your believe as much as I’m welcome to criticize it. No hate, I just needed to push back on those points.,1
If Omocat came out and said "Hero and Mari aren't dating" then that would be the fact of the matter, nothing in the game contradicts that idea because their type of relationship is never explicitly stated, only assumed to be.   . That's what I mean by "we don't know if they are dating or not". We assume they are dating because it's the most likely scenario, but it's not so established by the story that a simple statement from the author wouldn't throw it out the window.  . The same with Sunny actually, since he's young if the Author made an explicit statement about their sexuality than that would be fact because everything else that indicates a crush on Aubrey could be assumed to be something else.   . This was by design because the game wasn't meant to be about romantic relationships (although it definitely has romance aspects such as sweetheart), it almost always focused on friendships.,1
Yep,1
Yes. Emphasis on *trying,* but still. As misguided and ultimately disastrous as Basil's actions may have been, they were still taken selflessly, with Sunny's best interests in mind.,1

JK Rowling made tons of Harry Potter retcons, doesn't mean they actually make sense in canon.. . Doesn't Mari literally mention that she doesn't like Hero for his charm, and that it'd "ruin the magic" if she told him? It's not explicitly stated because it doesn't have to be, they have a very clearly defined romantic relationship, at least from what Sunny portrays of it in his mind.. . There's also literally a Blackspace 2 event that shows Sunny clearly has a crush on Aubrey still, ridiculous as it is that's the most solid evidence that he still likes Aubrey.. . I agree that romance isn't the main focus of the game and rather close friendships, but there are still very clearly romantic relationships too.,3

ok, the next time a friend needs help, im hanging their sister,1

JK Rowling retcons are a different matter, entirely. Many of them change the actual story, which is different from Omocat clarifying the story.   . . . The conversation you're referencing is: "You know I only have eyes for you, MARI..." "HERO! That's not what I like about you at all!" "What? It's not? Then what is it?" "can't tell you that, silly! It would ruin the magic!"  . It started off as romantic but then became inquisitive. Again, there are romantic aspects of this game but Mari and Hero's relationship is not explicitly romantic. Hero has feelings for Mari and Mari has feelings for Hero but their relationship has never been defined by the game, we define it as dating because it makes sense but if Omocat ever clarified then that would change everything because we simply don't have enough information to say for certain that they are dating. We just know they have feelings for each other and they express those feelings sometimes, but that's not the same as having a romantic relationship with someone.  . The anime Aubrey battle is obviously showing Sunny's crush on Aubrey, but again, he's a kid and kids have tons of crushes. I've had crushes on girls as a kid, but they were just that: crushes. They didn't define my sexuality.,0
Oof, links don't work that's a shame...  . As I have said, you can draw a conclusion about Mari and Hero's relationship but no conclusion has been proven other than they are close friends. Any conclusion you come up with about the nature of their relationship is, by definition, your own opinion. It has no actual foundation other than your own interpretation, which means nothing if Omocat were to actually clarify their relationship because their relationship is open to interpretation. It is most likely the case that they are dating, but my whole point is that the story intentionally doesn't define their relationship unequivocally and the reason why is because the story doesn't want us to focus on that part of the game. The only part of their relationship that is defined is their friendship, and that's because the game wants us to focus on that fact.,1
You're missing the point. I'm not saying Basil framing Mari's death as a suicide was the right thing to do, I'm just saying it's at least somewhat understandable that Basil chose to take that course of action given the circumstances, and it seems kind of unfair to hold it against Basil given that he both meant well and was clearly not of sound mind at the time that it happened.,2

Ok at this point I feel like you're just intentionally ignoring it. I don't know how you read those lines and think they don't have something going on lmfao. There's tons more hints in how they speak to each other, I shouldn't have to do a full analysis for you. If anything it shows how great Omocat is at writing these characters that it's made so obvious they love each other without their relationship being explicitly stated. I'm sorry but denying it is just ridiculous.. . Blackspace isn't Headspace though, it still accurately reflects Sunny's current mind.. . Uh... what? Dude if you have a crush on a girl that means you're romantically attracted to her, which means you like girls. There's still room for asexuality or being bi/pan but you clearly are attracted to girls at the very least.,4

I think you just have a really bad understanding of sexuality, puberty and how consensual relationships work which isn't surprising from a redditor but still a little off putting.. . I encourage you to read up on [consent](), [intimate relationships]() and [sexuality]()/puberty, not just for your sake but also anyone you date in the future. I don't have a link for puberty because its usually something most people understand by adulthood, but you can google around.,0

Wow, way to suddenly just stoop to patronizing. Fine then, personally I think you're being intentionally obtuse and blind to how relationships work. It's to the point that I'm starting to wonder if you're aroace because you are completely blind to a lot of signs. But that's not an argument is it, that's just accusations.. . Don't just tell me that I'm wrong, don't just tell me that's not how it works. I can't argue against anything that way, and sending me definitions isn't going to work either because I already know all of that and still beleive I'm right.,4

>Wow, way to suddenly just stoop to patronizing.. . But also. . >**I feel like you're just intentionally ignoring it.** I don't know how you read those lines and think they don't have something going on lmfao. **denying it is just ridiculous.**. . You also disliked all my posts lol. I don't know if this is your first time on the internet but if you're going to fling sh\*t at someone they're going to fling it back at you. I just happen to fling it back a little harder. Rules of the internet bruv.... . >Don't just tell me that I'm wrong, don't just tell me that's not how it works.. . I gave you 2 wikipedia pages (which are more than definitions) and one page defining consent because it seems like you don't know what consensual relationships are. It's not my job to educate you, but for your sake and any future partners you have I guess I will attempt to do so.. . A relationship is a two way street, but only if you know it's there. If you assume there is a two way street without the other person knowing, then you're just walking on a one-way street and you're going to get hit by a car. If you want to be in a romantic relationship with a person, you must define your relationship as that and have a conversation about boundaries. Otherwise you confuse the hell out of the other person and are likely to break their boundaries.  . It is never implied, expressed, or imagined (by Sunny) that Hero or Mari had a conversation about their relationship or defined it in anyway as romantic. It just never happened afaik so you cannot declare they have a romantic relationship, only that they are intimate with each other sometimes. Intimacy in a relationship doesn't mean a relationship is romantic, platonic relationships can be intimate. For example, never assume a person who compliments you is interested in you romantically, that's just not healthy. Have a conversation about your feelings, and decide with your partner if the relationship should change to romantic. Then, and only then, should you say you have a romantic relationship. Do not assume you have a romantic relationship without the other persons expressed consent.,0

\*,2
??? Again really failing how you're seeing that first part as the same thing as you, literally trying to give me definitions (ok fine, wikipedia pages, but that's not much better) without any explanation. You're acting ridiculous. I started down voting you when you started making no sense, because I felt like it. It's not that big a deal.. . ????? Dude, neither of us are Hero and Mari, nor do we ever see the game through their eyes. It isn't our business to know their defined boundaries. It isn't our business to fully know if they've actually consented to a romantic relationship. *We are not in on the relationship.* All we can go off of is how they act around each other in public and within their friend group, where conversation that intimate obviously is not going to happen. This has nothing to do with consent, it's just reading people, and they're written with tons of detail to make it seem like they're romantically involved.. . Intimacy is not the same thing as compliments, I never implied that in that slightest. The quote I gave clearly defined them as having a "magic" between them. You even admitted Hero's quote right before about only having eyes for Mari is clearly romantic, yet because Mari manages to tease Hero back it suddenly isn't? Your logic is extremely backwards.,3
,3
>It isn't our business to know their defined boundaries.. . If you have two friends who are intimate with each other and you assume they are dating, then you are setting yourself up for disaster.  . a) if you're wrong you're going to cause both parties to become uncomfortable.  . b) you're making assumptions based on things you don't fully understand.  . I don't know how else to tell you that. If you think you're somehow so special that you can divine the definition of someones relationship with another person, that's great you feel that confident but in the end you're just assuming. You don't know the answer, you're just making up your own answer which are subject to bias (lack of context, projection, etc...) that can and will dilute it from the truth. You always ask someones relationship with a person, you don't assume it. We cannot ask Hero's relationship with Mari, so we cannot know for certain what that relationship was. We can only do our best to interpret it from what little information we have. If you still can't understand this, I cannot educate you further. This is something you have to go out into the real world and discover for yourself.. . >Intimacy is not the same thing as compliments, I never implied that in that slightest.. . You implied that Hero and Mari making intimate compliments to each other was indicative of their romantic relationship, as you say: "having a magic between them". I agreed that Hero's first comment was romantic in nature, but ultimately it was a compliment towards Mari which meant "you're the best person in my eyes" essentially. If you don't know how conversations work and you think a single romantically implied comment means the conversation is romantic overall then I think I'm done with this. For someone who thinks they can divine the nature of peoples relationships by simply watching them, and then to have such a lack of understanding of how conversations transition from one part to the next, I think you're actually a troll. Bravo to you for setting up a convincing bait, but really this talk is just a waste of time for me.,0

Goddamn how in denial are you? Obviously if I assume in real life if two friends are dating without asking, there's room for error. However at most that's gonna lead to a slightly awkward correction and that's it, it's not that big a deal and definitely not "setting myself up for disaster".. . That doesn't change the fact however that romance is pretty easy to read, and it really isn't subtle in Hero's and Mari's relationship. In reality if you assumed you'd probably be right, but sure you should double check. This isn't real life though, they're fictional characters that we can't actually ask, as you mentioned, but it's again something that's extremely implied by the writing. You are literally ignoring an obvious theme because it technically has room to subvert expectations. Why at all would their relationship and intimacy be so focused, to the point where Hero makes a romantic compliment, to the point where Mari says they have a "magic", to the point where all that's said after Mari asks if Hero would've said yes to marrying Sweetheart with a distinct interest. They are very clearly romantically involved, whether officially togethet or just interested in each other, but the game goes out of its way to show how intimate and caring they are for each other, on top of actual flirting. No one is that intimate with someone they aren't interested in. Not to mention, Headspace Hero and Mari are 15 while the rest of the group is 12, its possible they are dating but just didn't think to mention it to the friends. After all Kel still believes in cooties. . . >If you don't know how conversations work and you think a single romantically implied comment means the conversation is romantic overall then I think I'm done with this.. . That is not at all what I did in the slightest, and your one-sided view here is just proof of how you're intentionally not looking into the details of Hero and Mari's writing. I not once said that only Hero's compliment made the conversation romantic, I actually analyzed it. I point out how Mari teased him afterwards and made Hero flustered, how Mari clearly saw and stated with that "magic" comment what was between them as special and more than just friendship. And I'm sorry you're just straight up lying about the meaning behind Hero's flirting line. "Only have eyes for you" is an inherently romantic line used to say that you are only romantically interested in that person.,2

You know what? You've convinced me actually and I relinquish all my past arguments. You are correct and I apologize for my rude behaviour.Since you seem to know a romantic relationship so well, even better than me, could I ask for your help?You see I have this girl friend, who I think is such a lovely person. She comes from out of state, but whenever we hang out we always give each other kisses. We often watch netflix together and she loves to watch romantic movies with me. 2 weeks ago she fell asleep on my shoulder during a movie. Are we basically dating at this point? Have we developed feelings for each other? I'm very confused so could you please tell me what's going on? You seem to know so much more about this stuff than me.,0
NOW THIS COMES FROM INSIDE,1
[removed],1
👁️im still watching you,3
It's kinda weird how mad you're getting about this, but I'll humor you.. . You guys are not officially dating, no. You haven't discussed it with her. However if you're at the point where you're literally kissing each other It's pretty clear you two have developed feelings and for some reason or another you haven't actually made it official.. . And before you come after me about how this proves you're right and consent and blah blah, your example is completely irrelevant from the topic at hand. I have made it explicitly clear that looking as an outsider into a relationship between two characters is not the same as being in that relationship nor even playing a character in that relationship.,2
Ok I was watching the game again and found this so if you somehow still don't think it's obvious Hero and Mari were romantically involved, Basil literally calls them "a match made in heaven" in one of the photos.,1
Wrong community,1

At this point we should exchange discords lol,2
As I've said before, the problem is that you have either misunderstood this entire conversation from start to finish, or your too young to actually know the difference between a theory and a fact.Until I know which of these is the case, we'll never be able to resolve this matter. What's more, I don't really care to resolve it since doing so would be a huge waste of time for something that you either already agree with but have somehow misunderstood from the beginning, or something you'll eventually come to understand as you get older.  . Also, a bystander (like Basil) should not determine a relationship. They can observe it, and give their opinion on it (like Basil did) but ultimately Basil doesn't get to decide if Mari and Hero are dating.,1

Lmfao this was never about the difference between theory and fact, and was about you trying to deny that Omocat even tried to imply Mari and Hero were in a romantic relationship through her writing.. . >Also, a bystander (like Basil) should not determine a relationship.. . Oh use some context clues for once. If Basil is calling them a couple in the photo album all his friends get to see I think it's obvious everyone knows they're a couple.,1

Sounds like a place where Two Hero's Theory believers can live in harmony ,2
 I'm honestly not surprised to see you summarize our conversation in such a simple and misleading manner. It proves that you really are too young or too confused to have this conversation so I would prefer not to waste my time having it for a second time.  . . . >Oh use some context clues for once.. . I could say the same to you. Just because a friend thinks two people look cute together doesn't mean those two people are friends, dating, married or whatever. Seeing a comment on an insta post "you two look like a couple" doesn't mean the two people are a couple. That's just a bystanders opinion- a theory. The fact is that the bystander has no idea.  . Perhaps Mari and Hero are dating, and Basil is saying "A match made in heaven" with that in mind. Or maybe they're just really close friends because Hero and Mari don't want to come out as dating to their parents and Basil is just saying how heavenly they look in the photo.  . . . I could come up with countless theories that explain in great detail Mari and Hero's relationship as purely friendship, but personally I'm a HeroXMari shipper so it would be a waste of time.   . . . You should stop putting your time into this conversation. Go out and experience life, get in a few relationships and come back when you're at least 25. I think by that point you can probably understand what I've been trying to say to you.,0

Holy fucking shit. Ok first off, it got autocorrected from "up" to "you", but second off either way it's common phrase and there's is absolutely no reason to be this pettily condescending.

I only have two theories about you, the ones I have already stated, and only one of them casts you in a negative way. I also lack experience in different ways. Why you think lacking experience on a subject would make you less than me is something I will never understand.  .    . I asked a simple clarifying question because it seemed like you were bothered by how this ended. Fortunately, it seems to be an auto-correct mistake so all's well that ends well.,1

i. yeah. it boiled over.,190
Hero said to **observe**. . Never to warn. . Sunny only followed orders,185
My headcanon is that in the Omori universe Hero has a cooking show on YouTube called "Hungry With Hero" where he recreates foods from popular movies and TV shows. But he still has hair, don't worry,160
I mean he did his job... Great art!,53
Pretty much my level of helpfulness in the kitchen.,47
ok but fr what are you supposed to do when it overflows. im genuinely clueless,33
Like They Say He Would Not Notice Anything,30
Just like zoologists spectating the animal world!,28
good job sunny,24
I love this image so much,13
Sunny watching his mental health crumble,12
I mean, he ***did*** watch the pot,11
I love this, very accurate,11
Do you take commissions,9
Yeah this captures Sunny’s personality perfectly,10
pinoy kids when their yaya asks them to watch the rice,7
Now sunny has to spend hours cleaning that stove.,7
Yo Snuflin I've seen your name and comics on a youtube vid once. One where Sunny just does this with his hand ✌ and he just disappears sorry ahem other then that this comic is funny and cute.,6
Well I mean, he didn't /not/ watch the pot,6
I love how these comics even look like the omori cutscenes, these are the blessing this subreddit needs,5
This is so adorable, your style is too gorgeous! ♥️,5
It was rice, wasn't it?,5
it do be like that sometimes,5
And now the entire house is flooded with boiling water,6
i mean, he did exact what hero told him to do lel,4
sunny no. . don't overflow the cum pot,12
Canon even without kel,3
Canon post ending,3
Good pot…,3
Omori knows how to cook, ask him how to cook a steak 🥱,3
well he did watch it,3
Source?,2
I had to burst in while this was happening and turn off the pot, lets just say Hero got a bit mad at Sunny for that...,2
At least he would be good at cutting the vegetables.,2
Must be rice,2
I mean, he watched the pot tho,2
he did say to watch it, not to stop it from getting out of control,1
so perfect it makes you vomit <3,342
Step 1: get steak. Step 2: put in freezer,93
exactly as told,221
Following the direct instructions of Omori who lives for **chaos**,95
Omori is my favourite slice of life anime,42
Good soldiers follow orders,59
This image reminds me of Asriel following the pie recipe exactly as he interpreted it!,3
that’s... beautiful,64
i would WATCH THAT. . like sunny watched the pot,50
Ironic how similar it sounds to Hungry Humphrey. . Sunny will probably remember it for that,31
Did you by any chance read the fanfic Playing Hero?,10
we panicked, moved the pot, and threw down a towel, but forgot to turn the stove off so it didn’t end well.,26
I think the best you can do at that point is to turn the heat off so it doesn't boil over more.,19
just throw a whole fucking cat in that shit they love milk let them drink it enough to make sure it doesnt overflow, and then remove them like a minute later. . &#x200B;. . happy to help,11
Sorry, I’m still very new to drawing so I wouldn’t be comfortable. Maybe in the future?,10
Correction, Hero has to spend hours cleaning that stove.,11
thank you. It doesn’t bother me much as long as they link back to my Reddit/Tumblr, but I’m probably going to start adding my username.,5
irl it was chicken,6
sorry, i might be misunderstanding your question but i made this.,3
It’s just part of the recipe,178
step 3: microwave steak. . step 4: salmonella,84
Omori and Sunny are just the "THE SOULD OF THE INNOCENT. A Bagel." Meme,37
Truue,7
Good soldiers follow orders,21
What is it about?,5
Cats cant digest milk,3
its the future, do you take commissions?,7
Ah alrighty and hope your having a good day . Your name reminds me of someone in Moomin Valley name Snufkin,5
Thanks!,3
The Nausea brings out the flavor,56

Step 7: “MY LUNGS A WHEEZIN”,35
Step 8: THE FUCKING WALLS ARE MELTING,30
Step 9: “I CAN HEAR SATAN’S VOICE! HE’S TELLING ME TO- *INVEST IN APPLE?* **WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???** ***WHY DOES HE WANT ME TO BUY APPLES???????***”,28
I miss him :(,14
WHY DID SAM O NELLA LEAVE,12
NOOOOOO NOT AUBREEEEEEYYYYYYY,347
we do a little trolling,213

I need to ask, but what have they done to get in tmodloader? It's mainly the elements we're horny about.,10

Because I think she’d like slaughtering enemies in Terraria, and even more with mods like the one you referenced.,5

No, the circuits can still be reconnected. We need to bury this thing in the Boston Harbor.,36
GRAB THE TRUCK,10
I'm too used to Omocat sharing upsetting artwork/memes, I kept looking for a trick with this one.,476
Seeing Basil and Aubrey so happy together makes what happens in the future all the more tragic.,146
little does Basil know that this nice, friendly girl will be >!beating his ass on the daily only 4 years later!<,168
basil looks like a geicopathway,83
looks like we've found a new image to worship,139
Aww.. Well,that's cute.,48
oh my god thats adorable,25
Awww, Basil is so fucking cute when he makes his *I'm thinking about all the ways I could hide your corpse* face,46
Basil is like a psycopath with that face,59
Brazil's smile has some Chara vives. I guess it's intended.,18
Basil became part of the friend group. . ...but at what cost,13
As long as Aubrey is happy I'm happy.... But idk about Basil,19
This is so cute, i love OMOCAT art style,10
This makes the present even more sad because she was the one who introduced him to the friend group in the first place,10
FIREFLOWER REAL????????????,12
cute 😊,6
What nice art,6
bagel and auby <3,5
Everytime omocat tweets something, everyone instantly rushes to reddit so they can karmawhore the crap out of her tweet,6
Aubey,6
awww!!,5
It's so cute :) this is just extremely adorable,4
I keep forgetting Basil's a boy 😅,3
One of two options: they became friends again or Sunny was left without a girlfriend.,5
[deleted],-3
Deport basil but gawd this is cute af,-9
So Basil is straight or gay?,-8
It's obvious that they were great friends in the past.,1
It’s more just sorta bittersweet really. Seeing what used to be and now isn’t.,241
Well, Basil’s left hand looks deformed, if that counts for anything.,129
What about polly tho? That one had no tricks,19
Basil looks like he has seen some shit.,46
I guess this makes "please forgive me" hit way harder so...thats something,12
Wait when does that happen?,7
I'm dumb, thought that was Mari, down voted myself cuz I deserve it,12
Hope you do well!,29
Hope you do well!,11

Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),5
:D,5
It’s just them being friendos,6
man really just said “I deport this character” and got downvoted. 1984,14
Deport him???? What do you mean??,13
Basil gang will come and beat you up now,7
Both I guess,15
Well, there are some people who swing both ways.,11
Why must people assume that everything is ship art.,10
its the word "OMO",86
Man's been in ground zero of a missile detonation.,8
It's Aubrey not Mari.,19
,13
r/suddenlybillwurtz,33
No, don't.,13
\*cyclepath,51
Yea sorry...,11
:DD,4
Reality can be cruel.,5
Deport him for hate crimes against Bulgarians?,8
You were right about that,7
Yes,5
Hmmm, at least its a conclusion,3
It's a fandom, always are some toxicity. Even in fact that in omori all the characters are beginning puberty, everyone whant a ship in their respective,3
That's why Omocat is trolling,3
Pffft- oh my god you’re right-,15
He has become death, destroyer of worlds…,6
I am a dumb, didn't see bow,12
,5
Oh yeah,my mistake 😖,8
Don't apologize,3
When you got two mouths,4
Dude,, she’s not even trolling,, this is just cute art of some friends. I doubt it’s even ship bait. It’s normal for friends to hold hands. Again, why do people assume everything is ship art,10
It's fine. We all make mistakes.,6
BAHAHAHAHA,2
Thanks to be clear,2
Ness Paula Jeff Poo  . Kris Susie Ralsei Lancer  . Omori Aubrey Kel Hero,260
I feel like Susie and Aubry would be besties omg I love this,230
DELTARUNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. . i have no idea wtf Omori is i came here for the deltarune and well yeah,62
thats really cool,41
Wait, Kris is using flirt on the party. Based?,38
Tbh, the Deltarune gang feel like they can almost be one-to-one parallels for the party in OMORI.. . Kris is Omori, Aubrey is Susie, Lancer is Kel, and Ralsei is Hero. Maybe Asriel could be Mari, in this scenario, and Noelle would be Basil?,32
I had idea like this and finally someone made it! cool art,20
Lancer secretly has a gun as his weapon,17
Forgot to mention: thanks to u/EpicLix2-0 for the battle menu template png,11
this is so nice :'),8
>!You dirty sister killer.!<,9
I can't tell if this fight would be impossible or super easy,6
THIS IS SICK I LIKE IT,4
I love deltarune X omori content, good shit my man,5
If someone can find an omori sound font I’ll make in 2 seconds… if not give me a a day or two,4
Can we mention the fact both parties only exist in the dream world,5
Rude Buster is the single best thing to come out of Undertale and Deltarune imo. I’m probably the only person who thinks that lol,3
I do wonder what soundfonts were used by Pedro Silva, Bo En (Calum Boen),3
STAR PLATINUM: ZA WARUDO,4
Kris uses Flirt on Hero and the rest of Hero's party tackles them instantly.,2
This is amazing. You replicated the style so well.,2
I love it when my favorite games come together like this.  . Hard agree for renditions of Deltarune songs in Omori soundfonts and vice versa, 'cause both games have amazing soundtracks.,2
Susie reminds me of Aubrey, Ralsei reminds me of Basil's personality but Hero's tendency to help others with guides and whatnot (Basil also reminds me of Noelle), Omori's like Kris, Kel's like Lancer (and Aubrey doesn't think his jokes are funny), sproutmoles are like the checker enemies that get bigger when they wear a crown!,2
Lancer,2
I like how all of the gang are just unimpressed about Kris, Ramsey, and Susie,2
Out of curiosity do you have any other socials you post art on? This is amazing but reddit is kinda awful to follow people on haha.,1
i'm pretty sure omori uses similar soundfonts if not the exact same soundfonts as deltarune and/or undertale, i've heard the touhou soundfont, sgm, earthbound, and lots of other soundfonts used in deltarune/undertale. but there is definitely a different style to the songs here.,1

Same goes for Basil and Ralsei. And I guess OMORI and Kris? Not sure about this last one but maybe.,5

RW Aubry: strong association with the color pink. Has extremely terrible and neglectful parents. Violent and triggered easily. Are actually pretty emotional deep down. Trouble maker,1
Play it. You would probably like it. This subreddit is full of spoilers, so be careful with that.,53
Play it, it is so fucking good.,4
I can give you a run down of the game in dms if you want,2
Combined with how on Toby Fox's twitter >!Noelle's theme is titled "Lost Girl" the parallels only continue !<,20
iS tHAt A jojO REfEreNcE,3
Thanks for asking, I have [ but I don't really update it super often,1
[removed],22
But if you look at how all the characters are in their respect games could you realistically say that after the battle they both realize they're the good guys and fight together. Kel and Lancer would be best friends for sure, Kris and omori would sit in corners together, ralsei and hero would bake a cake together, and Aubrey and Susie would bond over their love of violence.,113
uhh is it a horror game? I can like easily get scared of something and immediately dislike it just for that.,20
i cant cuz it costs money and my dad got mad for buying Minecraft,1
thanks but no thanks I'd rather play it blind \^\\^,3
Thank you!,2
*. . .*,2
>they both realize they're the good guys and fight together.. . *Are they? Are they really?*,38
Isn’t RW Aubrey the violent one?,1
I'm a complete coward and I could handle it. The horror sections are short and not that bad. 95% of the game is either wholesome or sad.,37
I see, piracy is always an option but I wouldn’t recommend that.. what I will tell you is that it’s horror, most of the jump scares are optional though, the non-optional parts are like- once or twice,3
They're the protagonists of their respective games (both in dream worlds and everything) but even if they're both bad guys the point would still stand,33
does the game cost money,9
My headcannon was if the fun gang win, they convince omori's team to stop fighting (via sparing), and if omori's team wins it's like beating sweetheart/pluto,43
>even if they're both bad guys the point would still stand. . I don't think they're *both* bad guys but >!omori's even the final boss for fuck's sake.!<,6
Ehhhhhh, not really, this is in the dream world so Aubrey would be way more enthusiastic,3
yes,12
Yeah but they'd probably still keep coming into conflict.,4
welp cant play cuz my dad got angry for buying minecraft 2-3 years ago. . how come all the good games cost m o n e y,8
You can always get it by *alternative means* if you know what I mean. But if you can buy it you should absolutely do it, because indie game developers need as much support as they can get.. You can also watch a let's play, but the experience is not quite the same as playing it yourself in my opinion.,25
You can always watch someone's playthrough on Youtube- thats how I played it!,7
I know this comment is from a year ago but if you have Xbox Game Pass you can get it for free there…if you somehow managed to dodge spoilers for all this time it’s a game you’ll never forget.,2
I am watching Merg's,9
Yeah, there are lots of great playthroughs out there! I always recommend Barry's (BarryWasStreaming), but NicoB's was pretty great, and Merg is doing one currently that's been fun to watch.,2
oh well unfrotueanly i dont even have an xbox so uhhh oof. . also miraculously i have been successfully not spoiled yet to omori so if i ever do get to play it, which is very unlikely, i will sure never forget it! Such an interesting game judging from what little gameplay i have seen.,3
Hey, so am I!,3
Couldn't be more accurate,240
LOL Poster is fire though,179
Bruh I wanted the Basil shirt so bad but it sold out quicker than >!Mari falling down the stairs!<. Damn you Basil simps and damn me for being one of them.,160
I want the Hero and Omori shirts soooo bad,81
i have submitted myself to omocat-shop.com,54

I missed the Aubrey shirt, and now its sold out ;-;,26
I didn’t realize that Mari was in this picture. I have so many questions.,20
To be fair it’s cute,17
i just wish i had money. . and in a way wish there were less basil simps,11
made with memematic,8
Rightfully so.,7
can someone send me a link to the full image?,7
my mom let me buy the basil shirt amen,6
It was all an act, Mari isn't dead,6
Is this some timeline where Mari pulled an uno reverse and set her gamemode to creative?,5
omg i really want kel's shirt rn,6
It's beautiful to all eyes,5

Just copped the black sweater yesterday,3
BRO WTF I LITERALLY JUST PICKED UP MY SPONGEBOB MOVIE DVD AND DECIDED TO CHECK MY REDIT NOTIFICATION, FOR IT TO HE RELATED TO SPONGEBOB,3
Whenever i play that game i wish i had friends like that smh,2
three couples :),2
It's my computer background.,1
Facts.,66
If your not talking about the sweater and the actual shirt basil is wearing in the art, I just bought one 30mins ago so act fast if that’s the case lol,42
I agree wholeheartedly,48
Amen!,24
I genuinely believe it is 😁,3
Same brother same,5
consider it a timeline where >!Mari realized Sunny was struggling and either reassured him that she didn't mind mistakes or postponed the recital!<,30
hope the link works ,6
Wait, REALLY?! Please tell me this is 100% confirmed…,3
It’s oficial art AND it has kel in it. . Omocat created a CANON Mari lives au,5
The basil shirt is on preorder iirc so you have until tomorrow night or so to preorder! The sweatshirt is sold out tho,9
>!why does sunny have no eye then?!<,12
Nah it’s just because Sunny watched too many Ling Ling 40 hours / 2setviolin,7
thanks :D,6
Wait? **KEL IS IN IT?**. . **THE WHOLE GAME WAS JUST A FUCKING ACT?! ;-;**,5
I was gonna preorder the shirt but I decided I'm gonna save some money for the art book! I can't wait-,4
>!omocat just messing with her fans a little bit, the original image we could only really see aubrey basil sunny with a bit of kel. so everyone thought it was a "after the game" scenario!<,26
he does, it's just covered by basil. if they had the fight basil would have a scar on his nose i think,3
ur welcome:),6
Yea I hope the art book isn’t too expensive, but I know my ass is gonna buy it regardless LOL. Same thing happened with the CD for me I remember I told myself $30 was the most I’d pay for it but when I saw $40 I still just went for it.,1
true. only aspect of the game that isnt very great. omocat portrays sunny as this "cute depressed anime boy" but really he'd look fucking AWFUL after staying indoors for 4 years and not eating properly.,2039
\>Looks like shit. . \>Stabs best friends. . \>Reveals the truth. . \>Leaves. . Sigma Octadecanonuinfinitillionaire Grindset,683
His mother likely groomed his hair personally; although maybe it would've been nice to see him looking a bit rough on the second or third day.. . Maybe Sunny has a few cleanly habits that he keeps up with that are largely deceptive of his overall health and it just isn't clearly shown; still bathing and doing his own hair. We do know he doesn't eat well, as he's remarked as thin. But thin for a teenage boy and thin as in dying are different too, it's possible Sunny fits a few metrics for doing okayish, which puts his mother's guard down somewhat (still too much, but you know).. . "Yeah he looks thin and he never gets out, but he's still kind, studious (some evidence in dreams of that), cleans himself or cleans when I ask him to, and seems to say he's fine when I ask (as unwell teens also tend to, but again yeah).". . I think if anything, the picture resembles a good mental state of Sunny that is disguised by himself in the literal sense.,424
Sunny open the door...I'll brush your hair and help you get fixed up...,199
No way would he be able to take all of those hits from the hooligan fights.,450
mf looks like someone who stayed 4 years inside his house,367
Too relatable,81
I really like this depiction of Sunny, it works well with the pacing. Looking in the mirror at night to reveal a miserable, unkempt form of Omori really makes the player put on the brakes, going from the joys of Headspace, to Basil disappearing, to Omori stabbing himself, to seeing this in the mirror. All within the span of 10 minutes.. . The first day IRL is supposed to hit you hard with reality, and this would make for a great introduction.,66
omg he looks just like me fr,63
The [Person]() who made this edit!,105
*"It's been 84 years."* - Sunny seeing the sun again.,39
Perfect pic, you gain a save,29
Yeah definitely. I was thinking about that recently as I was drawing him, mans definitely wouldn't have looked so squeaky clean while being heavily depressed and dissociated, while being a hikikomori for 4 years. When I draw him pre ending etc, he looks somewhat like on this img,33
Yep, he's beginning to look like he goes on 4chan alright . . . As it should be,60
I think it would've been cool if this was Sunny's look when you start the game. And if you go through the Sunny route he would progressively look better until in the Last day he looks like in the normal portrait. However if you choose the Omori route he wouldn't change at all or would start getting worse.,25
Imagining Kel greeting him for the first time in four years with "Damn Sunny, you look like shit, lets go to Hobbeez",27
I mentally headcannon sunny does a bare minimum taking care of himself to more or less keep mom from worrying. That’s how I kinda operated even at my worst moments.,29
Emo Snuuy,22
Aubrey would go from "you look kind of thin" to "holy fucking shit i'm taking you to a hospital",24
> Goes outside. . > Stabs old best friend. . > Gets into multiple fights. . > Almost drowns . . > Fights another friend and gets stabbed in the eye. . > Tells the truth to friends and leaves. . How the fuck did this kid not at any point die???,55
tbh i like this design way better than sunny’s og design, and I already like sunny’s design.,18
All jokes aside. I did know people who were not going outside for years. One of those people, the girl, also suffered from anorexia. There was quite a difference between how those people handled themselves, despite not leaving the house. In the case of the girl, she was very uptight in regards to keeping her house organized. While she was skinny she definitely wasn’t “a ratwomen”. I am aware that some people reached level where they are severely malnourished and this hampers how they body functions. But just because it doesn’t look like it or person maintains certain level of control, it doesn’t mean they don’t suffer from the issue. . . In the case of the guy, he had trouble doing anything, including keeping contact with people for extended periods of time. . . I don’t want to go to deeply in their personal issues.  But I feel like I have to say this. People experience different  kinds of issues and this will cause them to have their ups and downs. Often without telling people what is happening and try to hide the fact that those periods did happened to them. . . So the bottom line is, don’t help spread stigmatization. On purpose or unknowingly. And don’t say “o yeah, that’s definitely how it should be in real life, that’s so unrealistic” while the reality tends to be more complicated. I understand that it sounds logical and as something that “easily should be” but then, when that’s not the case, it helps spread confusion.,19
This pic goes hard.,15
I used to look just like that in 9th grade,14
i like to think he kept up his appearance either because it’s habitual, it’s the same clothes he wore *that day,* or he’s doing it in memoriam of *them*,10
I feel like the ONLY thing Sunny did self care wise was stay ready for the recital, hence the neat, clean clothes and perfect hair, even though he knew Mari was gone,10
One more thing, facial hair.. . Though I believe what little grip on reality Sunny has may be credit to his hygiene routine being seemingly good (at least, he looks tidy). . . Having spoken to 3 therapists in my time they all think a solid routine boosts mental health. . . Or his mummy does it for him. But I'd say he'd end up looking a mess after the several days the game takes place in - with no parents to help.. . Or of course the most likely case - omocat just didn't think about this.,11
hair goes hard tbh,8
Man looks like Doug Rattman from Portal 2,8
Wow this matches the in game artstyle perfectly,9
OMG STOP THATS MY FACE DONT LEAK KY FACE ILL RPEORT U ,7
i think that's probably because it's from sunny's point of view and he thinks everything is fine until his escapism starts to break . because >!when you look in the mirror during the hiki route you see omori and not sunny!< he might not even fully process that it's been 4 entire years since what happened to mari until other people say it,8
He probably kept himself in shape during those times. He homeschooled himself, kept himself clean... No wonder he looked completely fine.,7
He just like me fr,6
yeah thats one of the only things thats kinda bugged me about omori, even though its not really that big of a deal its still completely inaccurate,5
he literally just looks like me, which makes me realize I should take better care of my looks,6
His hair would probably longer,5
I mean maybe he still brushed his hair etc. Trauma/depression/ptsd/whatever he’s going through ≠ not doing anything at all.,5
Yeah I agreed, how did Sunny stayed this clean after 4 years ?. . ...,5
Possibly long hair,9
ohhohoho man this is so accurate and a bit more realistic,5
Awesome artwork! Yeah, Sunny definitely would've looked like garbage after those four years.,4
Me waking up every morning:,4
Mood,4
looks exactly like me except the hair color,4
Wow, now Sunny and I are even more alike 0.o (Except I'm not that skinny and not malnourished),5
This looks like me if I didn’t work out,5
Really well made!. . I just wanted to point out that Sunny probably would not look tired because he sleeps A LOT. Like, he goes to bed before the sun sets snd wakes up at sunrise.,4
Nahh he wouldn't even have bothered to put on proper clothes, probably.,4
I dont get how, if he spends so much time in headspace, sleeping, why the fuck doesnt he change out of the collared shirt, literally just get some pyjamas,6
You literally made him look better,3
he looks like me during the school year,3
[removed],3
Kinda reminds me of L from death note.,3
Thats how i look everyday... :(,3
wtf he's hot now,3
Did you give him a 5 o'clock shadow? ,4
When dat something brew hits,2
Can someone make a mod so that this is what appears in the mirror from after cleaning the floor to after taking a bath (hikikomori)? Pwetty pweawse? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,2
thanks for reminding me why i kin him,2
*how I look now.,2
God I wish I could draw/edit like this, maybe one day,2
I can’t imagine him being too dirty. I mean showers are a great place to cry out your sorrows.,2
Didn't expect to be called out like this,2
needs more hair,2
4 year's no therapy,2
More like he would look like  a skeleton,2
He's still Snuuy to me, and I love him regardless of whether or not he took a shower in the last 4 years.. . Kel probably does too, he hasn't showered in a few days either,2
reminds me of me,2
His hair didn't grow btw, it feels like they got into stasis for 4 years,2
And looking like that, it seems a bit funny to me that he can do the Universally Loved achievement,2
i wish they actually made him look like that in the game. its the realism and subtle touches that matter a ton,2
League of legends player,2
This is so true, and very well done!,2
I look worse than Sunny whenever I just get out of bed, let alone shut myself in for 4 years. Immersion ruined,2
Can confirm. Been insulated in my house for years and barely go out - (school), and I do not look nice eathier. Due to being female, It's more prone on me. I can provide images but I look too shit on them to be confident to post.,2
[removed],2
\+ hair style. . \-health,2
guys can we please not forget the fact that he still lives with his mom. we don't see her since she apparently is busy setting things up for their new place, but I'm pretty sure she didn't leave Sunny to fend for himself, considering all voicemails and the sticky notes in the bathroom and Sunny's room,2
Plot twist: Sunny is so delusional that he hallucinated himself as someone clean and tidy, when in reality he looks like shit,2
Why he needs eyebags if he sleeps all the time??,2
He looks like he hasn't slept in those four years. He sleeps a LOT, so those eyebags wouldn't be there.,2
I’m just confused as to why he has literally no body hair, bro’s superpower is always having pristine skin,3
I think hed be a lot more pale,2
tbh, if there were scars i think this would be perfect, as during the times sunny was awake, he probably would commit self harm, but idk,3
I imagine that when sunny sees himself in the mirror, he’s hallucinating himself from 4 years ago on the night of the recital (which is why he seems to be dressed up every day for nothing). He just happens to look really similar to how he did when he shut himself in because he hasn’t grown at all due to malnutrition,1
i think sunny just sees himself how he did before the tragedy, being why he still looks relatively well-kept, due to him detaching from reailty,1
Wanna brush his hair and make him look like  this,1
i want to hug him and tell everythings gonna be ok,1
I’m pretty sure he does take care of himself and his hygiene not even ghost Mari will tolerate leaving him bad odor he’s literally a grown ass man! And most of you forgot he lives with his mother.,1
wow he looks like me now,1
True. .   . this is actually what I made my OC to look like, roughly,1
Actually pretty realistic,1
Hes not fat here,1
oh this is a phenomenal redraw.. . and I can confirm, this is in fact what I look like.,1
I feel like he would have grown a tiny beard,1
can i use this as a pfp on discord,1
Sunny is me fr,1
THE SAME,1
True.,1
Okay... But why is he still kinda slaying 💅. (This is a joke if you look like this please get help),1
this is accurate as someone who 1. doesn't go outside a lot and 2. didn't go outside for the many years of covid you get very messy with terrible eye bags and become very very pale,1
Hikokomori route shows that Sunny showers and changes clothes so no, he wouldn't have looked like that.,1
Omg he's literally me fr fr,1
plus his stomach would be skinny and thin because he is, well malnourished,1
Anorexia ridden rat man,976
Now that you say it...i wish this picture was actually how Sunny looked to show how bad it was for him physically even if the mum actually took care of him somewhat. We all know mentally but his physical health is important too. ~~although my guy can literally heal himself trying to stay calm so uh~~,238
He takes care of his hygiene though like his mom tells him to.. . I think seeing this in the mirror though, on the first night, would really hit the player in the gut. So this is less of a mistake and more of a missed opportunity.,160
Well, just ’cause you’re mentally ill doesn’t always mean you don’t take care of yourself physically. For some people, taking some care of your appearance can be a way to cope or to keep at least some kind of routine. It’s true that Sunny seems to have trouble eating properly and possibly remembering to brush his teeth, but in hikikomori we also see him taking a bath, so it’s hard to be quite sure how much he does take care of himself or not.,161
Maybe it’s just how Sunny sees himself since he is kinda disconnected from reality.,44
I found that a little jarring on my first playthrough. There's a shut-in at one of the Faraway houses and I wondered why Sunny wasn't as bad when they both lead the same lifstyle.,30
It would be cool if you see the groomed version of sunny when looking in the mirror but in the last day, we see this version, showing that in reality he doesn’t eat well, exercise, and isn’t groomed.,30
I just assumed he had a habit/coped by very metaciously groomimg himself etc. . He has plenty of time and still does some stuff at home. . So over time he likely developed a habit of properly dressing and grooming his hair etc,25
Actually that would've been awesome to wake up on the first day looking like utter shit and then over the next 3 days with showering and going to barber, etc. due to going outside with Kel we can look like the neat/cute sunny we saw on day one. That would've been another nice sidestory of progression that would've added to the immersion of how Sunny is trying to move on and live in reality,23
Yep, Sunny is portrayed kinda unrealistic. Also that part where Basil is having a panic attack in the bathroom he asks him "Why do you look so scared, Sunny?" The mf'er looks himself in the mirror and he's perfectly fine.,56
Yeah I think about this sometimes like this guy literally sat inside for 4 whole years and looks better than me (ik there isn’t as much detail to their faces but still),20
[removed],19
Is it confrmed that he never ate properly,15
Director's cut sunny,16
Maybe its only how hes perseving himself, like hiw he blocked the mental image of the closet, maybe hes pretending he's fine too?,15
I mean to be fair, he did still have his mom at least. . She likely kept him from completely looking like this. . But I agree that Omocat did make him look a bit overly pretty (because mangaish style),5
exactly and that's coming from a person who doesn't go outside that much,3
To be fair his Mom was there for most of those 4 years . . It's only in the last 3 days that she's out of town,1

I thought he straight up dropped out of school or something,120
I'm not a native speaker and i wasn't aware that the word grooming had a second meaning. Was very confused at first. Lmao,40

bro would have been dusted away by one gust on wind upon going outside,72
[removed],36
The RPGey things are probably him daydreaming,13
if he throws a punch he'd be the one takin damage,17
to be fair, along with that, realistically in the fights, unless kel is inhuman at making his ball bounce back to him, he would be constantly going off to pick up his basketball so he can throw it again.,3
yeah how is bro winning 4v1s looking like this,1
mf looks like someone battling with their inner demons,212

True on that.. . Not to forget that it would fit with the situation generally.,5
It's been 17 days,13
: I've forgotten what real food other than microwaved steak tastes like... WAIT WHO SAID THAT?  . . . : You said that, Sunny...  . . . : Oh... I forgot what my voice sounded like...,2
>!I mean if you replace the last step he does!<,36
Because he is the cameraman, of course/s. . (JUST BEING SARCASTIC).,12
He slashed Aubrey, not stabbed.,6
"A truth so strange it can only be lied into existence.". . "And our minds *can* lie, never doubt it...",5
FR. This started bothering me more than anything after my sister pointed it out to me: why the hell does Sunny sleep in his day clothes?? Surely he has pyjamas or like, and undershirt to sleep in right??,5
You are depressing,1
yeah, and let's not forget that he's still a kid who's living with his mom. his mom probably takes care of him, even if it's not much,2
You can get eyebags from oversleeping due to accumulated fluids under the eyes.,1
you can get eyebags from too much sleep,2
He looks pretty pale already..,8
He already is kinda skinny, however realistically he should look like just skin and bones,514
I GO UP AT NIGHT. . AND EAT YOUR ***CHEEEEEEEEEEESE***. . #AAA,109
i guess but i doubt he puts makeup on, and we don't see him fix his hair after he wakes up. Not to mention brushing his teeth is optional and he only bathes in the hikikomori route,47
He would still probably look like a twig and have messy hair..  Showering can only help so much,73
can confirm.,10
The taking a bath scene is however also the one that makes him lose his fear of drowning. Which might imply that he hadn't done it for a while. Yes I'm late to reply to this.,1
that could be true i suppose, though we do see him in the 3rd person outside of mirrors very occasionally like when they hug at the lake, or the good ending,41
Because sunny's mom knows he cant take care of himself well. She likely makes sure he eats at least every night, showers and brushes teeth. I've had short hair before and I barely even needed a comb. It wouldnt be hard to keep up an appearance. The only unrealistic thing is him >!diving and saving basil but my headcanon is mari ACTUALLY saved him just like she appeared so many other times.!< The guy in grandma's house is obviously well fed and at the very least has his siblings. Hes a shut in but hes the video game shut (who barely leaves his room) when sunny is the sleep all day shut in who barely leaves his house instead of just his room.,17
Yeah, now that's a great idea. ONE DAY LEFT on the SUNNY ROUTE would be the perfect place to have this version, as someone else suggested that the reason SUNNY looks so neat could be because of his hallucinations, and I reckon as SUNNY gets closer to THE TRUTH, he also realises he's in such a sorry state from not looking after himself.,9
i love this idea honestly,8
Maybe Basil, being such a close friend to Sunny, can read his inner emotions.,34
That's making me think... a lot of the game depends on Sunny's mental state affecting his perceptions. Something is probably the most obvious example. In my experience someone like Sunny would want to be convinced that they're totally fine. Realistically he probably would have eye bags or look somewhat differently from his appearance four years ago, but he can't see himself any differently.,21
too much sleeping can make you equally as tired though. i sleep too much and have eyebags. although eyebags aren't only caused by tiredness,17
not exactly confirmed but, >!Kels mother takes note of Sunny’s more.. slim physique. Also, on one day left in the sunny route, if you go to the park and sit on the swings with Aubrey, she also tells him he looks slimmer I believe!<,48
I would agree with this but >!we see at the end of the good ending that he looks the same in person, since this is in the third person and not in a mirror.!< Though i suppose this could still be that so you may be right.,8

Ok but what if I got my ass beat in all real world fights?,3
He did, but it's possible he could be home schooled. A lot of my assumption rests on just a few details and other themes honestly, like there was a comment on this sub where someone mentioned the French speaking sprout mole in headspace could hint that he studied French. Which could've happened before he dropped out or after, but still.. . Other details like just the sense his family gave off, strictish father, perfectionist sister, I really got the kind of energy they would take studies pretty seriously. And while it's only up to his mother now, if she not only cleans him up but tries to school him, or set him on the path to study for himself, that's kind of... Thematically consistent with what little we know of his family.. . They definitely don't give a "broken window" vibe like Aubrey and her mother, where she clearly doesn't care what Aubrey does at all, nevermind if she does well in school or anything.. . Basically I'm saying some kind of basic structure for Sunny might still exist.,176
,27
it should honestly be the other way around . . just modern social media has skewed the word the other way. . I didn't even know the bad definition for grooming until like 4 years ago,28
honestly me too lmao,9
How could it be confusing in that way for you? They were using the word's literal definition ^(@).@  . I mean, if there's one definition you'd learn from a secondhand source like a language course or a reference book or just written-word osmosis, wouldn't it be the literal one? :\\,1

now i'm just imagining someone like "DO YOU HAVE THE SOURCE TO CLAIM HE'S THE CAMERAMAN !!!??!?!?!",11
Yea but four years without going outside, only having sun from windows. I'd think he'd be a lot more pale,2
Isn't the only frame of reference the days where his mother isn't home and there's just The Steak™️? Because it *isn't* skin and bones, it's possible he ate somewhat properly during the four year time period.,373
super ghost busters is the greatest musical piece that has ever come out, thank you for recognizing that,29

Cheesa?. . ,1
Maybe it revolves around pure speculation but if we assume that Sunny's mom left a note about brushing teeth, and Sunny bathes himself in the hikikomori route, its safe to assume he has always done those.,59
He does look like a twig, and he might’ve just kept taking care of his hair. Having messy hair is kind of uncomfortable and his mom probably made sure he did the minimum of taking care of himself anyway,92
>!I assumed he attempted to save Basil but didn't think before acting and so struggled alongside Basil, both of them being saved by Hero.!<,3
It is confirmed, she says he looks pale and that he looks like he doesnt eat enough. He probably only eats dinner when his mom forces him to.,13
>!He's also in a hospital, they probably took care of him and that's why he looks neater!<,2
That song playing in my head lmao.,34
Good bot,10
,25
Although I highly doubt that his mother had the time to homeschool him because you can obviously tell she’s very busy basing it off the events of the game alone. But it’s also a possibility that Sunny could’ve been teaching himself off of a program on his computer. He does have one after all.,67
Isn't French a topic when the student reaches 6th,7th grade?. . For all i am aware of, Sunny Hikikomori'd himself near the age of 12, which isn't really the age they are taught French, for all i know.,6

Ghost Busters! They're back in town!,5
GET THE FUCKING RAT DISTINGUISHER (rat distinguisher: "yeah that's definitely a rat"),8
I don't think it's a big leap in logic at the very least. Sunny may have been a shut-in, but his mom clearly cared, so while she didn't know how to help his greater issues, she likely tried to keep him at least somewhat taken care of. Establishing a basic routine of hygiene and eating would make sense in that regard, and Sunny following it to keep his mom appeased and thus giving him more time to spend dreaming in the long run would make sense.  . . As far as his physique goes, malnourishment absolutely is part of it (and I'll note that his in-game stats do reflect this. In a fight without a knife, his punches do a quarter of Kels damage, and Kels just casually throwing a basketball at people), but I imagine what muscle he had probably also atrophied in the years in the house. He probably wasn't an athlete even as a kid, but he was active and played outside with his friends plenty, so it stands to reason he'd have some physique to lose.,61
Yeah, the notes around the house seem to imply she's aware of his situation enough not to push him, and so he maintains a basic hygiene routine but not much else. Sunny was hardly unaware of things in the real world even of his grasp on reality was shaky, so I imagine he took enough care of himself to keep his mom from freaking out too badly, especially because doing so would make it easier for him to then continue isolating himself and thus dreaming.,53
>!Pretty sure thats what happened... Thats why Kel didn't say Sunny did it, but said he was brave, Because Hero saved them both as Sunny was struggling. I tend to think canonically Sunny would have paused to silently freak out for like, 3 seconds but when he realises that its actually a danger and Kels relying on him he jumps in instead of an instant decision!<,3
Cool I just said that because my memory of that dialogue was a bit hazy,4
It's clear sunny isn't stupid. Theres been some kind of education going.,27

Tbf Aubery is a bit of a meme so it works. Just pass it off as intentional lmao. But seriously, really good job on the art!,3
Nice! Good luck on it!!,2
>!the issue is finding someone else to take care of her, if nobody steps up then since Aubrey is 16 she'd most likely fall under care of the state. Hopefully she'd be adopted by Kim or even Kel's family!<,4
I reopen Reddit and see this first. I post comment, I leave upvote and close Reddit for the day.,664
This is propably what Aubrey saw when she tried to get the journal from basil.,464
That's where the plushies went! To the one person Sunny cult!,351
To hug him right…? *to hug him… right…?*,205
i'm raiding basil's house for basil,157
Okay, Sunny's my favorite so yes. Basil, *I'd like to know your location.*,81
healthy relationships 👍,67
I need SUNNY BEAN PLUSH,57
Simp,57
Basil is a simp,51
When you're making caption memes, please credit the original artist.. . ,75
Welcome to basil space,38
POV: You are Polly,35
Oh god,33
Is that Sunny's shadow in the doorway?,20
Snuuy puulshy supremacy,17
BASIL HAS THE OMORI PLUSH. CHARGE,14
I want these plushies.. . And yes, that includes Basil, because he's adorable and has a cute squishy face. All signs point to Basil being a plushie.. . (Wow this is cringey),15
Kel: "Wow! Look at all of these! So perfect for hugging!". . Basil: "Uh, yeah... but maybe don't-". . Kel: \*giving life-sized Sunny pillow a bear hug\* "Wow it's so cuddly! Could probably use a wash tho". . Basil: \*sweating profusely\* "Hehe yeah...". . Kel: \*frowning\* "He uh, doesn't want to let go... what the hell??". . Basil looks on in abject terror as the pillow sticks to Kel,14
Basil... *tell me your location*,8
omori au where basil takes care of sunny plushies instead of plants,8
Nooo, not Bagel!!!. ... Tho if it's to hug him then okay,6
>!so this is why aubrey pushed basil into the lake!<,26
This is cannon now,5
*what the fuck*,14
That's some pretty good art,6
:flushed:,6
There was always something weird about sunny's face but I could never put my finger on it until now.. . FUMO,5
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh…,4
Well we all are gonna raid him then hug them ok,4
I want his room, how much money for it?,4
*razormind intensifies*,3
Marketable,3
We must raid Basil’s house to give him the love and support he needs,3
Nice,2
artist please,2
exuse me i would like to ask why does he have so many sunny things?,2
He has the OMORI plushies, get him.,2
I gently open the door. . wrong reference right game,1
Sharing is caring you know, Basil,1
sunflower is probably one of the most problematic legal ships,-2
This feels inappropriate,-5
ayo what the fuck basil,1
YEEES NEED ME A SUNNY PLUSHY,1
Damn same,74
I was only away for half a day, but my point still stands.,39
Literally the same thing for me,74
yup. sams,10
Yeah, probably, there's like a 500% chance it was,206
It's illegal to have that many Sunny plushies sir,162
One person?,49
POV:”You see Basil simping”,38
You see the trick is you should raid the house and take Basil too. Then you should feed and water him and soon you will have multiple basils. I do not know why you would want multiple Basils but you would have multiple Basils,116
Now that seems like a good plan for me,49
It is acceptable,38
same,17
Let's do it.,18
Take Basil.,11
Sunny bean plush is my new best friend.,14
just realized how ironic that was based on my username-,87
They explicitly mention asking for permission before using their art too...,26
Yeah, I got the image from the Discord server, couldn't find the original artist, but thanks,23
Sunny wants hugs too,8
dude. spoiler,7
Considering the good quality Omori and Sunny plushies are not for sale, if you make the Sunny plushies yourself then the total price would be of the room itself and the raw materials for plushies, though I'm clueless on the exact price.,3
. . Here, the original post,3
'Cause the artist decided to draw him that way, he actually doesn't have any of that, maybe just the photos and not that many of them, nor are they all exclusively of Sunny,3
Why ?,8
She was jealous because he has a bigger collection than her,176
Have multiple basils so that u can sell them. Then create a scarcity of Basils by hoarding them and making people think that they are rare. Don't tell people on how u create multiple Basils tho, and if they ever find out, eliminate them. . . After you profit off of Basils, try investing in Aubreys and Kels. . . 📈📈📈,65
Ah, so that's how Omori populated Black Space.,28
Ofc you need multiple basils so you can hug and comfort them all,10
Well, the more the merrier and to also >!cover up more murder!< obviously,2
sell basil's kidney for extra profit,6
Sprout Mole spotted,14
fixed, thx for noticing,3
thank you,2
Breaking and entering is illegal,3
WHY ONLY SELL BASILS?! SELL OIL AS WELL!,44
Aubreys and Kels are easier to manufacture though, simply bread them and cut the breads into four pieces, then wait for the pieces to regenerate into one Aubrey/Kel per bread piece,8
Yes that is correct however we don’t talk about what he did in black space because he did not properly feed the Basils resulting in what we see in the black space,21
**NO**,3
1. Kill BASIL. . 2. Sell his kidneys. . 3. >!Go to BLACK SPACE to find more BASILs!<. . 4. Repeat,3

True.,15

Good bot,10
I dare someone to make and drink orange joe,701
>!Out of context, the recipe for Mari’s Cookies is cute. With context, it only brings me sadness for the treehouse memory!<,398
This is so cute and explains nothing as to how to make some of the dishes lol,295
"Actually, don't attempt this. Just ask MARI to do it.". . *Sigh* Alright, >!where's the Ouija?!<,211
Im gonna try orange Joe irl just to see how horrible it tastes,152
Mari's one should have been >!pizza!<,117
Oh look a sweet jelly filled donut.,66
I CAN FINALLY MAKE THE HERO SANDWICH,50
There’s no recipe for Mari’s cookies because they’re impossible to make, even if you know how to make cookies they aren’t as good as Mari’s.,46
Orange Joe sounds kind of meh. I prefer a delicious glass of pilk,44
Omori's just eating salted rice and seaweed; and Kel's probably awake 24/7 if he drinks that on a daily basis.,35
Here’s the tweet: ,34
Orange joe omg now it makes so much sense, orange for orange juice and joe as in a cup of joe,26
so fricking cute and wholesome. happy birthday hero and happy new years,23
Not me about to turn all my oj into orange joe,19
the sandwich and grilled eggplants actually look good,15
Malewife hero is canon now,15
*So it's the same kind of book as Ralsei's manual*,14
Sunny's would be microwaved steak,14
That apron is cute,12
Don't lie . You know he looks cute in the apron...,21
If I had any orange juice, I’d be doing unspeakable things to it right now,10
The flavour text on kel's orange joe is perfection,10
Proof that Sunny is Japanese descent. . And possible proof of Kel having autism,29
Neat,8
This is awesome!!! I’ve always wanted to try something that was made in Omori! Just not… the orange joe…,8
Hero is the best cooker,7
Finally, Orange Joe recipe,7
Wait......did Omocat reference the theory that Aubrey's last name is aubergine?,7
OMORI'S ONIGIRI? I'm confused, all I see are jelly-filled donuts.,6
THIS IS AMAZING!!!! Thanks for sharing this!,5
THIS IS SO CUTE,5
Thanks I will proceed to eat only this for the rest of my life,4
I expected Orange Joe to be sweeter, tbh.,4
Now I can eat depression!,6
How am I supposed to ask Mari to make them?!?!,4
Basil is vegan or it's just a normal salad,7
I feel like the sandwiches are covered in jam-,4
Don't lie . You know he looks cute in the apron...,5
I’ll drink Kel’s orange joe,3
Hero: I made a recipes for Mari’s cookies!. . Basil: Wow, it tastes exactly the same!. . Hero: Thanks! The recipe is-. . Hero:*gets sniped from a distance*. . Mari: B U L L S E Y E,3
I feel Omori would sometimes just slap on either slightly wet, or completely uncooked rice to make his Onogiri...,3
Guys i don't think we can make mari cookies any more,2
I feel like Kels OJ would actually be ok if the coffee was replaced with like Red Bull or something,2
I don't care if I'm called sus, I WOULD let Hero clap these cheeks.,2
Mr. Plantegg noooooooo,2
OH NO,2
If it tastes bad it’s normal✨💅,1
My hero,1
>!well you wont ask mari now!<,1
I don't think I have the right ingredients for the Mari cookies,1
I'm making the cookies with my mom right now too!,1
Missed the chance to make it a gyro,1

You better not put american cheese in a salad tf,1
Additional recipe: Spooky Something Cookies (). . * Make cookies with cocoa powder for a dark tint.. * Add an oval of white sugar cookie icing on each cookie for the eye white.. * Add a chocolate chip on each oval for the pupil.. . Enjoy your Something-themed cookies!,1
I will do it on Monday. Ill post the proof here aswell.,282
I hate you. I CAN STILL FUCKING TASTE IT!,190
Ya'll if you guys fr end up dyin' or smthn because I dared you to drink orange joe, I ain't gonna take any of the blame, it's all on you now.,75
I genuinely want to taste it but I'm tired and it's night so eh ;-;,26
I did it, and it doesnt taste bad! It is kind of good tbh,18
i heard that its better to try apple joe first.,17
/j,31
ill do it once i can get some orang juice,8
It’s quite popular in Russia, it’s called a “bumblebee”,5
 There’s this,3
YOUR PFP I LOVE IT,3
Hey, it's actually pretty good tho,3
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),169
I can feel its just a burning memory and it's scaring me.,10
... That's about what we should've expected from a 12 year old, come to think of it.,165
Well I mean, it is in Sunny's head and he probably has no idea how to cook real dishes.,78
Actualy the sandwhich is pretty easy, if you know how to make sandwiches you can make one. . Same for Basil's Garden Salad, if you know how to make a salad, gathering up the ingredients and mixing them into a salad shouldn't be difficult either,34
What do you mean just eyeball them,1

She drew an image of Aubrey captioned Aubregine on twitter, I think it's just her full first name,2
Ouija Board,3
He is shown to eat chicken when you have lunch with Polly, I doubt she would have done that if Basil was vegan/vegetarian. I think Hero choose salad because Basil likes plants and it is a plant based food.,26
Your sacrifice will be forever remembered in the archives,64
AHAHHAHAHA how'd it taste mate? XDD,97
THANK YOU FOR THE SACRIFICE I WOULD DO IT BUT NY TOUNGE IS SUPER BURNT RN,18

I dont care about cat girlfriends, I just want to be loved :'(,4
Never really been a fan of gators or cats so I'll take none,3
Both,3
Yes,3
Mari is both already taken, and a female. I like guys. So therefore, the best option is those Gator Boys.,3
if i had a cat girlfreind i wouldnt be able to go outside with her because it would embarass me. If i had some ultra chad bodyguards who were loyal to me. It would be amazing. Im not your average discord user,3
Please I just want my sister back,3
Gator guy ofcourse. Mari's already taken and I'm gay.,3
…i like boys, and i’m lazy. 100% Gator Guys,5
Gator guys will get me Mari so I’ll have both,3
Gator guy boyfriend,2
As a straight female, gator guys.,2
Gatorade too good to pass up,2
A cat girlfriend as long as she is a sadistic robot like me,2
Gayter guys,2
I'll take Mari and give her to Hero,2
I had a comment, but I'm on mobile and don't know how to mark spoilers, please just trust me it was good,2
Yes.,2
The bros since she could just dump you anytime ✊,2
everyone be like "i'll take gator guys because mari is taken/>!dead!<" but i will gladly take the gators over mari because theyre just clearly superior,2
i mean the gator guys obviously, since they're 100% loyal, i'll just ask them to build a genetically engineered cat gf, doneso,2
Where was the first picture from? Curious. . Also I pick Option 2 because im not into necrophilia,2
Gator guys for sure. . Girls are temporary, the Boys are forever,2
I have a boyfriend already and I'm gay, thus I'm definitely chosing Gator guys.,2
Cat girlfriend is also dead,2
r/furryirl,2
gator guy,2
Mari already taken so am I GATOR GUYS make me a pillow fort so I can cuddle with my gf,2
This is a though one,2
Gator guys are 100% loyal and the cat girlfriend  loves you but it doesn't mean she is loyal,2
Mari, but as a friend. I won't take her from Hero, I'm not *evil*.,2
WHY IS EVERYONE TRYING TO FUCK THE GATORS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,2
(presses cat girlfriend),2
Cat gf. The army of gator guys is too good for me.,2

well Mari's taken so I'll just take the gator guys,2
gator guys since their loyal they can get me a cat girlfriend,2
men,2
Gator guys, ofc, Mari has Hero 😌,2
Gator Guys then make one of them my girlfriend,2
Gator Guys because if they’re 100% loyal, then they can easily get me the cat girlfriend.,2
That cat girlfriend looks an awful lot like Mari.. . As great as Mari is, I have to go with the gator guys.  Mari isn't my type.,2
i didn't know Cat Mari was canon. i thought this was only a fanart thing.. . Nice.,2
The gator guys have a cooler soundtrack,2
Gator guys,2
Gator guys,2
Bro’s before hoes,2
The cat still has lifes then...,2
cat girlfriend,2
Gator Guys, easy.,2
since mari is taken, I go with gator guys and since they are loyal I ask them to find me a catgirl,2
Gators. Definitely Gators. Or else I'd have to deal with a catgirl that loves me, though I cannot love her back.,2
Mari is a child, Gator guys 100%,2
Gator guys, they can get me a yandere cat GF,2
Gator guys won't piss on my carpet.,2

Hmmm.... . Hard to decide which I would choose so.... . Sorry Catgirl Mari, but I'm choosing Gator Guys!,2

Gator guys,2
Only one of these gives you an infinite supply of rubber bands. The choice is obvious.,2
most definatly GATOR GUYS i dont want a girlfriend,2

Giga Monty!,4
Gator guys obviously . What dumb question is this,2
Okay usually I go for the cat girlfriend in these questions just because the alternative is some dumb materialistic thing, but I’m gonna have to go with the gator guys, they’ll probably be more supportive than a girlfriend could ever be,4
Why would I want >!corpse!<?,3

put the text you want to spoiler tag between >! and the same symbols in reverse (Can't write it or it will spoiler tag).

Basil is going to San Francisco,3
I can literally hear him saying "Everything is going to be okay" over and over again,3
Sunny speed up the car,5
basil is mr. death grips?!,4
 now that i have seen post I can just imagine sunny saying “get in loser we’re going to brazil” and I am haunted by that sentence…,3
Ok this was unexpected,3
He would brobably crash into something,3
Basil is MC Ride,2
Ah yes... ***Brazil***. . ***Aka as Black Space 3*** (Yes.. I'm hu3zilian, posso proceder com a info),2
omori eurobeat ending,2
Kel is in speedy mcqeer,2
If you put a R between B and A in Basil, you will get the word Brasil, that means Brazil in Portuguese,2
U ARE GOING TO BRAZIL,1
Why did Sunny wanted to go to Brazil anyway?,1
. . Every basil meme is canon,1
Brazilian lighting mcqueen,1
Sunny isn’t actually going to Brazil, he just wants the Piston Cup.,1
DEJA VU! I’ve just been in this place before,1
In Brazil they spell it Brasil - Bra Sil…,1
If he come here to brazil ill beat him up,1
No I shall'nt.,73

Ok . .*puts basil on a bus*.,8
Actually, in portuguese it's called Brasil too!  . At least in brazillian portuguese, but I guess all other countries' portuguese also spell it with a "S" as well,38
Wait a sec,. . Take out the R in Brasil. . What does it spell?,43
are you like talking about the country Brazil? or the name of basil in your language?,13
YUH,10

Oh really?,8
I think they're talking about the country (in Portuguese we say Brasil too),16

Se der tempo me bota do lado de um pão com mortadela,2
Actually, countries do have translations (or even different names) depending on the language. I mean, Germany in english is Germany, but in german it's Deutschland, in portuguese it's Alemanha and so on...,12
All country names are translated in chinese.,3
every kel meme is canon,3
Ta pronto lá,2
That, yes. Like my name, matias, in english would be matthew. But my name isnt matthew.,2
Ok... but thats not the point...,1
That's true,1
I don't get the point then,1
This gives me the will to live,2
We are talking about basil in spanish. Not random names in chinese. It is cool to know though,2

This doesn't look pixelated at all. It looks like a Neo-Geo graphic which looks far better than a pixelated art. Despite that, I love this especially the colors and the background.,3

~~I guess Dream Mari is now Hero’s Dream counterpart~~. . >!Don’t worry Basil, that isn’t blood, it’s just watermelon juice!<,987
Meanwhile omori and sunny: *having a legendary battle while dark souls boss battle theme is playing*,878
This is canon, right?,582
Sunny: "Hey...". . Omori: "Shut up",422
Sunny n Omori in the background T-posing at each other because they don't want to fight infront of their friends but they need to show their dominance anyway,628
Sunny to Aubrey: “Uh…I was 12 when I made them, you can’t blame me for any strange or inaccurate things about them! Heheh…”,311
Dream Mari: hey where is my counterpart?,444
Sunny is going to explain a lot to Aubrey :D But looking at her she seems kinda happy about it ;D,249
I was thinking about this in a daydream a while ago.  . . . Thanks and good job for making it a reality!,115
Don’t worry dream basil is just sleeping,107
Fanfic pls. . Friends within and without ended so I need more of this,74
Meanwhile Sunny and Omori are either giving each other the stink eye to ensure that the other doesn't say or do anything that might ruin everything. . . OR . . Sunny is desperately holding Omori back mentally from killing real world Basil while coming up with explanations for Basil and Aubery. also Dream mari if she asks something she shouldn't that'll make Omori try and kill them all  harder.,68
Meanwhile. Omori:. . Sunny: . . Omori: *dramatically points dull knife at Sunny*. . Sunny: *dramatically pulls out violin*,69
Kel: My own clone!. . Dream!Kel: Now neither of us will be balling alone!. . Aubrey: ...Why i did think about...? Oh God, i am sick.. . Dream!Aubrey: Think about what?. . Hero: Don't ask.. . Dream!:Aubrey: >:(,128
that "Hahaha" kinda sends lmaoo,60
Hero getting cucked by his dreamself, feelsbadman,98
SO CUTE AHYDVJYY7HF,35
Aubrey would actually say "huh, fair enough" in my opinion,31
dont worry basil, thats just a watermelon that somehow looks a lot like you, and you know what we do to watermelons,35
Sunny and Omori: >!Intense violin noises!<,31
Alternative response from my previous comment:. . **Sunny hands Aubrey a knife**. . Sunny: “All I ask is that you make it quick.”,25
what I have to say about this situation is:. . \-Basil will have more trauma to see his dead headspace self and know that he has done it several times.. . \-Kel found the ultimate companion to play.....and is another Kel XD. . \-Hero will be happy (and sad) to see Mari back but he will be jealous of his Headspace self for having her, and well Headspace's Mari is going to have a certain existential crisis when she sees that her real world self is dead...and Headspace Hero is perplexed to see his real world self.. . \-Oh Aubrey It seems that you are discovering the secret of a certain cat boy XD, and Aubrey from headspace as always adorable but I think she won't be too happy to find out more about her real life self.. . \-Meanwhile off-screen, Sunny and Omori are having a tense moment watching all of this: Two Kel who would amount to twice as much mischief, Basil watching something he shouldn't, two Hero's who are sure to fight to stay with Mari (or on her own she takes both), and a very embarrassed Aubrey after discovering a little secret while the other is fantasizing, and in turn they have another fight with violin music in the background (some things never change for Sunny and Omori) XD,28
Ok this is adorable,20
I would have thought Kel would fight over the last bottle of Orange Joe or some scenario along those lines...maybe I'm just conflict keen.,21
Dream Mari: >!Oh... a gravestone.!<,21
y'all saying that sunny and omori would be fighting to death . . i say:. . sunny: hello. . omori: hello. . sunny: sorry for beating you down. . omori: its ok, thanks to that im retired,20
THE BASIL PART IS JUST. OH MY GOD,16
i headcanon that dream basil and real basil are one and the same since basil was involved in the... thing so both sunny and basil are in the same dream.,14
Shit went from zero to a hundred real quick,12
pain,9
Omori DLC,6
Kel would definitely do finger guns with his dream self,6
Meanwhile Sunny and Omori are committing war crimes with hector.,5
omori with a dead stare at rw basil,3
i love it,1
Omori isn't there due to dissapearing in red space.,1
*slight inhale*. . AAAAAAaAaAaAaAaAAhh!!,216
*VORDT THEME STARTS*,190
How about the Pure Vessel theme. . (Btw I've been considering playing dark souls after playing Hollow Knight, which game should I play first, and does it have scary/disturbing things that are worse than omori?),33
***Plin Plin Plon***,19
kel in the meme, certified,681

As long Kel is there,46
Omori: *Ominous silence*,249
Canon,225
I imagine they’re just beating the shit out of each other and nobody bats an eye to it,178
Aubrey: “The Kel you dreamed up is the EXACT SAME as the real one, though!”. . Sunny: “Uh... erm... well...”. . Omori: ***watching the argument while drinking black coffee***,219
last words before sunny dies from a bash to the skull,27
“she’s downstairs, Mari.”,484
BRUH,92
she went to get the pizza that they ordered,35
I think he has more to explain to Basil...,254
He ate too much watermelon,60
I would also like a fanfic,18
something: **panicked because doesnt know wich of them to choose**,19
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,36
Sunny: "Nah it's cool, why do u think I brought them here?",23
"I like ya cut g",14
Dream Kel likes milk, so that wouldn't happen,8
Oh that's a different mari, the other mari is . d o w n s t a i r s,8
he was involved in the pizza delivery,10
>!That whole part was all shits and giggles until basil exploded!<,199
**Please no.**  .  I'm sorry but as a dark souls Fan the Vordt Theme is SO overused.  .  I get that it's Intense at the second phase but still. Why cant we have the [Soul of cinder]() theme or [Slave Knight Gael]() theme Or hell.. Anything else   . anything asides from [THIS]() (Bass boost warning.),59
Hollow knight have a pretty sad lore and idk about dark souls,15
hollow knight has a lot of abyss baby murder, not disturbing or graphic tho, just kinda oh mah gah moments. And that's coming from someone who doesn't have the balls to even play OMORI, just watch it and suck up the lore like the goblin i am.,10
Thank you based Kel,211

Sunny: ₒₖ,182
Half life npc conversations in a nutshell,9
>!And now both of them lose an eye!!<,105
goddamn anime dragon ball s jojo fight goin on. . and nobody cares,39
Sunny: well…what about Omori? He’s the me of this world, and we don’t act like each other at all! Also Kel is more simple to get down, I mean he hasn’t changed in the last four years. And don’t forget how different emotions work in the dream world, a single dandelion is all it takes to get dream you from ecstatic, depressed or enraged to completely neutral! Does that really sound like anyone from our world?,103
The fragance of black coffee,12
Not sure how she’s gonna manage to do that to what is essentially the god of that world.,9
Well... In this situation the explanation will be more ducked up. But it would essentialy boiled down to "I needed to kill your dream you to save your real You". Which is creepy but true,177

Sunny: See!? ***turns to Omori*** also there’s no need to be rude...,60
Ownership or not, it’s still in Sunny’s mind.,9
Coz' he would not remember the truth if he didn't kill him in a dream and if he hadn't remembered the truth he wouldn't have aweken that night to save Basil from commiting Suicide,15
omori: ***stare*** (shut up you know you would be dead without me),42
yeah you are right, but the image of a stressed out sunny seeing a nailed bat going to his head is hilarious nonetheless,12
Sunny: ***stares back*** (You tried to kill me. And you wouldn’t even exist without me.),44
He’d probably breakdown crying and repeatedly say sorry even though he’d be in no danger if he saw her about to hit him with a nailed bat, which would probably not sit well with his Dream friends,10
omori:(well you wouldnt have created me if you werent a crybaby who didnt know how to deal with some hair with a eye),34
that or he calms down and will just casually pull off the kitchen knife,10
I wonder how it feels to become toast.,6
Sunny: (No, I wouldn’t have created your body if not for that, you as a person wouldn’t exist if I had literally any other outlet I was brave enough to take. You’re literally the embodiment of all my angst.),27
omori:(uuhhh, f you, **resets dream world)**,28
Sunny: (Who’s the crybaby now?),16

Yay you look so good as Mari  !,413
Very good job on the cosplay, you look spot on like her! And the wheelchair actually adds a cool detail to this cosplay considering Mari’s bad knee, I could see her using one to help ease it,351
if anyone doesnt like the wheelchair take it as an alternate universe where mari survived,824
,234
At first I thought you were making fun of Mari’s fall, which I thought was hilarious in a diabolical way, then I realized that you just have a wheelchair and then I felt bad, and then I realized that it makes your cosplay even better,211
Why is everyone assuming the wheelchair is part of cosplay instead of the far more natural assumption of them needing one?,43
1. Your cosplay looks great!. . 2. Inb4 someone comes and makes a certain ableist joke that involves some spoilers (I already have a pretty good idea of what the joke is, unfortunately).,95
mari took a selfie yall! HI MARI!,23
Beautifully done. ,34
An Omori themed picnic sounds so fun! You make a great Mari! ☺️,26
You look beautiful as Mari! :3,11
 It’s like you’re literally Mari if she >!survived the fall! !< Awesome cosplay, OP! It works on, like, double levels!,10

It looks great! I also appreciate the fact that you have the picnic basket as a prop.,3
Dont let anyone insult you over your weight or disabilities. Just ignore them. Good work, good cosplay. Have fun!,3
That looks great! You even got the loose strand of hair that comes down. Is the wheelchair a disability aid or part of the cosplay? Hope you don't mind me asking :),3
The responses were not what I was expecting,3
It's excellent,3
I love itttt,3
UR SO BEAUTIFULL!!!!!!!,3
[removed],3
OMG YOUR COSPLAY IS SO AMAZING I LOVE IT!! BIBLICALLY ACCURATE MARI. . Edit: grammar/spelling,3
AMAZING COSPLAY!!! It brought me back to "Here comes the sun", a fanfiction AU where Mari is paralized from the waist down and Sunny is nonverbal,3
This cosplay rocks 🪨!,6
cool,5
The picnic basket is adorable omg (love the cosplay btw <33),5
The good ending where she just gets crippled instead. Wonderful cosplay,5
Such a good cosplay \~ The wheelchair seems canon enough to me too\~,8
You're so pretty and so is the cosplay!! And the wheelchair fits mari aswell like pookie is mari irl atp 😭😭AWESOME COSPLAY THO GJ!! ,2
 Cosplay is so good, and the wheelchair makes it even better,2
The good ending,2

Why.... Why would people have a problem with that? No offense but she isn't on that wheelchair because she wants,249
Or maybe just "fuck them"?. . /shrug,61
That's what I also thought!,91
If anyone doesn't like the wheelchair they can go fuck themselves,36
The slightly better ending,53
That was immediately what I came up with. Mari survives falling down the stairs but loses most or all leg function,18
\[Everyone liked that\],5
[deleted],3
An artist on instagram made that AU, I think, it already exists!,1
It's kinda fucked up that that's the first thing my mind went to. "This is the alternative universe where Mari got crippled rather than killed by Sunny",1
This or she uses it as support because of her bad knee,0
LMAO WHAT IS THIS?!,44
we met again my sillyass omori art,9
I thought it was the middle finger💀,1
Exactly it’s a need for me,32
Honestly I’m not even sure myself, maybe a bit of both lol,4
There was a Sunny there but no recital this time,2
It’s fine. It’s a disability aid since I’m paralysed and can’t move otherwise,1
Mhm,1
It’s a wig, my real hair is brown,1
No YOU are so perfect 💖,1
No I didn’t, I’m in the uk lol,1
Ngl man pretty damn weird to use a real wheelchair user as your AU fanfic shit.,1
say em no balls,3
[removed],-2
I’m literally paralysed I need the wheelchair to move it’s not a prop,16
Have you considered that some irl people need wheelchairs too?. . Like, for example, the one making this post?,43
It makes me sad people have an issue with that. We should respect each other  .,165
Some people are just stupid ,92
ngl i thought that was just part of the cosplay. omori best ending: nobody dies,59
Same,5
I mean the weak knee is canon so,18
Yeah I think this is the best cosplay you can do if you have a wheelchair because you can save Mari!!!!,1
I mean it isn't like it's invisible, at some point it will be mentioned, and to expect everyone to pretend it doesn't exist is just stupid. If there is going to be any comment made, at least they were attempting to be supportive... Some people like to take offense at things in place of others and blow things up into bigger deals than they really need to be, which is gross, and a real problem these days. You were the one who brought negativity into the conversation, regardless of the fact that it was coming from good intentions, try to do better.,1

*Microwaved steak,34
the goddamn difference for the word ***steak*** is halirioujssoksinjrusiwkskkskakakaaAaAAAAAAAAAA,37
Sunny: “…life is tough, okay?”. . Aubrey: “Okay, but at least get something else to eat while you’re depressed, why not pizza?”. . Sunny: ***immediately whips out his phone and begins ordering Pizza Hut***,16
Aubrey eyeliner game on point tho,16
I guess you could say that the *steaks* are high,8
I love it, the art style reminds me of that comics of Toad asking Mario his fears and piano,8
Parasoul Aubrey is making me feel... things, that's for sure,10
Smol omori,3
Hey i'm a bit late but can I translate this comic? Will credit you of course, I don't see many OMORI fans where I live (Brazil) and I think this one is funny even without context.,2

Omori really feels like a fusion between Yume Nikki and Off's protagonists,323
[removed],66
Also does Brad Armstrong fits into this similar kind of RPG genre?,50
Yume Nikki isn’t really a rpg but I’ll let it slide cause it’s cool af. . Edit: this is a joke, of course she fits in,62
I love this omg <3,7
Someone should really make a RPG where they all meet,7
This is AWESOME, I'm a sucker for character lineups,, and this deffo hit the spot!! Awesome work!!! :DD,7
im gonna offend a lot of people by saying this but i've been playing smash a lot and i only know ness as mr. PK Fire,5
I love this! I constantly wanna see more art with these protags together- it's cool tracking earthbound's influence across all of them and seeing how each one plays off the themes 😭💖 the art is super cute, too, your style is so crisp and clean!,3
This is exactly the kind of art I have been looking for, if I had a Reddit award I would give it to you. Thank you.,4
Awesome work,3
Very nice! Thank you for sharing!,3
You should do Wayne from Hylics,2
nice drawing on some of my favorite RPG characters :D,2
cool drawing!,2
Tried to say out loud, "Incorrect, Omori should have a knife," but I ended up saying, "Incorrect, Omori should have a gun.",1
2 of these fight eldritch horror and the remaining 2 jump off,1
Nice piece! Needs more knives though. :(,1
only a month late but man this looks so good,1
next,,, the batter /j,1
You drew this?? That's amazing!,1
Sunny vs Frisk knife fight,1
Ubertale,1
Realized all has at least a bit of horror, undertale with omega flowey and the chara jumpscare, earthbound with the giygas (I think I spelled it wrong) fight,1
Nice art style,1
I think it’s clear that if your rpg has a mc that wears pretty plain clothes than you are on a right track for success.,1
This is amazing,1
Wait you drew that? (That's my desktop background),1
Can you guess which two have sever mental issues?,1
honestly the whole game felt like a mashup of undertale, yume nikki and off (last two especially for the black space),130
I didn't really felt that OMORI was influenced by OFF. It's much more influenced by Earthbound, Yume Nikki and Undertale. I mean, OFF's world is way too logical for Yume nikki but too surreal for undertale or earthbound, so it didn't quite fit with the narrative of omori. . . I was really hoping to see an OFF reference, maybe give Aubrey a weapon called the Bat or something :(,29
Ummmm akshually Frisk is canonically non binary!. . Yes I had to reply to a 1 year old comment for this,20
He kinda do but he's an adult . So, he might not fit into these artwork since it's mostly feature young characters. . I just recently found out the game and I might try to make another extended version of this containing more rpg characters if o coulf find more,15
The game was made using a RPG maker so.. yeah xD,64
It's not a JRPG but *Yume Nikki* was the progenitor of an entire genre of ambient exploration games made in RPGMaker, I think she fits here just fine, especially since *Yume Nikki* looms large over *OMORI* in general.,9
Not exactly an RPG, but her stats tell a story.. . Madotsuki has some starting experience, but only a single hitpoint. When she levels up by collecting effects, she gains no stats and her EXP values stay at 9/14. If she gains max HP at a vending machine, these imaginary hitpoints serve her no real purpose. And the Yen on her character sheet is just a dream.,10
*Yume Nikki* is certainly an influence but--and I don't mean to be rude--I think you may only think it's particularly similar to *Undertale* and *OFF* because all of these games also draw a lot from *EarthBound*. I'm sure there's at least some cross-talk there, but *OMORI* doesn't really strike me as much like either *Undertale* or *OFF*. Very different thematically from either.,65
OMORI is more like a combination between Yume Nikki and Silent Hill, with slight inspiration from The Matrix (Headspace looking like The Construct and Mewo's importance being similar to the black cat glitch),4
Real Aubrey always has a bat, Dream Aubrey is shown using a bat to smash breakables and can get one as a weapon if you >!defeat Abbi and find the tentacle that gives Omori a bat!<.,14
It is the gender of the player. So I guess it could also be NB IDK.. . Tobias Zorro gave us a prota mirror.,3
I thought they were agender,1
I’ll allow it,7
Guys I’m joking around. . Omori pretty much turns into a Yume Nikki fan game by the end,11
I agree, my post was just a dumb joke,2
I'm talking about the characters not the game itself.,23
Omori gave me some feelings which felt pretty similiar how Undertale had made me feel, but I still think this is mainly because both games draw so much inspiration from EarthBound. It's great though, I love all of these games!,16
Yeah, I’m not really seeing the connection between Undertale and OFF either,3
After Undertale and Omori, I'm seriously considering Earthbound. Is it that scary? One look at  the Gygas bossfight was enough to send me running but after Omori I may have the courage to try again. Are there any themes/scenes that are scarier than Omori?,1
There are baseball bats in *EarthBound* too. I think that's kind of a surface-level similarity, honestly.,8
[deleted],1
Well yes, but I was responding to the other person who replied to you.,15
hey, i know this is 2 months late, but it's not that scary imo! there's one scene other than the final boss that's pretty scary, but it's more tame than what was in omori. . . the majority of the game is more funny/quirky. i highly recommend it, especially if you liked undertale and omori!,4
why?,1
Is this your art? If so really cool!,173
Into the dungeon you go!,92
woah your art style is amazing,39
[This is my original twitter post!](),22
Truly deserving of a beating.,18
Love her appearance but don't like her heart. Great art btw,13
THE COLORING,9
Your art is wonderful. Great job!,11
This art is so amazing,10
Now do PerfectHeart and her passive aggressive smile,8
POV: You are being mocked by an obnoxious-looking person. . Incredible art by the way! You really nailed her facial expression,8
What a cute jelly filled donuts,6
wow your artstyle kinda gives me danganronpa vibes, loving it!,4
Thought this was official art at first. Awesome job,3
Finally, some good Sweetheart art!,3
Holy shit this is so good,3
I read  it in frieza's voice. . I'm ashamed,2
Wow, this is impressive.. . Keep up the great work!,2
The eyes and hands are so well drawn, It makes me want to get back to drawing just to get to that level of skill, it's so good,2
This is amazing !!! Omg,2
This donut is great!. . Jelly-filled are my favorite. . (awesome art OP),2
That’s really good!,2
Why she looking like she's gonna order 289 medium DrPeppers at McDonald's and intends on spilling them all on the floor to piss off the employees,2
This is cool!,2
i love your art but i still wanna stab her to death,2
Amazing! As a beginner artist i understand you spent a lot of time on this,2
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO. . (also very nice drawing!),2
Thank you! official arts are amazing, so I drew this hoping to get as close as I could!,1
I'm in love with this drawing, your style is amazing!!,1
Damn I really like the way u draw the hair, cool art.,1
MERRY CHRISTMAS . . . . I’m sorry,1
Damn nice job,1
God the annoying this art emits is too perfect,1
Her theme is a banger and you can’t tell me otherwise- I have paused on dialogue for at least close to ten minutes just VIBING to it,1
Hey Kel drink this coffee for me,1
,1
yes! I drew it!. Thank you so much!XD,120
Nooo!! I found the exit!!! LOL,32

Ohhhhhhhhh....,2
Thank you!!. I love her look too! "Her look!" LOL,10
YEAH! Thank you!!! We met again! LOL,11
Thank you very much!!!,5
sounds good!,2
I had this look on my face the whole time I was drawing this picture LOL. I'm so glad I stuck with the expression! Thank you very much!,2
The statue's moving!. I'm sure she was told by Spaceboy(sic) to...,2
Is that so! I've never been told that before!. But I'm glad because I like the design of Danganronpa!,3
WOW!! I'm so honored to hear you say that! Thank you!. I really love official art!,2
Thank you so much!! I'm glad to hear that!,1
Thank you! she and I be manic!,1
LOL  Frieza's voice is "Hohhohho",3
Thank you! I hope to draw lots more OMORI fanart!,1
I'm so honored! Thank you!. I love drawing the eyes, and it took me forever to draw the hands, so I'm glad you complimented me on both!,2
Thanks a lot!!XD,1
Thanks for calling it good art!. She's full of pride, though...,2
Thanks!!,1
Thank you!!!,2
Thanks for the compliment on my drawing!. When she became MANIC, I was DEPRESSED.,1
OHOHOHOHOHO!!!. (Thank you very much!),1
I feel like she have so much chaotic energy with your art style those.. . “~~She like about to Zaduro the gang~~”,29
GUARDS! get this insolent brat! /j,5
Yeah! I loved watching you play Omori! It looks like a lot of people love your art too! Your art skills are powerful enough to achieve world domination.,3
I thought the same.. . At first I thought you just drew her with Danganronpa's artstyle.,2
Or ohohohohoho depends on u hear it. . Either way it's both. . Btw good art,3
good bot,1
You are welcome.,1
Huh ok,1
She gave me a hard time.... She'll take you to the dungeon... (whisper),15
Thank you so much for watching stream all time, even though my English is terrible!. Okay, I'll practice drawing more and achieve my dream of world domination and world peace. hehe,1
oh sorryXD. Thank you!!,2
Your English is better than my Japanese! I look forward to seeing more of your drawings in the future!,2

Censor everything, im pretty sure everyone can get what you mean just by the uncensured part,174
>!also neutral ending: oh wait I stabbed myself FOR REAL TOO?! Darn it i totally didnt want this... oh well i guess im here now!<,30
i wouldnt consider stabbing yourself "dying in your sleep",9
This should be on a poster,40
That fookn scarred me that was so fucked up,55
Idk either lol, it's just a random screenshot that I saved on my phone.,42
Done.,60
Censor this,6
This entire post is spoiler tagged and this is a discussion sub . . If you are on here without knowing the endings thats just your own fault,19
this game is so fucked man,974

welcome to picnic space you have been snaccing here for as long as you can remember,432
It's kinda unsettling that Sunny's "safe space" where he can escape from reality is a reflection of how he remembers Mari... unsettling and sad at the same time.,432
never payed attention to that , daaaaamn,127
Holy shit I never noticed,140
Mewo doesn't exist,96
YOOOOOOOO,47
Bro...didn't thought of it,wow,39
Neat observation. White Space is a mental safe space for Sunny so it makes sense he'd make it somehow resemble something that made him calm/happy, even if it's subconscious,38
Well, more material for Omari au.,53
Alternate au . . Mari is in a coma and Sunny is burdened by a mountain of guilt and the dream world is created but Mari is in it too!!.,23
omari,19
Welcome to the Picnic.. . . . . You've been having picnics with your friends as far as you remembered.,20
What a fucking game,17
Holy shit.... What does this mean,13
“Would you like to have a picnic with MARI (aka best girl)”. . 👉🏻yes. . no. . 🥲 it’s getting kinda hot in her my eyes started sweating,18
My whole life is a lie... how can i be the same after that?!,9
Meow? (Waiting for something to happen?),8
:'( damn, when Sunny manifested that space to protect him, he couldn't help but mirror Mari's picnic blanket because she made him feel so safe,6
I didn't noticed there was a second image, so i was just trying to undersrand what was missing frim mari picnic,6
Jeez this is sadly poetic...,4
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT THIS MEANS I AM SO CONFUSED AND DUMB IVE BEEN STARING AT THIS FOR 2 MINUTES HELP,7

He’s outside the white space blanket so he couldn’t be carried over,88
YOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD SHIT GOOD SHIT RIGHT THERE,9
YEAHHHHHHHHH,5
it means that the white space blanket resembles the picnic sheet and understand the rest ur self its pretty obvious just sum kind of easter egg ig,14

it surpassed undertale?. #IT SURPASSED UNDERTALE?!,364
Omori being more popular than Undertale seems insane considering how (relatively) chill the fandom is. . Either that or my standards have changed since the days of Undertale,256
We did it boys! Mental stability is no more,128
seeing omori above undertale made me happy and sad at the same time... i love omori and undertale equally, and i think they're good in different ways.,93
terraria:,35
From what I've seen, Omori has beaten Undertale on every list they share, actually.,75
Hades is an rpg? Huh… i guess.,68
Is it because I'm tired, or did it surpass Undertale.  . . . Fucking Undertale,21
Holy shit, really?,10
I'm both proud for south park the stick of truth and omori because they are the best RPGs imo,7
YOOO OMORI BEAT UNDERTALE,8
Kel pulled a Kel Nuke on Sans (geeeeeet dunked on!).  . Basil used weed killer on Flowey.  . Aubrey bashed Mettaton to pieces.  . Hero made Undyne into sushi.  . Omori did not succumb to Chara and won.  . Sunny beat Frisk after an intense knife fight.  . Sweetheart beat Asgore with her mace.  . Papyrus was accidentally rammed by Pluto, who happened to pass by.  . The rest of the underground was cleaned up by Captain Spaceboy, his space pirates, and the Hooligans.. . And thus Undertale was surpassed by OMORI.. . EDIT: It was DETERMINATION that prevented OMORI from succumbing in his battles.,24
We did it gamers,13
Omori being above Undertale is REALLY serious stuff.. . And accurate, in my opinion.,5
IT PASSED UNDERTALE?,9
that's so cool ❤️,4
That's good, I guess.,4
YOOOO LETS FREAKING GOOO! Oh and it also passed Undertale somehow? Ah well 2 of my fav indie games on top 6 les goooo!,4
Honestly?. Omori deserves to beat undertale in my opinion. And I absolutely love undertale. But every single aspect of omori matches undertale, with the only exception being the combat. The combat of undertale is much more fun that the combat of omori. But the music of omori is on par with undertales, the writing and story are far more relatable on a personal level, the game is way longer, has a lot of replayability, and most of omori’s endings are phenomenal. Undertale is cool and all but holy fuck I doubt anything will surpass how I felt during the sunny route bad ending,5
The fuck is an omlri??,3
It beat undertale lmao,3
5 places lower than it should be but this is still good,3
How is Terraria a RPG ?,3
It’s also #7 in “pixel graphics”,3
KEL passes to OMORI. . OMORI feels HAPPY!,3
amazing!,3
awesome, i cant wait for it to get called overrated even more now,3
I love how comments are surprised Omori surpassed Undertale but here I am giggling that dishonored sits right between them.,3
I don’t think it can beat terraria,3
Wooooaaaoooaaoooooooooooooooo. Story of undertale,2
Is Omori or Undertale cuter?,2
terraria is first !. . nice. . favorite game but omori is very cool,4
Better than undertale confirmed 😳😳😳,2
holy hell it beat undertale LOL,1
Terraria is NOT an rpg,1
I think Terraria is way overrated. This is just my opinion, but the whole 10 hours I spent on this game made me wanna do something else instead of that. The graphics and gameplay are just so… ordinary. I would rather have Undertale in the top 6 than that game, and I am not a huge fan of Undertale.,1
It beat Fallout NV lmao,1
TIL Terraria is an RPG.,1
LETS GOOOOOO,1
I would say it's top 3 since Terraria, Stardew Valley and Hades are not RPGs, even if they have some similarities.,1
Yet i never heard about this game,1
WOOOHOOOOOOO,1
OMIRI Dishonored SUNNY,1
AW YEA BOYS,1
Omari was pretty good. I thought the game play was Abit meh but the story was the best.,1
New Vegas should be higher up than that.,1
Undertale is right below it.,1
Everyone talkin bout undertale but how new Vegas 10th place?,1
Terraria is number 1,1
terraria is barely even-,1
Lol I Don't See Deltarune Ch. 1 Or 2 Here Looks Like Undertale Is Better Than Them,1
how tf is terraria an rpg,1
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-,1
Deltarune will be here soon,1
WHAT IT DESERVES!!!,1
I have been unable to sell any of my friends on this game ;-; I just someone to gush over Aubrey with,1
I feel it should stay that way,1
Terraria's existence must be a prank.,1
As it should be 😤,1
YESSS,1
Congratulations everyone!!,1
How tf did we pass undertale,1
NOICE,1
Dishonored is considered an RPG by Steam?,1
Heck yeah!,1
Yo why aren’t omori and undertale and deltarune at the top.,1
"Close your eyes, you'll be here soon. Ichi ni san shi go fun. Tokidoki, hontou ni netai. Demo, kono waado dekinai",1
It surpassed new vegas,1
yayy!,1
Why the fuck is Dishonored #7???,1
I didn’t know terraria was a RPG, but I guess that makes sense.,1
Damn I don’t know how to feel about mount and blade getting a better rating. . . On one hand mount and blade warband is a masterpiece. . On the other is depression. . I’m gonna go play Omori now,1
obviously 1 is terraria a top-notch game,1
I expected deltarune to be in the top 10,1
The bastards actually did it. they beat Undertale,1
How the fuck is terraria an rpg?,1
Of course it beat Undertale in reviews. I haven't seen a single person who dislikes Omori, but Undertale was sorta controversial.,626
We did it guys,40
AND NEW VEGAS !!??,7
I'm not surprised, OMORI is much longer and better, undertale didn't make me cry (I'm still crying when I hear... The music in the ending... You know, I don't wanna spoil anything).,5
If it surpasses Terraria one day the universe will collapse lol,2
[deleted],1
IKR!,1
Legit can AND can't believe that.,1
I was going to say the same thing!,1
HOW THE FUCK DID IT DO THAT?,1
Honestly I’m really proud of everyone who worked on the game. Especially considering all the controversy that surrounded how long it took… the wait was obviously worth it.,201
I am so proud of the comunity but terraria counts as an rpg? also terraria is my favorite game besides omori so my number 1 favorite game is number 6 and second faborite is 1,10
Where do you see that? I'm curious to see the other games,1
Kel feels his best, but he hasn't flexed.,136
It's based on reception rather than the number of people who've played it I think.,199
Its not that its necessarily more popular, its that the ratio of positive to negative reviews are much better.. . Oh and it has enough reviews to constitute its position.,64
It isn't more popular just has better reviews ig,1
Poggers,28
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),48
Not sales,63
As someone who enjoys both games a lot I have to say, deserved. I still prefer Undertale combat, aswell as the option to spare people. Also Undertales funny parts are better on average than Omoris. Also I love the amount of easter eggs.. . In more or less every other category Omori would take the win (however its hard to compare the two, they are pretty different in the end). . Oh and art style is tied because I can't decide,34
metacritic,1
It's not, steam categories are added by the users and are often incorrect because of this.,13
[deleted],16
Undertale is pretty controversial,9
>Papyrus was accidentally rammed by Pluto, who **then apologized for this since he is a chad and not a jerk who says “you’re in my way”, and was instantly forgiven by the equally chad Papyrus**.. . Fixed that for you.,13
You mean 4,1
RPGs are generally catagorized through a system where you start off weak and slowly build up with new equippables, items, etc. For example, Minecraft is an RPG,8
You're Awesome!,3
Omori  . Dream Aubrey beats everyone except teh TeMmIEs!,2
...yes it is,4
Prob just your personal preference - I have over 300 hours on Terraria and it's def in my top 5 games of all time,7
Everyone's taste on game is not the same at you, and none of both is objectly right. . Not every game is for every one.,2
I bet it was the cave bats,2
I'm not so sure about Hades but I'd say that Terraria and Stardew Valley are RPGs  . . . it really depends on what aspect of the RPG genre you're looking at though, it's super vague at this point,7
To be fair I’ve never heard of Hades,1
Lower than stick of truth?,1
Terraria is classified as a sandbox RPG for its progression and combat systems,1
Do you say that in a mean way or....,1
Undertale's community has been... uhh... strange in the past, Deltarune can't be reviewed, and Omori was released in december 2020 while Terraria was released in 2011,2
rpg is a pretty broad term,1
Wait why was Undertale itself controversial?? . . I mean I understand *the fandom* being a huge mess but that’s not a reason to criticize the game itself, even if it can sour one’s opinion on it,461
[removed],13
better listen to [this]() as well,13
Undertale is no more! /s,1
[removed],7
Honestly, no way. Terraria is one of the best games of this decade, period.,12
I don’t know, there was just something about Dishonored that made me go like “wow, this is fun as hell” and put a decent amount of time into it. I played on the Xbox, and it just felt and worked so well. 2 was alright, just didn’t feel that different, which may have been for the best, since the original was good.,8
I'm kinda happy that I found out about the game right when it came out, and played a few months later because I'm not patient enough to wait for that long. However, I would've loved to see the game grow.,75
“A delayed game is eventually good, a bad game is bad forever.”. - Shigeru Myamoto,42
Terraria is considered an rpg because there are roles you play, such as magic, melee, summoner, and ranger. Equipment changes stats so that’s the primary reason it’s labled as such,4
When he flexes it’ll become number 1,40
casual oneshot/omori enjoyer,62
This is due to the combination of Omori's overwhelmingly positive reviews and its very healthy fanbase.. . I hope the fanbase continues to be like this :),22
good bot,11
good bot,3
Worst bot,1
For now!,16
doesnt that make every game an rpg tho?,29
I mean, yeah? But at the same time, while the rpg genre definition is quite loose, I don’t think that just because you play as a certain character it’s automatically an rpg from a genre perspective. That could apply to a lot of games that may not even share any other common attributes of rpg games.. . An example would be dishonored, since it’s in that list too. Does it have some rpg elements? Yeah. Is it an rpg? I wouldn’t categorize it as such.,4
Xcom 2 is an rpg bois.. . Now, hades does have some of the other rpg elements (interactions with persistent npcs, personal upgrades, etc) but these are really not the mechanical core of Hades (roguelite action dungeon-crawler), nor do they have the reach and effect you expect when you call it “An RPG.” It’s like calling a roguelite a roguelike for more sensitive people. Or like calling RTS preset campaigns (SC, CW, HOI) rpg’s. Make decisions, interact with npcs (nova/whatshisnamethespectre), persistent upgrades for your group, hero characters that must not die. I would bring up warcraft but I haven’t played it myself, only watched some.,3
That's not correct at all.,8
so minecraft is an rpg,1
How?,1
You have successfully aborted Omori's genocide route!. . You got 0 XP and 1000 GOLD and 25000 CLAMS.,1
I swear we need a word for the genre of games like omori, undertale, mother, paper mario, mario&luigi, oneshot, etc. u can’t just say “rpg” because it’s too broad but there’s no other word. the specific things I can think of that they all have in common are so limited, but one is that you can’t rotate the camera manually? idk someone come up with a word,7
Thus the “this is just my opinion”,2
About 10% those flying fucks,3
I did and it’s supposed to be great but i also didn’t play it,1
but you don't have a role you play so how is it a role playing game,1
Terraria is not an RPG and it can't be a better game then most of the others on the list.,1
Eh. Good point.,1
Yeah. All games are vulnerable to review bombing.,152
Exactly. But I'm sure that didn't stop some people.,275
The fandom, that's it. People literally getting mad because a video game is popular. It's crazy.,83
contrarians,19
I can see (albeit I also have) some issues with undertale as a game. While the combat system was innovative and great for storytelling, it got pretty boring quickly on following play throughs, which is a death sentence for most JRPGs. The fact it didn’t kill undertale entirely speaks volumes for the rest of the game, though.,20
Undertale is only good if you like the characters imo, the reason it got so popular is because a ton of people liked the characters, if you don’t, then undertale can come across as a generic “friendship good” game,9
accidentally deleted my reply (said my main gripe with undertale was that the combat got bad after your first playthrough) but i think the worst part of the game in general is that it isn't very repayable. you beat it 3 times and then maybe look at all the easter eggs for yourself if you really want too, which isn't too bad but still the main downside.,28
Sadly because of how human psychology works a lot of people are going to conflate those feelings, and the fandom being controversial means the game will be too.,2
[deleted],2
its boring,2
[deleted],-4
I thought the gameplay was fun but the story was meh,1
I think it's because Undertale has more mysteries that haven't been fully solved while omori comes in with mysteries hitting with the hardest answers making the game more suspenseful, but it's only a guess cause I'm only saying this from watching how other people play the game plus it could be vice versa if I'm being honest cause to me both games are good,1
undertales message is stupid,1
I will say, OMORI could use an option to super-speed through text or flat out skip cutscenes. I’m on my fourth and fifth play-throughs of OMORI right now (cleaning up achievements on SUNNY’s route, and setting up a hikikomori route to show my friend the bonus bosses bc we are playing a SUNNY route together) and the dialogue (especially for side stuff) tends to drag on after the second playthrough lmao,7
It's not my favorite but one of my favorite games, thanks for explaining for me why people are so surprised ^^ I didn't look at that from this perspective,2
I hate to do this to you but terraria is over a decade old,11
terraria sucks ass,1
[deleted],0
Oh okay then,1
all hail the power of kel,17
oneshot... haven't seen anyone talked about it since the like 2 years,17
[deleted],7
fandom wise- undertale is a mess, they went out of there way to harassed someone because they said sans would lose in a fight against a Touhou character,19
RPG should rightfully refer to those kinds of games. Imo it's only an RPG when it has a coherent plot and does not overly focus on exploration (like the modern Zelda games).  . . . Edit: involves some sort of battle system, functional or vestigial,3
Ah yeah, fair. I guess I found ur words a bit harsh.,1
Following that logic Minecraft is not an RPG then although it is tagged with being one so IDK I have gave you what I know,1
Sounds like cave bats got ya,1
Wait until Omori receives the same treatment,14
I thought Undertale was interesting because it challenged completionist-type players who like to see all the endings, among other things.. . >!Because completing a Genocide Run essentially “taints” one’s game with Chara’s spirit, any pacifist run done afterwards is [ruined by Chara’s presence.]() The game remembers what you did previously and there’s consequences for it, which means if you wanna see everything there is to offer, you gotta be willing to hyuck up your game… which I think is cool.!<. . I also just like the idea in general that killing things has consequences. Undertale isn’t unique for that, but it’s one of my favorite tropes. I always wonder about what the fantasy enemies are doing in their spare time while they wait for the heroes to show up, so it’s nice when it’s addressed in neat ways.,26
I don't get what you mean. You say "it isn't very replayable", right before admitting there's enough content for 3 seperate playthroughs. . . . Am I missing something?,132
Ah yes, the story based touching RPG that has major themes about NOT changing shit and leaving people happy is bad because it has bad replayability?,7
The fact that you’re downvoted for just sharing an opinion. I love Undertale. It’s probably one of my favorite games of all time, and I see nothing wrong with what you said lol,13
But the combat is better than OMORI lmfao,16
How exactly is it trash? Could you please tell?,2
Haha we're living in the '20s now aren't we. . fuck me,9
Dishorned is a well known game. You just don’t know it,4
Oh, I thought you were being a little sarcastic when talking about Dishonored, it really isn’t a unknown game, it was actually a well received game, and I would recommend playing it. Lots of replay ability. I apologize for the confusion.,3
That game spread pretty far and then it stopped with the end of Markiplier’s playthrough of the game. Nico isn’t going to be saved, unfortunately.,9
[deleted],55
That's the stupidest shit I've ever read, and I had to laugh at it,5
but i personally think oneshot fits into the category I’m making in my head and it doesn’t have battles,2
i also don't think minecraft is an rpg - it's a sandbox game,1
Nah it's nowhere near as big. The omori fandom already screeched out when some big youtuber wanted to play it so the connection there is lost. "Don't stream/play Omori" is the message they all sent out so :))))))))))))))),54
Afraid that's gonna be a while fnf is getting that rn,5
nah nah nah omori can't get the same treatment as undertale fandom legit omori can't just can't. if theres like some messed up shit like on a new type of level like omoris jumpscare but omori fandom shit messed up or something god damn that's my worse nightmare other then something,2
All the og's need to stick together, keep out the toxic haters,1
The same complaint can be levied against omori tbh. I don't really get it. Replayability is more of a plus than a necessity for narrative driven games.,65
I guess it specifically isn't as replayable gameplay wise, kinda like Portal and other puzzle games since most fights can be solved the exact same way every time with ease. I don't really care to argue so if you have any other counter to that keep it to yourself.,0
Undertale is brilliant, but it has its flaws.. . What the original poster is probably trying to say is, once you beat all 3 playthroughs, there is absolutely NOTHING left to discover. You know the charm that makes Undertale Undertale.. . Another flaw that I had with Undertale was the graphics which weren't exactly the best in my opinion.,-10
There is also the lack of the hard mode, felt just lazy to throw some in there and never finish it,-9
never said it was bad whiny ass,-1
oops deleted b4 seeing this,3
kind of agree, but i just wish it had a bit more strategy other than just attack or do one action,3
[deleted],0
SenseiTomatussy when,0
Oh, guess i just dont play rpgs often,2
You are being sarcastic, but every game after the first includes a create a skater with attribute tokens you spend on improving your stats as you progress.,11
U joke, but u are technically correct,1
Sad but it’s true, I’m not shitting you, they pitched yukari vs sans, yukari won, undertale fans got pissed, the video got deleted along with the channel because of said harassment.,4
Battles aren't really necessary, but it DOES put the game in a grey area.. . Take Yume Nikki for example. That thing doesn't even have battles (to the best of my knowledge).,1
Fuck that, I stream that shit on hits of LSD. now I'm so committed to doing it that way and won't play/progress till I trip again,18
Hm,4
the thing about omori though is that a lot of things are completely optional and by doing all of them you've already spent 100+ hours on the game, although undertale has hardly any option on what you do and is very linear and short,11
That doesn't make sense either. . . > once you beat all 3 playthroughs, there is absolutely NOTHING left to discover. . I mean ...yeah? When you go out of your way to experience all the content a game has to offer - there will be no more new content to experience by the time you're done with the game. That's not something exclusive to Undertale - that's just how consuming any media (or anything, frankly) goes.. . I have no idea how this is being framed as a negative. It's literally a "you-can't-have-your-cake-and-eat-it" scenario. . . Moreso, it's like going to a dinner party where everyone is being offered a singular piece of cake, then eating three pieces in a row before pointing at your empty plate and saying "Why isn't there anymore cake?". Like, mate - you've eaten three times the amount anyone else got. You're really gonna complain about not having a fourth? [There is no such thing as an eternal cake.](). . I've gotten too hung up on this cake allegory. Moving on.... . > You know the charm that makes Undertale Undertale.. . This seems like a different criticism altogether - one I don't think really has any bearing on replayability. . . You could argue that each separate route doesn't have enough new/different content to distinguish themselves from the other routes. I mean, I'd personally disagree with you if you did think that (the OP for the comment I was originally replying to just did, I think) - but you could certainly make a case for it.. . But if your point really is "The game loses its charm after you beat all three routes" then I don't particularly think that's a problem with the game per se - I think that's just largely you getting bored with the game after playing it three times in a row lol.. . > Another flaw that I had with Undertale was the graphics which weren't exactly the best in my opinion.. . Can't blame you there. While I personally reckon the art-style is utilised well enough (and expresses enough personality for the characters and yadda yadda etc etc) - it is definitely a 'simplistic retro-style' sort of artstyle that a bunch of indie RPGs use nowadays. I can see how it can turn one off, pretty much.. . ^^holy ^^wall ^^of ^^text, ^^batman!,18
Bro there are so many endings . The main three are cool yeah but the neutral route has so many variations . And there are things that change after repeating certain routes too,2
The Kel Nuke? What's that? Can you give me a link to that strategy?,4
It really isn’t that big of a deal, not everyone is going to know about Dishonored. I would say that you were right, that Undertale is probably more well known, this chart was just based on reviews. Dishonored is 9 years old now, so it is not unreasonable what you thought.. . Edit: Almost completely screwed this comment up by writing it is a big deal, instead of isn’t. Whoops!,1
Tbh Dishonored is not even an rpg, at least not like the others in the list. It’s an stealth-assassination immersive sim, it’s among my favourite games (specially dishonored 2). Worth checking out imo.,1
And now, we need a tony hawk mmorpg,15
Oh my word. I'm genuinely curious on how this went for you if you completed it.,1
also a lot of the secrets are either rng based or kind of convoluted while not being too far off the beaten path as opposed to the yume nikki fan's blessing that is omori's side content,6
The closer I am to death after playing a game, the more I get for my money’s worth.,3
What exactly doesn't make sense? The thing that makes Undertale good is the meta behind it and the fact the game knows it's an RPG. Take it away and you have a very bland experience.. . In comparison to OMORI, you may beat both routes and still find easily accessible secrets.,0
Good point, actually one that changed my stance on this matter.,1
you make kel happy or ecstatic, give him coffee, use a ball that ups his speed, and use run-n-gun (use flex for even more damage)  . see [this]() for more info  . it can deal 8000+ damage on late game bosses,6
The Chicken Ball is the key to this strategy with its 200 speed addition.,1
Oh, that makes sense. Ive only been into gaming for round 5 years and never really got into rpgs. Never even played undertale, omori was really all that caught my eye. Ik other old games but never even heard of dishonored,1
I'd buy, tbh,2
It was a wonderful experience. I did finish it, I made it a goal to only play while dosed so it took a little bit but yeah, it was a fantastic journey tbh,1
Well I personally quite liked Undertale’s story, characters, soundtrack, and sense of humour too, but lets apply your logic here to Omori. . The best thing about Omori is the story and characters, take those away and you’re left with a pretty generic indie rpg, and the RPG part of Omori was significantly less interesting then Undertale’s,7
Also hard mode is a thing which is cool. So yeah,1
the rationale is that run-n-gun is dependent on Kel's speed, which can be further boosted by coffee, the happy emotion, and flex.,2
Understandable, I am the same way. Never played Undertale, haven’t played Omori yet because it isn’t on console yet.,1
OMORI can hold its ground without the story and without the characters. The RPS battle mechanic is interesting and unique and provides for fun battles, even when the bosses lack in difficulty.,0
The thing is that hard mode is of the same length as the demo, so I'm not sure if it checks out.,1
It is yeah, but it’s still a fun additional thing you can do,1
I like how you made Aubrey smile,394
>!the only canon timeline where everyone in this picture can be together :(!<,174
and maybe this time they all can wear socks without dream police getting involved,79
Considering how fast it sold out, dreaming about wearing the merch is pretty accurate,46
Aaaaaaaa I love it soo much,35
awesome! i love the small details you added.,14
Tall headspace Aubrey is kinda cursed o.O. . Cute tho,26
cute,12
I love the little details you added. Omori's default expression, Kel with milk instead of OJ... but Aubrey, that's some attention. Her normal peppy smile, no more spikes on the bat, no bracelet or band-aid, the change to the ribbon... If the faces on Omori's shirt were reversed and Basil was wearing his flower crown this would have been perfect, but this is still a great job!,7
Wow, you predicted the future!,8
Seeing Kel being so fricking tall in Headspace throws me off-,6
Just set this as my wallpaper,3
now draw them in blackspace lmao,3
Is it okay if I use this as a header on Twitter? I’ll credit you in my bio if you have a Twitter account or I’ll just credit your Reddit!,2
Basil looks... Lost... I feel like it might be a *warning* (i like the art a lot!!),2
This is really beautiful but man does it make me sad.,2
I love this ^^^ used it as desktop background 🌸,2
This is very good, though i think i shouldnt look at the drawings since i didnt finish the game yet,2
But what about Basil's flower crown??,2
After beating the game I just can’t look at headspace the same way. No matter how cute it still feels like a knife to the gut >!or falling on pieces of a broken violin!<,2
&#x200B;. . ,2
What a shittty fanat, al you did is just cop offical image and recolor. Lazy af,-72
easiest karma of his life,1
and milk instead of orange joe,211
Honestly though, very small nitpick that does not hinder my enjoyment of this amazing fanart, if this was Headspace Aubrey she prob would look annoyed at Kel putting his arm around her.,22
>!isn't even real. Time to wake up, lil brother!<,143
It is ok.. My Twitter account goes by the same name as my Reddit account.,2
I forgot about it T-T,2
Well u created an account just to talk shid about my fan art thx a lot man.. . I know this is lazy but I just wanted to do what I could to the community okay?,52
Do it on your own then bitch, also try to improve your grammar while you're at it.,26
Lmao did you just made an account just to tell OP off,20
Doesn’t matter how you do it. If it looks good it’s art.    . . ART IS ART,13
such an amazing brain wow,10
Oh... Nice eyes you got there. . . . . . * CaN i hAve iT?,92
>!Snap back to reality!<,101
Thank you! Great art :),2
They don't even have any karma wow, they really did create an account just to shit on someone... Get a life bro,35
Probably still better than some of the stuff I made,13
Its a troll. Your fan art is cute, i like it.,5

yep, better thanks basil for helping me out,8
Almost? He literally did,649
I agree with Kel, he is adjusting great,168
Almost? I stabbed my master 28 times,167
>!“I then had to use Kel’s pepper spray on her because she was bullying someone. ~~Still bumbed I couldn’t stab her again tbh~~!<,187
There was no “almost” involved,50
"and i'd do it again if you didnt take my knife",17
"It was just self defense i swear". . - Sunny who just wants his knife back,18
“my bad yall I thought we were playing by house rules not the official rules”,15
Everybody here keeps saying that he did stab her but if he did she would have most likely needed to go to an hospital and Sunny would have been arrested that same day. It was a slash,12
stabbing is optional , but the joke is just there XD.,8
>!'basil wouldn't be in that lake if you gave me back that knife, Kel"!<,9
Don't forget pepper spraying her too!,7
Technically true if you only use the basketball,6
*Which one?* . . Lmao,3
Almost.. right... almost... just almost.......,2
Depends on what you do, but most people did,297
You can choose to not attack with Sunny, only Kel. If you win the fight like this, Sunny will not slash Aubrey. So it's up to the player's choice.,164
It looked like a slash...,52
And you didn't leave him a chance, huh?,81
This is simply Sunny's way of expressing love,66
Actually, it depends. There's a choice of not attacking with Sunny in the fight, only Kel. If this happens you won't stab Aubrey, but she will still flee due to being afraid of Sunny's knife.,21
I wanted the knife back after having to deal with the Pet Rock Champion, honestly.,5
Man. . Reading this without context would be fun,4
I think it's more like a cut.. . If it was a stab, the attack wouldn't be a slash, more like a impacted poke.,149
So you can keep the knife the entire playthrough? Broken,74
it was,12
Can confirm, he was bleeding and begging for mercy but I stabbed him again and again and again,52
>!committing assault?!<,64
>!Basil clearly understood this too, and reciprocated it!<,4
Bro has some messed up kinks,2
Let’s be real, Everyone stabbed her our first go,44
Nah, when that happens Aubrey gets scared and runs off, then Kel still takes it saying something along the lines of "you shouldn't be walking around with a knife",160
He was trying to say that a slash is different from a stab, Sunny only slashed Aubrey, if he had stabbed her she would probably have gone to a hospital and Sunny would be sleeping in prison space.,35
I tried to shoot with with my gun to stop it but i fired and I missed and then I fired again and I missed again…,17
Also I fired and I fired and I missed. I missed both times,14
did you feel anger? hate? just say “i killed him”. is that so hard to say?,12
Yes.,23
“obviously, stabbing somebody is a sign that you love them in a ton of cultures.”. . \-a sunburn shipper probably,41
I did but you better believe I reverted saves immediately afterwards,17
Yeah, i did it too. But it's still optional, even though many people (me, included) didn't know at the time.,4
Of course, then you check Aubrey's equipment when you have her in your party, and you get this lovely gem of a description.. . AUBREY's weapon of choice.. More dangerous than a STEAK KNIFE.,141
I mean, you can't deny that that's the fastest way to reach a person's heart, other than a gunshot maybe.,17
[removed],-8
true, but when you look at aubrey's attacks, she never actually uses the bat. she just headbutts or punches you or spits on your shoe. . (still it is pretty dangerous to carry around),98
the quickest way to someone's heart is between the fourth and fifth ribs.,9
Bruh I played it out until she was sent to the hospital but I wanted to see the difference,6
thank you for letting me know,4
But she didn’t go to the hospital at any point,8
I LOVE IT 🥰,288
We must protect the children with our lives,232

they're minors dude,38
PLEASE NO-,28
Both. The incompatibility also matches the fact that they're both like 11 so bada bing bada boom right?,5
I wouldn't say it's canon *during* the game's events, but i wouldnt be surprised if it grew into something more once the two get older,25
I don't think this means that they're canon but I hope so. Please Omocat just say it already they are canon or not??,21

Given that the Omori fandom is a safe space and inspiration for a lot of creative works, from fanfictions to drawings to fanmade music, I'm going to disagree with you. Creative spaces shouldn't have AI slop in it, no matter how benign the generated content may seem. It's literal plagiarism,26

Yes, but when you make fun of them, they feel offended. The reason why I'm bringing this up is because viewpoints aren't set in stone, people's views can and will change over time. Insulting them will only offend them and make them less likely to change their views.,39

Probs because "egg" is usually a term used for people that are trans and just haven't quite gotten the memo yet even if they do/say/believe some things that might be indicative of it (for example, thinking that you would love to be a boy/girl)..  I believe it's mostly used in a past sense: "oh i was such an egg back then" or at someone else in a joking manner.,62
"Egg" is a popular term in the trans community for people who are trans but in denial about it.,28

mmm yummy watermelon. . *let's eat it*,53
based omocat,39
nooooo :c,27
fr tho that watermelon lookin tasty,20
i thought we all agreed not to talk about that scene,18
Omocat: I like to make my characters miserable!. . George RR Martin: I like to kill my characters!. . ~~Hideo~~ Hidetaka Miyazaki: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  . #AMATEURS,16

Sadness,12

Omocat on the right side of history.,1
I'm looking forward to a death battle between Omocat and Sr Pelo since Sr Pelo says he wants to do the opposite with his creations.,176

*Some may call us criminals, but we prefer the word vigilantes*,54
do you mean its a different hat or that theres no hat? Because just having an image of grimm isnt that interesting,2
Omoriboy comic in a nutshell..... . Sorry,19
WHY,7
Yes him. I always mix up the names of Japanese devs ... . FukMuhLayf,7
 \* Glances at Mokey's Show, Johnknee and Ill  and Underpants \*. . You could say that.,72
We must save the flower boy from Omocat,41
If you prefer being call "vigilantes" than you have to call us "pirates" Free to play.,20
Different hat, my one is Grimm wearing my profile pic,1
The only one where the main characters end up happy is the Spooky Month,24
*whatever it takes*,6
you should make that your profile pic, then we can start the Grimm with hat gang,1
Ill would like to have a word with you.,2
Ima do it now,1
Done,1

WHO GAVE THIS MAN A KNIFE,370
-"Let me see what you have!",201
ok im gonna fight sunny w/ >!my gang!<. . >!damn sunny got a pepper spray wtf!<,361
To quote the astute Michaela Laws:. . “YOU’RE SURPRISED I HAVE A KNIFE WHEN YOU HAVE A BAT WITH *NAILS!?*”,164
Average day in London,86
Not too shabby... >!stabby stabby!<,44
Use that award money to fix Aubrey’s spleen :/,42
"Sunny!  Why are you using actual ass weapons?". . "Why did you come at me with a fucking spiked bat yesterday and try to actually jump me with your whole gang today?",39
Oh please Aubrey, don't pretend like ur not holding a f-ing bat with nails in it rn,29
DAMn sunny got a KNIFE,19
*no don't cry my beloved*,12
Knife beats bat it’s just video game logic, when has a club beat a knife?,11
Not like you couldve just bashed my brain with the bonk bat,7
Meanwhile aubrey with a nailed bat which is obviously more dangerous than a knife:,2
And i have an axe,1
i'm confused on how having a knife is noticeable but having a baseball bat with frickin nails isn't,1
Himself,159
Me,74
\-"A KNIFE",140
Nice. . Edit: Welp, it was fun while it lasted 😐,89
My favorite thing about that is that they have the self awareness to realize that, yeah, Sunny pulling a knife or pepper spray is entirely fair game, since Aubrey has a fucking nailbat and they were fighting Sunny and Kel 3-1, respectively.,66
Wait what do you mean there was >!pepper spray!<. . . . EDIT: I do not understand how spoilering works,30
Oi oi oi you got a license for that mate?,51
Nah, it's actually surprisingly hard to hit internal organs meaningfully unless you get lucky and have some proper body body strength. Considering Sunny is rail thin and doesn't exactly get much exercise, he probably only gave her a minor fleshwound. She probably didn't even need stitches.,28
Oi oi oi you got a license for that mate?,63
-“NO!”,115
#NO!,46
You can pick it up >!from Kel's mother's handbag on the second day. It does 500 damage.!<,38
i got me a loicense fer stabbin right 'ere!,22
Why are you disrespecting me bruv,1
Oh.. I just thought spleen was a funny word! :),10
Yeah sir got a loicense right here sir. . . *B Y   T H E   Q U E E N*,50
You will never catch me alive . Stabs himself,3
-"Omg why does he have a knife-",32
Parry this you filthy casual,29
Understandable, have a nice day.,17
Well a loicense is a loicense. Sorry mate, can’t interfeah.. . Bloody hell.. . Bit sad, innit?,38
yea,17
This is Asgore's 9th chance to take care of a child :),500
,260
,91
If he only was able to give up his "duty" of "freeing" the monsters. Tbh living in the underground is not that bad. Imagine that after passing through the barrier you end up realising that Mount Ebott was located in the balkans ,84
Both of them also have some pretty heavy burdens of sins.,48
i just hope asgore don't take basil's soul,10
This is the picture that got me into Omori. I had been thinking about buying it and I saw this and I was like “oh crap!!! I don’t want spoilers!!!!!”. . So I bought it instantly and played it in a couple days,9
. . I forgot where I found this but I think that name at the bottom right its probably its source, here you go,9
BASIL has acquired: a father figure,6
ohhhh,7
Omori undertale crossover when,3
u/bot-sleuth-bot repost filter:subreddit,3
[removed],3
adoption lore,3
This would be so fucking cute, I need someone from either fandom to make a fan comic about this.,3
Ah yes a 7th soul for Asgore,2
OMG,2
what the fuck,2
This post is a repost. . . Original post here: ,2
Not to be that guy, but Basils parents aren't dead, they're just out of the country a lot.,2
,2
That's wild.,2
Assuming this is after they come to the surface, he doesn’t exactly need to harvest souls anymore, so I’m sure he won’t fuck this one up.,185
That is assuming he tried the third to eighth time,53
It is safe since this one doesnt have soul 💀 (I wouldnt touch nor frame my bf >! sister's dead body !< and double traumatize both of us),17
AAH AHH???,25
GODDAMMIT I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT THIS,25
SUNNYS SO TINY COMPARED TO HIM I CANT,17
No.,10
Actually we know it’s bad, they mention that they’re becoming overpopulated multiple times and the water is slowly flowing out of waterfall, forcing onionsan to always sit down because when they stand they’re out of the water,61
well it could be worse.. . Mount Ebott, The Urals,6
What DID Basil do, exactly?. . I saw the ending a few days ago but feel like i missed something about him. I get the cover-up was his idea, but if it was only that its odd he's apologetic towards Sunny specifically when they did it together. Was there something else he feels bad for?,16
More than pray yes,7
I'm not my friend who sent it to me,1
We listen to you ,2
I didn't know it was my friend who sent it to me,1
He can't, Basil is already fucked up.,58
5'2 moment,11
Dear god ,3
His main source of trauma is that >!he thinks Sunny murdered Mari on purpose and he didn’t have the mental faculties to deal with that so he suppresses the reality and makes Sunny out in his mind as a little angel!<,23
now Alphys can't browse her anime bcs it is bloody blocked, and Frisk is fucking hiding from draft,4
You're almost right, but it isn't just that >!he sees sunny as a little angel. That's part of it, but not the whole truth. Both Basil and Sunny created SOMETHING out of their denial of what happened. Something is their scapegoat, they know deep down that it was Sunny, but instead Something replaces Sunny because their young minds can't fathom the truth. They are referencing Something being the one who did all the damage. Something killed Mari, Something blacked out the album with black marker. By creating an antagonist, they can continue to escape from the truth and avoid accepting it. Basil and Sunny can blame something for what happened!<,25
You’ve gotta put the !< at the end too.,9
[removed],-14
He’s not stupid.. . He was just a 12 year old who’s innocence instantly died and he was doing everything he could to claw it back,24
[removed],2
>!The truth photos are a bit weird because it's still Sunny's headspace so it's his perspective framed as basils. So it's what he thinks basil saw/knows about. Although I thought basil knew it was an accident hence why he tried to help cover it up instead of reporting it!<,7
Back to crying I guess.,106
BEAUTIFUL ART 😭,64
I love this! You’re a fantastic artist!,34
Mari. BD: March 1. Shorten it it’s Mar 1. . Mar 1 = Mari. . Now my brain hurts,27
Your art is always great man!,18
I love how you included all the flowers, nice one,14
Love this 🥺!!!,10
I will die for her,7
Really like your style !! Do you have a Twitter ?,7
So beautiful!!!👌😊👍,6
Could someone make this wider for a computer screen background? This art is absolutely beautiful!,5
So beautiful!,3
Love it,4
Love it!,3
This is sooooo pretty,3
Amazing,1
gorgeous<3 love the colors and your soft style,1
I LOVE THIS,1
I found something worthy to download and save, this is so beautiful,1
[here!](),7
Imagine a universe where Mari didnt die. . She would be happy with Hero, supportive with Kel and Basil, a little jealous of Aubrey (in a funny way) because she is stealing her little brother from her, and a great sister for Sunny,286
It would be perfect is Mari's hair was purple,115
So many emotions at the same time... Heh... On one side the art is beautiful and happy but at the same Its really sad knowing what has happened,64
**Great Sis**,39
IT'S SO CUTE— Thank you.,61
As always [this is the source of this adorable art!](),59
pain but mostly cute,28
If fucking only😔,26
Upvote upvote upvote,14
Why must you hurt me this way?,16
Cries in It Means Everything,14
I love it <3,8
Don’t worry everyone, you CAN take pictures of ghosts after all!,7
😭,5
wholesome.,5
This is EXACTLY what I imagined. I’m so glad someone else feels this way.,80
imagine a slice of life anime that is based around this (considering it probably wouldn't work as a game),26
didnt died,17
In that case, only Sunny would be .... ya know... ded,5
>!Getting mad \*once\* was what killed her.!<,3
Kinda looks like dark purple if you focus hard enough,76
Kek,17
looks like blue if you hold your breath long enough,51
r/cursedcomments,14
Aubrey is such a sweet bean. I loved her character. Nice job!,217
Same It's great, I just hope this awesome community doesnt die anytime soon, because I doubt we will get any more content sadly,144
Sunny is just Aubrey's little watermelon,57
This is adorable! I love your style!,27
WE ALL DID. .  ***ADMIT IT***,20
this is too cute i am crying,17
i love how you did the hair!!! been tryna nail that kinda sketchy style for a while now,10
Help, I fell so badly for this picture!!. . ITS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL,9
Naw I ain't gonna help you. You are going to join us brother/sister into this Omori pit hole,10
Could you explain to an aspiring digital artist how you did the hair, ive been experimenting with custom brushes to make a crayon like one to no avail.,6
I was looking at this when mom peeked at my phone. I turned it around and said "no". She said in a teasing tone "come oon~ what could be in your phone that you'd want to hide~" so I showed her. Her first reaction was "aaaw this is actually so adorable!",4
GOOD,4
I love your art! Also Aubrey and Omori is so cute!,4
Damn Omori literally just did 😒,5
THIS IS SO CUTE PLEASE,3
Y E S,3
its literally my favorite game ever,4
nice art :D,3
it's been two months since you've been in the community, how have you coped with the ending :),3
Thank you! And Aubrey too cute, must protect her.,91
The dream aubrey at least...,45
Yeah, hope so too. But I'm really enjoying what we have here, even tho I still have to avoid some spoilers.,64
We may not get any *official* content, but the more talented of us may wonder what an animated version of this would look like, then make that animation. Or they may wonder what a comic/manga version would like, then make it.. . Us fans can do some amazing things. 🙂,45
I hope so too. Lately I've only been entering dead fandoms so I really wouldn't want to lose this one, it's so amazing,7
I thought Basil was sunny's little watermelon?,28
Thank you!,15
The moment I started doing fanart I knew it was too late. Oh well, you guys seem cool, so I won't complain.,3
I use pencil brush (procreate pencil) and draw strokes exactly the same how I would do it on paper with real pencil.,4
Aaawww, that's so nice. It actually made me happy.,6
I love you both,4
he's hust playing the not interested guy, but actually he's the one in love with her,4
I don't post much in general, but I'm lurking here quite a lot. I didn't have any big reactions at first when I finished the ending, I think I needed some time for things to actually set in. But then I just couldn't stop thinking about it for the next week or two. I don't remember when last time any kind of media had this kind of impact on me. Man, I really love this game.,4
Irl Aubrey is still a sweet bean 🔫,88
Real Aubrey too, she just needed her friends back,45
Yeah fandoms like LISA are on their deathbed but the fangames and modders are somehow keeping it alive,30
As someone who loved Doki Doki literature club and still does, the fans have kept it going for years. It seems that this fandom is going that direction too, where the dedication from fans and their love for the game keep it alive for years to come. . . also omocat is dope so who knows.,30
I mean if you are talking about  that one room in >!black space!<,39
Irl Aubrey being a sweet bean when she pushes people into lakes and bullies children and fights in churches,9
The DDLC community has kept itself alive through sheer fucking willpower,26
>!Yeah thats what I was refferring to!<,20
Did you completely miss her redemption arc,23
The Mother fandom though,3
Nah she's wonderful and deserves the world for the shit she's been through but she's definitely not a sweet bean. She is sometimes but most of the time that sweet bean is covered in landmines and nails because she puts on a face so often,7
I wonder what Basil would call it...,219
What would >!Mari!< call this?,359
Mari would call a mistake a slip up,113
Oof LMAO, sadge bruh moment,214
Inspired by u/Side-Character-A [post](),67
It was such a bruhmomentsadgeooflmao,25
How to put a spoiler censor in my comment,22
What is "sadge",20
Poggers,33

“Big L”,9
basil: unhappy accident,8

I always called it a mental scar,9
Nonono its definitely called a bruh moment,3
I’d like to disagree it is a oof lmao,3
OoOf LmAO,2
Oof LMAO,2
I like how Hero seens upset, Kel  awkward, Sunny ashamed while Aubrey has a face of "I recognize that what I did was not too kind, but this doesn't means that I regret it all....or that I haven't enjoyed the moment",1
I call that a “Bruh moment “,1
An "it's my fault",345

If you don’t know then you need some Thalasin +,4
Alternatively, "everything's going to be okay",149
.... . Yea,28
Damn,17
Aw damn, you beat me to it, by like 9 months,2
kel was included in the meme that brought this about its canon,154
That or "I will give you a singular yike",77
Uhhhhh you aren't wrong,14
oh,26
Oof lmao,28
Lmao,5
So i need to put >!on my comment!< ?,13
Cool,4
I dunno man. I took one of their pills and was feeling a strong sense of dorcelessness for like a week,5
Alternatively, >!something!<,37
I think you might want to look at the post again Aubrey,14
yep!,8
dorcelessness looks scarily similar to Omori when furious,3
Cool,6

Oh! I get it. . Coz they're both >!girls!<,391
they are hanging out together,858
The Good Ending,276
what a random duo! i wonder why someone would put them together…,211
Aww, they should totally hang out together! ,349
.... . .... . .... . Is there going to be a "bad ending" version of this?,91
The image is not loading for me because of poor wifi connection but i know exactly what this meme is about and i hate it,118
phew i was really worried ,104
Wait ,24
I hate you I thought it was something else ,27
Spoiler alert spoiler alert! Woo woo woo woo. >!Both of they are hunged dead!<,52
Hey, it’s been a moment, does Sayori live in a two story house?,21
this junction can have a chaotic ending....,19
only thing they have in common 100%,15
,12
,14
Ignoring the dark jokes (which I do in fact find funny) These two would 100% be best friends,12
Good to see two precious beans *hang* out together.,10
,9
wow, what a funny meme. . oh hey, my pizza's here!. [i slowly open the door],10
yeah...that's the only thing they have in common...yup...,7
I haven't played OMORI, but something tells me that Sayori and Mari have something else in similar...,7
Let's be honest. . Sayori > every DDLC character,7
Sayo-,8
phew,6
Hold up, wait a minute, something ain't right,6
Yea!….wait…….oh no…..,5
there is an alternate version of this meme,6
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one,5
,5
There's another thing...,6
This is so sweet, they should really hang out together,4
,5
You gently push open the door,6
You were on thin fucking ice,3
That was not the joke I expected, and I'm happy about that,3
As a man that's in the doki doki Fandom and the omori Fandom I love this,4

I thought it was going to be something else.... . Them trading outfits, obviously.,3
There should be more comics of them hanging out, they just seem to have a lot in common,3
You got us from the first half ngl,3
I'm so glad that didn't go how I expected it to,3
I thought this was going in a completely different direction for a second.. . I mean, I'm not complaining. These two games already traumatized me, I'd rather not be traumatized^(2).,3
mari and sayori the beloveds ,3

i was enjoying the meme and these two are precious and would be good friends. . then i checked the comments,1
ngl I didn’t expect that,1
if you know you know…,1
Ah yes, for this they are comparable,1
And I thought it was a post about them hanging out together,1
I haven’t played omori yet and I don’t know this character so I thought I was about to get spoiled a character hanging themself,1

How the >!omori fight should have gone!<,207
might as well use a violin as a weapon,74
Sunny increasing his KDR,51
I don't know, pal. 𝕭𝖔𝖙𝖍 look correct to me.,41
*The violin is now destroyed*,19
Trombolin,15
I'm pretty sure it's the other around, dude.,9
I mean, he hasnt played in four years, hes rusty,10
   Violinist here, can confirm,5
Omori fighting game,12
Wait, I've been doing it wrong all this time?,6
This hurts my soul,3
OOOH that's how you use a violin. Ok thanks for that,3
Both sound correct to me-,3
Throw it down a stair case.,3

Ah yes, I thought it was time to get a new bat, I’ve had it for 4 years. How about a violin?,2
This is the best most blurred image on this subreddit,1
I've been doing it wrong the whole time,1
both, both are correct.,1
>!This is now canon!<,138
This is exactly how I remember it,55
Intended use vs murder,13
Yup. All this time. Although I'm not sure if you can put them under staircases, have to check-,2
Kel is in the meme, so of course it is!,76
and to yeet the person to outer space,4
If it's murder on purpose, it's still used as you intended,2
But what about the person who made it? Did they intend for it to be used exactly that way?,2
>as **you** intended,2
Wait, ‘our’..?,158

COMMUNISM  BABYYYYYY,53
Noo dude I'm sorry for you. But I'm just like you ;-;,31
Bruh, don’t give up though. People out there will enjoy your company. I used to be a bit socially dumb at first but you’ll learn eventually. It can be pretty tragic to just live online.,11
Honestly same, even had my own headspace-ish thing going on,6
Yeah, sometimes I just wanna quit from everything,20
I don't know how I did it but one time I managed to b dreaming, wake up, go pee, fall back asleep and continue the dream were I left off. But it was just that one time.,13
The solution is easy, inject yourself the sleeping chemichal (and some nutrients) my neighbour uses while you sleep, then you should be able to create a dream world and live in it until the chemichals and nutrients are over,4
Yep me too.,22
make one. nobody can stop you as long as you dont take the pills they force down your throat and the corn syrup they want you to take with them.,14
Tbf it seems he’s not being a brat right now, I think it’s fine.,6
Buonasera anche a lei,1
Well it’s a very good meme; nice one,45
I have very big concern, is your friend a real person or is it an alter ego created after playing this game ? After seeing the meme I'm pretty sure is the second one,11
yess comrade.,38
aw hell yeh,18

You have the power of gods.,5
I'm not sure I should take advice from someone who fucks dragons,10
HOW DO YOU FIND FRIENDS FOR A FRIEND GROUP,3
Thanks so much i'm very happy you appreciated it,35
Hello I am the "alter ego" or the friend.... Who knows?,10
Oh come on, yeah i fuck dragons, but are you a dragon? No, right? So no problem, trust me in this buddy,4
stop taking your medication and listen to the voices. they will be your friends when nobody else will,6

Hey, if you're actually 11 don't go around telling people on reddit, or anywhere else on the internet, bad stuff can happen.. . Edit: Mission accomplished, let's keep children safe around here if we can.,95
so i'm really not trying to sound condescending here (like i get it, as a kid i was lying about my age to get in sites i shouldn't be on yet too) but maybe don't be on reddit?. . there's some very adult content on here. sometimes without any warning. not to mention that to use reddit, you have to be at least 13, so you might get banned.. . and your age is personal information! just like you shouldn't go around sharing your full name online, you should not share your age either. i know the internet feels safer now, but there are still a TON of bad people online, and nowadays it's even easier to track someone down. just be careful.,62
**Druid Transformation: Piano**,43
Suddenly pianos,1
Aubes must.,11
Idk I've never played omori,5
Also pretty sure Reddit is 13+,55
This this this! I’m above the age to use Reddit and it still feels a little too old for me, in a way. The fact thst sometimes I just get… videos of dead people. Makes me feel like I’m too young sometimes.,12
Basil’s the party druid. Sunny’s a rogue, Hero’s an alchemist artificer who reflavors his potions as food, Aubrey’s an Oath of Vengeance paladin, Mari’s a bard, and Kel’s a homebrew Way of the Space Jam monk.,12
i am pretty sure Omori is 18+,39
No it's not,23
16+ ?,23
Pretty sure it's actually 13+ but heavily heavily reccomended to be 16+,14
Yeah probably,13
At least in the US, there isn't any kind of law against any age playing Omori, but the target audience is probably around 16+.,8
Sunny wouldn't have the strength for this. Aubrey is the perp here,695
"Ah shit, here we go again". . &#x200B;. . "nah nah nah bro, this is your problem now... see ya". . &#x200B;. . *Basil is gone*. . &#x200B;. . "F\*ck". . &#x200B;. . "Really, again!?",310

Snuuy's fate is cursed. Sooner or later, Everyone except omori will be on Mari's picnic mat.,75
"This Summer, Sunny and Basil are back for one. last. job.",54
Honestly this sounds more like Aubrey's thing than Sunny's.. . Dude has been a malnourised house hermit for 4 years, he doesn't have that kind of strength.,57
And then Aubrey just haunts him while Mari laughs up in heaven.,34
Ten years after the events of the first game, Sunny accidentally kills Aubrey and now he has to fight an advanced version of Something called Everything.,29
I know the intent of this post, but I find it more funny and more in character for Sunny to be the one killed in this context.,25
You guys treating it like that poor wall could withstand Aubrey's head lol,27
oh hell nah bro, ig we are not gonna play from sunny's perspective then,23
"Your girl"?. . Mf sunny ain't pullin no hoes 💀💀💀🗿🗿🗿,34
 Do I HAVE to imagine it?....,15
: It didnt even hurt dont worry. . : Aubrey you breaked all the fucking wall,17

this is so absurdly funny to me because it legitimately almost happened.  . . Threw her back and she slammed her head on brick. Blood and a huge knot ensued. Thankfully, she was into that kinda thing.,7
That's unforgiveable ,6
basil: \*walks in\* ay dont worry bro, i gotchu just help me with this real quick,6
The way I saw this headline, had a heart attack that there was going to be an omori 2, only to be trolled… it’s my 13th reason.,5

is that a reference, i swear i heard that somewhere,5
Basil's last words were "Harder, mommy",12
Hero: I am not crazy! I know he killed her too. I knew it was 12/16. One after Magna Carta. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that idiot flower boy to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. Like Mari! Are you telling me that she just happened to die like that? No! He orchestrated it! Sunny! They hung her dead corpse! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. Rescued him from drowning! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't take responsibility for his actions! But not our Sunny! Couldn't be precious Sunny! Killing them blind! And HE gets to be a free man? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you, you have to stop him! You -,19

Yes,but Sunny is basically Deku without the part where his attacks are actually strong.. . Sunny just breaks bones.,78
For the first season and a half. After that he finally learns how to not break his bones after throwing a single punch,16

it feels illegal that Mari wasnt included...  ;-;,524
>!because we don't see omori i like to think any time sunny visits omori is still in child form looking up like "howdy partner" !<,471
For me I headcanon that. . . Sunny: journalist. . . Basil: florist/book reviewer as a side job. . . Kel: kindergarten teacher (originally basketball player, but he twisted his ankle). . . Hero: pediatrician. . . Aubrey: social worker (cps),244
himbo lmao. . great fucking work, this is amazing.,104
kel beard kel beard i love art goddamn,90
>!Didn't Basil and Sunny both lost an eye!<,87
I mostly agree, but I headcanon that Aubrey realises there’s demand for her skills as a handywoman and she becomes a tradeswoman (maybe a plumber or a builder?). . P.E teacher Kel is brilliant, though. I bet he doubles as a secondary counsellor at the school because he’s surprisingly perceptive of when a kid isn’t doing so well at home,103
My IG : [demo.cat.art]() . . (haven't post these there yet tho),37
No matter the age, Kel is always ballin',35
Can u do mari as a pizza delivery driver,26
Kel looks like he fights bears for fun,19
OH MY GOD PIZZI CATO THATS SO CLEVER I love violin jokes. Super epic!,18
This is really good.,14
Oh no they’re hot,29
I like these!,13
ok i’m aroace but kel is kinda hot 😳,11
Where Mari?,13
What's a social network analyst?,12
Sunny looks lile ren from persona 5 in winter clothes.,11
Hell yeah!! This is AWESOME!,10
Kel's face is similar to Tarzan. I love it,8
I vibe with Snuuy's outfit ngl,10
"a bit himbo?". a lot himbo, fight me,13
I love it I love it I love it,7
this just in, Mari is now the new world champ.,7
Grown-up Kel is uh. . He's very uh. . How to put this. . I want him to accidentally knock me over on the sidewalk then help me up while the sun hits his grin just right and the wind tosses his hair.. . Does that make sense?,8
Kel would be the best P.E teacher in the world.,6
Kel gives me major Theo vibes from Celeste. Idk he just does. This art is fucking awesome btw,5
In my headcanon SUNNY will become a writer of fantastic stories thanks to his imagination.,6
this is so fckin cute im gonna cry,9
Kel got a massive glow up. Can we make this canon?,4
This is awesome, but >!didn't Hero want to become a chef?!<,4
Phys ed teacher kel is brilliant I love that,2
basil looks like a grandma and i’m not averse to that,5
may just be me but kel being a pe teacher and sunny being a violinist seems kinda counter intuitive,5
This is by far the best thing I have ever seen in this sub,3

Femboy Basil 👀,2
Why does Sunny look like JD from Heathers,2
Canon. Period.,2
Sunny doesn’t like the violin so he should have been something else like a self defense expert.,2
Honestly,  i love seeing people takes on how our dearest cast would look like after x years,2
>!sunny having his eye bugs me!<,2
Bearded Kel is great,2
Kel accomplished his dream. . Now he's ballin',2

Mari, an angel(cookies),2
the idea of sunny being a violinist is really heart warming.,2

Imma be honest..if this subreddit has told me anything about the "totally healthy" mindset of all these characters...they'll probably commit Roblox self oof before 10 years..,2
Why does kel look like Jesus,2
They all look like the medic from tf2,2
Kel lowkey got my bussy squirting haha,4
Where's Aubrey's right hand? 🤨,2
a fit PE teacher ?, never would i see the day,1
This looks way better than how they'd acc turn out (but maybe I'm just pessimistic lol),0
**geuss they are legal now**. . **let the games begin**,1
Kel is so real,1
why does sunny has his eye tho 🤔🤔,1
Omg they look so amazing. I totally headcanon this.,1
kel's right arm...,1
Basil became exponentially more feminine,1
mari - dead,1
:0 ,1
In my headcanon Hero is toxicologist (because he looks like Chubbyemu and I don't care that Hero is Mexican and not Asian lmao) and Basil is Guitar Hero streamer (because he looks like JasonParadise).,1
I like the headcanon of hero being in psychiatry/psychology after maris perceived death :,),1
i almost did not realize that was Aubrey, i think it's the hair,1
This is cursed and cool at the same time,1
Man I love Hero,1
Sujny became a persona mc,1
Omg, Sunny looks like a younger, shorter version of Graves from Hustle Cat!,1
Kel can bench press multiple children at once and probably does on a daily basis,1
your grown up version of Kel looks like how OMOCAT draws bo en,1
Sunny reminds me of a certain scene in Spiderman 3,1
And mari? Still swaying in the wind,1
MEU DEEEUS QUE PERFEITO!!!,1
Hero's pocket has a book of jokes, all of them terrible,1
I LOVE THE IDEA OF KEL BEING A PE TEACHER AND HERO BEING A CHILDREN'S DOCTOR,1
>!Im surprised Sunny isn’t missing his right eye, unless he got a glass one later on!<,1
Where is Mari,1
I LOVE MEWO AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSJSJSJSHSHSS,1
god please they look so simpable aaaaaa,1
>!why does sunny have both of his eyes?!<,1
meanwhile, mari in the corner: I'M FUCKING DEAD!,1
Sunny kinda gives me the same vibes as the Persona 5 protagonist,1
Is it just me or does Sunny look like Edwards Scissorhands?,1

Kel's arm is huge!,1

Aubrey looks like Nene from Pico’s school,1

Sunny and Basil wouldn't be here, because they would still be in jail after confessing they tampered with a police investigation/evidence.,1
>!doubt that sunny would enjoy picking up the violin, he never was cut out for it in the first place, he didn't like to practice. and with the added trauma (he repressed the instruments existence in his house for 4 years) iono if this what he needs!<,1
OH NO OMORI TURNED INTO JD,1
Dope art, but considering the time it's unlikely you'd see basil rockin a choker around :D,1
I imagine Hero practicing family medicine. . Kel is perfect 😊,1
I read this as ghost story ,170
So true.,81
she works as minecraft skeleton,721
,84
She's >!an angel now!<,77
She works at Disney land’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride.,18
throwable :),173
like gary coleman,15
Cool, I like your headcanon as well! we both agree with Kel and Hero on some extend hah! Sunny would be interesting to go out of his way traveling around. Basil, obv flower boi. Damn Aubrey would be one scary social worker  . . Poor Kel lmao!!,116
Nah sunny is an attourney,6
>!Sunny just has a glass eye, maybe!<,98
>! Basil didn't. Maybe Sunny has a dark colour glass eye !<,58
>!We don't know wether Sunny's eye can recover or not. Maybe it's just injured and eventually heals just fine!<,36
They got better,5
>!just Sunny actually.!<,2
Eyo the pizza here,9
And wins,16
Heheh thanks for notice the joke ,2
>!don’t worry, she’s just getting pizza for the gang :)!<,43
ouja board,7
Sounds like a good idea for Sunny, he'll be a great surreal novel writer/artist. (This fanart is just my own interpretation, I'm open to read you guy's ideas ),1
Hero wanted to >!become a chef in Headspace because that's what Sunny remembers from Hero irl, but after ***the incident*** he changed his mind and wanted to become a doctor!<,4
He can also be a nutritionist doctor ,6
Aww ,2
lol it's funny my anime style is compared to Persona although I never played the game (They got pretty cool char designs so I'm flattered),2

Must be a browser thing. Works fine on Reddit app and your example is actually not spoilered on the app….   . Fixed it for you anyway though.,16

*Meanwhile in Sunny's unconcious*. . Omori: .... *He's watching in silent Sunny's life through his eyes* ... You grown up a lot, old man. ... Mari is proud of you... I'm happy you became strong without me... You truly are stronger than me,14
I can see the angels…,3
Oh wow didn't even realize that,3
Seconded,2
Lol, when she was younger she would definitely use that bat.,9
Must be. My example wasn't spoilered since it was in a code block. I did that so it would show the formatting.,7

>!He'd kinda get caught with murdering basil tho!<,3
yeah also you fucked up the spoiler tags,2
So every time American stereotypes (usually the ones involving guns) are brought up, Texas is always mentioned. From that, I’m picking up that Texas is the most American state.,22

Fixed it,2
Texans like to think so.,13
As a non American I think Nebraska is the most "American" state.,7
Would be a bit similar to the plot of this old [Swedish song]() right mate?,9
Done,1

As an American, what the fuck is a Nebraska?,5
I wish he was really Swedish.. . The cowbells are calming & in tune though.,9
As a swede, i can say that this is something you hear everyday.,1

,25
What about >!Heroin?!<,37
He must grant his body to Herobrine for an hour every night in order to stay as Hero.,15
How do I get these leaves?,8
If we look at it from the stance that Kel is actually the original user who made a post about Herobrine, then that would be one of Hero's few acts of being a bad older brother. They must all be purged.,7

this is definitely something kel would do,10
A good day to remember that all Kel memes are canon,5

bruh i used to see how small the hole would be before i got stuck . . my hand was too fucking small. . my day was ruined,1
I'd love to see a grown "ass man" for myself,1
Wtf is a Shitotle,95
kel getting trapped/stuck in or on things is probably a semi daily occurrence.,57
it’s normal,9
kel,20
it's not even weird that he tried sticking his finger in the wall in the first place,19
Why would natural selection weed out something as precious as Kel?,26
Because Kel is the ultimate life form,10
he’s a gift from above,3
I’m glad!,4
Just Kel being Kel,5
was only there once or twice, the food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good, either.,33
Considering the crazier stuff he does (remember, EVERY KEL MEME IS CANON), he probably thinks this is low on the craziness that Kel takes part in.,22
What are you doing Hero?,5
Kel,10
I likes Moes more, they have better queso,15
As someone who really likes Chipotle...... yea,8
they just mix up a bunch of ingredients like its babyfood and serve it. beans, veggies, dough. it doesnt feel connect and its just meh.,7

Small Issue. So ya see it's whenever it's ANY instance of the word. 'Close' so right here the bot will reply to this comment and I could see that getting annoying.

Don't worry, already working on it.. . Questions, would you prefer for it to reply only on "close" or any thread like this? I can see it gets kind off annoying everytime someone mentioned close even though the context is different.,3
No problem!,2

I can make it but prefer not to, might be too spammy, also lag.,3

lmfaoooo 💀,22
Imagine outing yourself as an incel,-2
maybe make it so it only replies when closet is by itself (said closet so bot doenst reply lol) as that how most chains start, not in a sentense.,16
maybe also have it avoid it when it says "Close your mouth" so it doesn't do this, or if possible make it only reply to comments with close at the end,6
Make it so it's only when people say "close" and nothing else, that way it can also work on other subreddits that sing it without it being a problem every time someone just says close,4

Fun fact: You can beat aubrey's first fight as if you killed something in headspace if you use the knife at the right time,7
I adore it,6
Looks very crammed ngl,6
Damn, the day after mine,5
I can't tell if Sunny's blushing because Hero is squishing him, because he is being squished into Aubrey, or he noticed Something was at the table,5
Yo this is some sick artwork. . Omg sunny 😆,5

Hello mari but dead i am mari but dream,1
In Super Paper Mario (Wii, 2007), you go to this world called the Sammer's Kingdom to claim a pure heart, but the world is on the verge of complete annihilation by the void that has been looming in the sky throughout the adventure. . . Before you can get the pure heart, the void destroys the Sammer's Kingdom and erases all its inhabitants from existence. When you return to the world after the void destroys it, all that's left is this utterly empty white landscape, with only some sparse, colourless pieces of Sammer's Kingdom being the only remnants. The game forces you to explore this world of nothing for quite a while, with almost nothing to see for the bulk of it, accompanied by one of the most unsettling pieces of music in any Nintendo game.. . Super Paper Mario is definitely an underrated gem in the Wii's lineup of games. Controversial gameplay aside, this game really showcased the unrestrained pinnacle of creativity in terms of story and writing, with the game being witty and hilarious yet not afraid to delve into darker themes on a whim. I personally feel that it has been a source of inspiration for many indie games we've seen in recent years.,13

MEWO stares at you. She does not know what is happening.,6
that’s how he got into smash,18
cause every time I wake up in the mornin' I got garlic on my mind,4
>!I said for peach to be Aubrey since Sunny had a crush on Aubrey, whether is reciprocated or not, and Mario has a really obvious crush on Peach (besides I don’t see Peach as the sort of glass cannon character since in every Super Mario game, where she is playable, she is always the slowest character (like Aubrey)!<,2
You can leave the room without doing that you do know that right?,9
Do you wanna cut open mewo?. . yes. . no,3

I see but.... What if mario accually lokes bowser and uses peach as an excuse and beating each othwr is just being kinky or you know maybe making aubrey peach was rigth,2

Woah, I can’t believe Mari turns into shrek when she’s off screen. That’s so cool!,108
I don’t remember honestly how i got to this theory but I remember it was nearly 100% right. I will try to remember and edit this comment in case. . >!However, mari doesn’t run like naruto, neither she teleports like an abra. Maris at picnics are just clones because omori doesn’t want to let her die and locks every mari in a picnic.!<. >!Edit: after humphrey!<,48
Unironically figured out half the plot when this Mari chick kept teleporting between picnics in the first couple hours,31
Nah, here is what happened.(warning it is kind of spoilery) Mari and Basil like omori are practically the rulers of the dream world. Basil takes up >![blackspace]!<, Mari rules headspace, and Omori rules white space. Since Mari is ruler of headspace she teleports whenever she likes.,48
Nah she's teleport,12
It's true, I've seen it myself,7
Run?...pff Omori's only fastest being is Kel and if he can't get there before Mari then my answer is simple...she teleports.,5
I think she just teleports.. . Considering it's the dream world and all that,7
Broken knee,4
i remember on the first time i saw her in another picnic i knew there was something up with her,2
FREE LIFE JAM (NO VIRUS),2
Well you can move really fast when you're a ghost,2
She took a shortcut.,1
Nah she teleporting,1
Actually the picnic space is omnipresent, her picnic area is everywhere and she exists with it,1
Magic carpet, guys. Magic carpet.. . 🎶I can show you the wooorld...🎵,1
I’m gonna say it again, >!she lied about her bad knee.!<,152
>!wait when did she break her knee? Did I miss that?!<,22
Or perhaps she follows Humphrey logic… but if that were true, wouldn’t that mean Headspace is actually her… you know what, just forget I said anything.,71
Nurse joy is mari confirmed!!!😱 . . Sorry its kinda long TwT. . Theory #1. >!I like this theory alot because if I remember correctly after you finish the spider place mari will be very happy to see you again even though you saw her 5 minutes ago which probably means every mari have different mind but share the same memory with Mari or shes just that estatic about seeing you again , if you talk to the mari near the shark casino she will say she met alot of new people which probably means she's been there for the start!<. .  Theory #2. >!they share the same brain or something like every maris in the game was already on a picnic from the start and they share the same brain so thats why they share the same memory, experience and stuff!<. . Theory #3. >!omori doesn't want to see mari not in a picnic because sunny said picnic is a safe place and omori wants mari to be safe and omori always want to see mari always so omori put maris every where so he can see her!<,10
Mari in her natural habitat,25

I feel like it's more probable that >!stranger rules over blackspace, and while him/her/them are really similar to basil, I think they are two separate entities!<,2
Nothing personnel, pardner.,3
>!She's probably not lying, there's that mysterious voice which talkes about the truth also said she has a broken knee.!<,145
>!Not LITERALLY a broken knee but you probably did, if you run when Mari is in your party (when everyone goes missing) she tells you to stop because she has a bad knee. Also in the end of humphrey when you go get the last key a voice says she has a bad knee so there's picnics to protect her knee.!<,38
>!In real life, she broke her knee playing Baseball. Aubrey's bat used to belong to Mari.!<,31
Expand your mind, Omori!,46
Is her… 🤨,4
Or, y’know, dream logic,12
Oh! Thanks >![TEXT]!<,14
Your welcome lol,3
I used Basil since >! him andd stranger are the same person, just split into 2 in headspace, Stranger represents the stuff that Sunny doesn't want to think about Basil while dream Basil is a perfect version of Basil that is without the bad stuff (ie. Stranger) !<,7
I know, I was only joking.,70
>!Also mentioned in the treehouse if you examine everything, one of the items brings it up, used to play softball but had to quit!<,22

She is from a video game called omori,1
Oop just scrolled down some! Never mind!,1
[removed],4
what fabric paint did you use ?,1
Hi its been over a year, but what fabric paint did you use?,1
Yes, that be me,5
*oh no they have returned*,22
This looks fucking sick! I’ve already played the game but I would buy this.,435
I don't think Omori would get a T rating lol.,208
Sadly the "I fucking love air-conditioning" line breaks the Teen rating,182
Suggestive Themes? What was.... . *Humphrey PTSD flashbacks ensue*. . ...ah.,55
Looks super good, the only thing I’d change is not having sunny on the boxart, I’d think it’d be kind of a spoiler.,149
This is a very well-edited cover! The other comments regarding the mock ESRB rating (mainly jokes about how the air conditioning WTF event would bump it up to an M rating) had me thinking, though. After researching the ESRB rating system's website, I think this rating would be more accurate:. . T (Teen) -  Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, Violence. . Here's my reasoning:. . Blood and Gore - >!When Basil stabs Sunny in the eye during his battle, the icon shows Sunny bleeding. At first I was just going to say "Mild Blood" for this, but then I remembered there is also a sequence in Black Space in which Sunny's fingers are being severed one by one, with both the hand shown on screen and Sunny's overworld sprite becoming more and more bloody. Since there's dismemberment, Blood and Gore it is.!<. . Language - Most in-game dialogue has mild language at the most, but the air conditioning line's strong profanity bumps it up from Mild Language to standard Language. Since this is the only time an F bomb is dropped and not all playthroughs include this line of dialogue, I didn't think it would warrant enough for a Strong Language mark.. . Suggestive Themes - This descriptor is mainly used for mild sexual innuendos which could very well fit the subplot with >!Space Boyfriend and Sweetheart, along with the Slime Girls!<, but it could also fit in the general context of OMORI's dark themes.. . Violence - I was at first unsure whether this game would fall under Fantasy Violence, but the not-so-fantasy scenes in which>! OMORI (and Sunny, depending on the route you take) stabs himself, along with all the Mari business!< changed my mind fairly quickly. Scouring other T-rated games with similar content also labelled this under the Violence marking.. . And why Teen and not Mature? There are many other games with this kind of subject matter that have are rated T, and while there are a couple graphic scenes in the game, I personally thought that they weren't frequent enough to warrant an M rating >!(yes, this includes Black Space)!<. Also, the ESRB wouldn't put "psychological horror" on its label because it only uses descriptors from a set list to save time and give consumers an easy way to judge a game's content. So what do you guys think?,25
I love this cover so much actually, you did amazing on this tbh!,24
Still waiting for the announcement of this for the switch....any day now...,17
I really hope they actually do release a physical version, wouldn't be shocked if they went with LRG for it. Digital games are convenient yes but nothing beats having actually being able to physically own a game.,12
IT HAPPENED!!!,8
Nice!,8
Great art. Made me realize there's no way this game get a T rating lmao. Which is probably for the best, I've had to be pretty particular with who I do and don't recommend it to, and I definitely wouldn't wanna hand this game to a young teenager,7
This is not looking like fan made. THIS IS A FUKING ORIGINAL !!!,4
This looks awesome!,5
"Buy the Omori amibo to gain the ability to run as an extra bonus",4
Future vision,3
I feel like it would be better if the cover had no hints to the scarier side of things in the game so it would just look like a normal rpg game, pretty awesome cover nonetheless,3
holy shit this is so cool,3
why does this looks so legit,3
looks great!! should be M though,3
Ohoooo this aged well,3
This looks fantastic.,2
Niceeee! Haha love it,2
Wow, that is amazing! I hope the actual cover looks like this.,2
Dude this is fucking dope! I'd buy this despite having the game on steam.,2
would definitely be rated M, but yes this is amazing.,2
wow, that’s insanely good,2
I really love this box art, I could legitimately see this being official.. . Though I have a question what's that 'basic reading' disclaimer? Is it an American switch box art thing?,2
BIG Paper Mario vibes on the back. Makes sense! I could definitely see this being official,2
Masterpiece!. The talent in this community is overwhelming! 😍,2
OMGGG this is perfect!!!,2
I hope that omocat understands I would pay ludicrous amounts of money for a physical switch release. holy shit this art is good,2
this looks so nice dude good job,2
Beautiful,2
This is so fucking dope!,2
I thought that was real ):,2
Dude! I was super excited thinking the switch port came out only to see it has not. That means you did a fantastic job on emulated what this game brings! Well done!,2
this is super cool,2
He’s doing the funny San wink,2
I made a Reddit account just to praise this cool coverart, and ask you if you can remove your logo and make a PC version that we can use with front-ends like Launchbox.. . Even providing the clean front and back artworks without Nintendo's logo would be great.,2
Oh my god I LOVE the attention to detail, with all the warning labels and everything! The art placement on the back, and the box cover look incredible! If you told me this was official I would 110% believe it. 11/10!,2
I THOUGHT MADE IN JAPAN SAID MADE IN PAIN,2
If only this were it...,2
Honestly, this is the best fanmade cover I ever seen. . Edit: I kinda want to print this out and replace my Omori game cover,2
You're a talented one,1
Looks more like a thumbnail for a youtube video that's called something like "A little game with a HORRIFYINGLY PETRIFYING MINDBLOWING SECRET!!", so um, in short, unstylish and clichè, i would say... Do commend the effort and technical skill, and the idea too, this sure was fun to make! :],0
I actually thought this was a announcement post for a Nintendo switch release of the game at first glance. This is amazing!,1
This is awesome,1
U got me excited for a sec,1
OH. MY GOD YES,1
Why does this feel like it was made by Aluomorg?,1
omg i would absolutely!!!!! buy it, even tho i have the steam ver already.,1
probably close to the real one,1
Soon,1
maybe not with something (spider) and something (basil),1
Xbox next?,1
Looks so real,1
;),1
This looks fucking awesome well done,1
can't wait to play it on switch with my whole family,now they can understand how do i feel everyday!,1
OOOOOOOooooooooOoooooOooo that loooks super kool! I NEED IT,1
On point,1
i would buy this 1000%. . this looks amazing and i still haven't played the game,1
honestly it would probably be m cause ya know. . stuff,1
Dayum, this is some good stuff,1
This is ridiculously cool 😍,1
Pog,1
And then it became a reality.,1
what is old and false becomes new and true in time. So it did here.,1
Wow if only it was on switch,1
Almost time,1
Lih mao,1
Would be cool but too much spoilers i think.,1
Thank you!!  I really tried to emulate the feeling I got when playing the game,132
Maybe an M rating then?,117
omg i TOTALLY forgot about that!!  It was a hard time deciding whether I should put T or M but in the end I went "I guess a REALLY borderline T",80
[removed],10
Yeah, we can't have that!. ...,9
im omori and i fap and play old games,11
I agree with you!  I was thinking about it A LOT when making this, but in the end I went with the half-half one,78
It’s not that much of a spoiler imo. If it was my first time seeing it, I would’ve just assumed it’s a colored version of the mc in a horror part of the game.,14
Sir you see sunny half an hour in,43
How is that a spoiler when Sunny's existence has never been treated as such by the trailers and the promotional materials? Even the kickstarter campaign made it clear that you'd be alternating between dream world and real world.,1
Very well said man!  I put the psychological horror thing there just cause that tag just hits you different lmao.  But if it were the official thing, what you said could very well be the official one if it comes out!,6
interestingly enough, they dismissed gore, and bumped it up to strong language.,2
Thank you!! :D,5
E3's around the corner... TIME TO PRAY,10
TOMORROW MIGHT BE THE DAY >:D,1
I wish Omori was on Switch at all lol,5
Yeah i'd love to see the box art tbh,1
Aged like a fine wine,2
Thank you man!! :'),1
woke af ;),2
Hopefully we get the physical vers. as well!!!,3
Thank you man! :D,1
Most American releases of Nintendo games (especially dialogue-heavy ones like RPGs) have this on the back covers.,3
I felt the paper mario vibes when making it, but like you said it makes sense!,2
:') not sure if a masterpiece but thank you so much!,1
bro same, and thank you!! :D,1
itll be real soon ;)... hopefully,2
yo i didnt even realize that LOL,1
but ur not wrong tho LOL,1
You mean the actual cover?,1
M rating for sure, yeah.. . Because let's be real, the big reveal would *not* fit for a T-Rated game.,140
The T rating will still allow infrequent strong language according to the ESRB's website. Since that one line is the only example of intense swearing, the game would still fall under "Mild language," a perfectly normal thing you'll find in a T-rated game.,60
There should be inbetween T and M tbh, kinda like PEGI 16 instead of PEGI 12 or 18,14
i think it was already an M rating, and then the devs were like “welp better make the most of it” and added in that line,5
Subject matter alone gets it an M rating.,1
Thank you for the spoiler I guess...,1
Understandable, not like it’s real anyway so idk why this is cause for debate for people,9
Well yeah but ( I may be wrong) but it's never said that it's all a dream world in the start of the game so its something you figure out early but still kind of a spoiler,27
There’s a difference in what a “spoiler” is to people on r/omori and people who are picking up a new game.  To us, Sunny isn’t a spoiler.  To someone picking up a new game, this cover clearly indicates the protagonist is torn between two worlds, one of which seeming slightly more wacky and uncharacteristic than the other.. . Sure, you see Sunny in two hours or so, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an important plot device that should remain hidden until you find it in-game.,22
For real. Sunny's existence was never meant to be a big twist. He was right there even in the very first trailer of the game and we meet him within the first hour. If Sunny was introduced midgame and we switch to playing as him for the entire second half of the game, now that would have been a spoiler.,2
Omocat treats it like a spoiler so I think it's a bit of a tiny twist,1
Humphrey really is just too powerful.,1
*Oh Mewo, art in White Space.. grant us the Omori for Nintendo Switch, or the strength to pursue of nigh...*,7
IT HAPPENED I DONT MIND WAITING A COUPLE MOMTHS WHOOOOO,2
YO I HOPE SO!!,1
Scared me lmao I really thought it was omocat that just responded saying it’s tomorrow,1
Pretty sure console versions are already confirmed, hell I'm also pretty sure the original kickstarter had a 3DS version listed but is being replaced with a Switch version for obvious reasons,7
Makes sense. Some games that might have some dialog can  still definitely be enjoyed if you can't read yet,1
yes,1
That and the fact that the whole game's plot revolves around depression and self-hatred. . . And the fact that Humphrey sometimes straight-up drops an f-bomb.,95
That's just the premise of the game though. It's like how Luke Skywalker being a Force User isn't really treated as a spoiler by Star Wars fans because it was never meant to be a twist.,1
LETS GOOOOOOOO,1
That’s amazing, I know I’m weird (I don’t have a PC) but I’ve been wanting to play Omori myself!,1
"I FUCKING LOVE AIR CONDITIONING!". . The WTF Value is an absolute gem, and I love it so much, it just makes the game a lot funnier with unexpected F Bombs.. . ...Y'know, I'd love to see an OMORI Randomizer now.,104

Gamer/weeb moms with dad humour>>>>>>,14
Since it is implied that they're asian, it would be funny if their last name was "Chu" because Sunny's full name would be "Sunny Chu" which sounds a bit like... [you know]((character)). . edit: it works surprisingly well too since y'all like to headcanon Sunny as autistic,31

Lmao,10
Mario was first called Mario in 1982 when Donkey Kong Jr. came out. Sonic in 1991. Considering the game is implied to take place between the late 90s and early 2000s, the former is wrong while the latter is right,33

Someone pls make a edit of this,11
NO.,5
Makes sense, Aubrey and Shadow have the same mood and energy, both found tragedy on someone's death, being Mari and Maria, so... Aubrey IS Shadow lol,3
I was going by the 1996-2000 hypothesis, which is probably the most popular headcanon for when the game takes place. According to that hypothesis, Mari would be born in 1981 and Sunny in 1984. for Sunny to be named after Sonic he would have to be born at least in 1991, which means the game would have to take place around 2007, which coincidentally is when funny movie came out. Also coincidentally, the second most popular headcanon for when the game takes place is 2006.. . ,16
Bro you said the exact same thing and had that exact same chainsaw man reaction image when my Omori plushie showed up in that post I made about who would win if your figures were to fight each other. . ,6
If the game takes place in 1996, then yeah Mari being named after Mario wouldn't make sense, but 1997+ then it would,6
it was (sort of) confirmed that the game takes place sometime in the 2010/20s,1
Oh scrap, you’re that guy! I forgot about that post…. . . . (I’ll use a Nayuta one for this comment),7

Kel is in this so it's canon, Basil is femboy,17
[removed],23
on my first playthrough i thought basil was a girl so, i understand all of the meme on him,15
Undefined temperature take: Basil gets babied by OMORI's (and the fandom's) visual storytelling and it's part of the reason why some people hate him.,15
Sunny lookin at Aubrey toes,12
the biggest plot twist in omori is learning basil is a boy,4
,10
So true bestie,3
Who's gonna tell him?,3
Also looks like only one of them has discovered the wonderful invention known as ShOeS.,3

I know it’s a meme but it still makes me irrationally angry,2
I got flat feet my feets are always crossed (closed),2
What the fuck,2
We all thought he was a girl until the other characters started calling him by male pronouns,2
try not to post about basil for 1 sec in r/OMORI 100% fail percentage,2
Mari is more of the >!open neck !<type,2
also only Omori and Mari have shoes and everyone else is bare feet this is a referance to Sunnys uncontrolable foot fetish,2
**speaks in a new Yorker accent** HOLD IT! SOMETHING'S WRONG! BASIL IS A GIRL!? I thought he is boy!,2
One has got shoes and the other five don’t, I wonder what would it mean ,2
Yeah cool but no because basil is a boy not a girl and if you don’t believe me do some online and in game research.,2

With the was this comment section (and post) looks, ima just go out and say CALL PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANNA BE CALLED. Neither the game nor basil used the term "femboy" ONCE so it's safe to assume basil doesn't wanna be called that so don't. Also,neither the game nor basil called basil a girl, so it's safe to asuume HE DOESN'T WANNA BE CALLED THAT.,5
Also all the people that are dead inside or actually dead have colsed feets,2
Basil is boy.,2
open feet: likes women. closed feet: likes men,2
basil is a trans girl (canon),0

Basil is a boy, right?,1
Basil is a boy though ,1
: "Hello. My pronouns are he/him. Please respect them.". . Btw. misgendering a cis person is not better than misgendering a trans person. The Omori wiki states that Basil is male and uses the pronouns he/him.,1
Not to be rude but can someone tell me the twist of this game, a friend desperately tried to get me to play It and I knew there was a twist coming and it bothered me and I can't finish it. I know it's gonna be sad, but what the fuck was going on,1

Don’t worry guys, Basil’s only being considerate towards his friends. It’s the same reason he doesn’t fight in the game. He knows that his penis is absolutely massive and that he could instantly obliterate any enemy in his path, but as to not flex too hard on his dear friends Omori, Kel, and Hero, he instead pretends he has no penis or fighting prowess.,-2

Jokes on you, I walk with open feet so that I can skate!,2
Yeah, that is kinda tiring for me as well. I have original characters that are girls, but they don’t all stand with their feet closed (or open, for that matter).  I’m not good at drawing feet.. . One time I tried to stand like that, but I lost my balance and almost fell over. ,8
It probably depends on the person, i can stand like that with no problem.,3
I mean…most of the female characters I’ve seen drawn who don’t stand like this are often tomboys, and whatnot. If anything, all this seems like is a subtle indicator of femininity. One of them, atleast.,1
pretty sure that was implied from the start,2
Oh no, don't remind me of THAT comic ,8

Yess,6
the word femboy isn’t sexual, it literally just means “feminine boy.” I considered myself (not completely to the same extent as now) when I was 12. The Internet fucked up the term now it’s silly,125
Alrightey lemme just skip past this thread,24
12 year old girls can be tomboys. The opposite of tomboy is femboy. Ergo, it stands to reason that 12 year old boys can be femboys.. . Of course, transphobes see anything that violates cis-normativity as sexual degeneracy...,19
he's 16 in faraway isn't he, and he's still a femboy there,14
What's wrong with that?? Femboy means feminine boy... Why shouldn't a 12 y/o be allowed to use it? It's only sexual if you make it.... But it's really not by default.,1

Femboy is a heavily sexualized term and has sexual implications, now more than ever. . . But even besides that, he's 12. Mf hasn't even gone through puberty yet and ain't even feminine 💀,-49
🗿🤝🗿,14
Tomboy and femboy are used very differently. One is much more sexualized than the other. Look at tomboy on Google images compared to femboy and tell me they're similar, because they really aren't . . . Imagine calling someone a transphobe for disliking people sexualizing a child,-2
Exactly!! The way he dresses and has his hair and all basically didn't change lol,4
And still a minor. Doesn't make it any less weird. Also doesn't have any feminine characteristics anyways,-6
Because the word has very heavy sexual implications, and is almost exclusively used sexually.. A 12 year old shouldn't be labeled as such in the first place, sexual or not.. . . Not to mention Basil isn't even feminine lmao,1
But one term is far more sexualized than the other. Compare the results of tomboy with femboy on Google images. One is clearly far more sexualized,1

Femboy never meant anything sexual. . It's literally a feminine boy. . Fem(inine)boy,78
its sexualized in some areas but not all ( A reason why r/196 is silly cringe) me and most other people who consider themselves one really hate the sexualization and are just normal people. It was only sexualized by weirdos which I believe is best to try and push back on it. and I considered myself feminine when I was 12 (not to the same extent as now of course) and maybe my school was weird most other kids did as well. at least in semi-urban Eastern Ireland being a “Femboy” is a completely normalized and not sexualized term.. . Also sorry for bad grammar or things not sounding like i had to say it i’m ill and feel like i’m dying,26
True there's no indication of him being a femboy or having sexual interactions with anyone.. . This sub continues to amaze me with the "Basil cringe hate",7
Gross fetishist do not and cannot define a term real people rightly use for themselves,1
> doesn't have any feminine characteristics . . bruh moment . . you're looking at the same basil as us, right?,11
It's not used almost exclusively sexually... Have you ever even talked to femboys??? I'm one of them by the way... It's just some internet weirdos making the word sexual. It just means feminine boy. Basil isn't exclusive feminine, but that doesn't mean that no 12 y/o can call themselves femboy... It's. Not. Sexual. Unless. You. Make. It.,0

Thank you very much, Sunny.,2
Words change, it is a heavily sexualized term now more than ever. There's no point in denying it lmao. . But even then, calling a 12 year old a femboy is pretty weird. . (OMORI fans when you tell them calling a child a sexualized word is wrong ),-65
Words change their meaning, and this is one of those cases. It's a heavily sexualized word, but even if it wasn't it's still weird to call a 12 year old a femboy. Especially when said kid doesn't even appear feminine?,-4
Omori fans on their way to reinforce harmful stereotypes (only women can like flowers and gardening),12
He is kinda. Basil has a stereotypically feminine personality, Aubrey has a stereotypically masculine personality, it's mostly unrelated to their appearance,2
Unfortunately a majority of people use the word with sexual intentions in mind. Like I said, it may not have started that way but words change. It is overall a heavily sexualized word, and is now seen as that. Especially with how Google images portrays it.. . . With how it is now, people have to have responsibility with said word and not call minors by it (they really shouldn't be in the first place),-2
Where are the feminine characteristics bro, I don't see them,-4
It very much so is. The femboy subreddit is mostly suggestive or sexual content (despite being labeled as a non sexual sub?), most or all results on Google images are suggestive or sexual, etc. It's definitely mostly used in a sexual context, there's no point in denying it.,0
Sure, but for the most part it is a sexual term. That is almost exclusively how it is used, so people should have the responsibility to not use that word towards minors. Even if it was completely innocent, it would still be weird to call a child a femboy,1

I will deny it, because it's simply not true. . Maybe the word is sexualized, but that doesn't mean you can't use it without the sexual implications. . And Basil *is* a femboy. He acts like a femboy, dresses like a femboy and even talks like one. There is no way you haven't noticed that.,49
I have literally never heard femboy used in a sexual context.,26
Wait, you can't address your father? (Daddy is now a sexual term by your logic),6
1. “Femboy” has not completely changed it’s meaning, in a lot of spaces it is not sexualized at all in some places I could say it and everybody would sexualize and others would treat me normally, most places have treated me normally. . . 2. Basil is a fictional character and could not say wether they do or don’t call themselves feminine or not so their opinion is out of the question. . 3. No idea if this is an Ireland or just my school thing or not but femboy is a term used by a lot of the boys in my grade from then till now (Something to note is that me and the rest of them started going through puberty super duper early at like 10 for genetic reasons or something),16
In that case no one under 18 should wear joggers or skirts,0
I have you know I actually have a certain favour of flowers, I don't do gardening but I have my picks.. . If only Omori fans were a bit more open minded ,-3
I'm not saying he doesn't have it physically but the way I see it, it's just the fandom making him seem that way,1
They really don't. Trans fetishists and transphobes are often the same people. The same concept applies to femboys. I am not responsible for policing language to accommodate the people who make the dehumanizing pornography on your safe search off results.,1
you're literally writing this on a post that confused him for a girl.,12
That is, again, only if you make it that. There's a lot of femboys (like me, god damn it) who don't see it as anything sexual. It is often sexualised. But IT IS NOT BY DEFAULT. You're literally not making any sense. There's also suggestive stuff on nonbinary and trans subs. We're also sexualised A FUCKING LOT. That doesn't mean a 12 y/o can't be trans or that being trans is automatically something sexual. Despite it often being seen that way. Femboy can be something sexual, so can anything else. It doesn't have to be, and the definition of it definitely isn't. So don't make it something it's not, jeez Luise.,1
What should be used instead?,1

Then basil is not normal, the majority of boys dont like gardening and dont have long-ish hair :)),1
Ah, then you must be an expert on not being normal then,1
You on some hard-core copium then. Even the original comment I was replying to admitted it is becoming a sexualized term.. . . "an adolescent male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine". . . He's 12. Mf hasn't even been through puberty, he is not an adolescent. He is not a femboy. He doesn't act like one, nor dress like one or talk like one. Idk what dialogue you made up in your head, but it isn't canon.. . . If you can give some examples, go right ahead,-31
If you go on Google images most results have sexual implications . . . And do I even have to bring up the whole "femboy hooters" trend,-6
1. “Femboy” has not completely changed it’s meaning, in a lot of spaces it is not sexualized at all in some places I could say it and everybody would sexualize and others would treat me normally, most places have treated me normally. . . 2. Basil is a fictional character and could not say wether they do or don’t call themselves feminine or not so their opinion is out of the question. . 3. No idea if this is an Ireland or just my school thing or not but femboy is a term used by a lot of the boys in my grade from then till now (Something to note is that me and the rest of them started going through puberty super duper early at like 10 for genetic reasons or something). . and I also just want to say (at least in my opinion) is that the word “femboy” is not trying to say only women can like gardening and those things. but we are kind of mocking the people who do believe that by using the name they called us for years so THEY cant use it anymore,6
Sure, I don't doubt that. But like I said, it absolutely is *heavily* sexualized now. And I don't think it's going to stop going down that path anytime soon unfortunately, so you have to be especially careful when calling minors of all things femboys (something you probably shouldn't be doing in the first place),-3
Usually nowadays the term Femboy is a wa to insult others to tell them they're are outright sexualised. . I'm no expert I just decided to join in,-4
Where did you come up with that conclusion,1
I think you missed the joke of the entire post my guy. Refusing to answer the question doesn't help your case,1
But a majority of people do see it as sexual, that's just a fact. You tell someone about femboys, and they decide to Google it? Yeah, they're going to assume it's a sexual thing. I get to some people it may be completely innocent, and it may have started that way, but things change and this is one of those unfortunate cases. A distinction between the people who sexualize it and the people who keep it innocent should be made because of this.. . . It's sexualized by a majority of people, and that's the unfortunate truth. So it's people's responsibility to not call minors by said word because of the implications . . . LGBT subs are no where near as sexualized as the femboy sub is. I can tell you that right now. Of course people sexualize it, but it isn't the majority.,1
I think an easy fix would be to start using "feminine boy" instead of shortening it. Doesn't roll off the tongue as well, but better than the alternative.,1
Into your PMs I go...,1

Google the word "female nurse", "school girl" or "daddy" etc and 99% of the result will be sexualised. . We're on the internet, everything will get sexualised,1
I think basil is just kind and soft spoken and somehow people agree that those character traits can only be of a girl, which is stupid.,-9

1. Flower crown. This is the biggest reason.. 2. He’s the least combat-oriented character, and most of his specials are based around healing and flowers.. 3. He’s the shyest, least confrontational and most passive character, and is basically a damsel in distress for most of it.. 4. His gardening hobby and, to a lesser extent, photography.. . Obviously none of these traits are exclusive or essential to women or girls, but they do tend to be more commonly associated with women, girls, and female characters, and are more feminine than more opposite traits.. In conclusion, Basil is a feminine boy.,1
A majority of people see me being trans as something sexual. The majority is not always right. And if they're even remotely smart, they're gonna read the definition and know it's nothing sexual. It is, of course, not right to sexualise femboys. But it's also not right to not allow kids to call themselves a word that's not supposed to be sexual, just because grown up weirdos are trying to ruin it.,1
tbh i'm curious now too...,2
Uhh please sauce,1
ya,69
Enby does mean non-binary, yes.. I'm not great at explaining, I'm afraid. In fact, I can't explain anything for the life of me. So, unfortunately even if I could try and explain what non-binary means in simple terms. That probably would break my little cycle of not being able to explain stuff.. But a great way to think of non-binary as a person that is neither male nor female, just not really part of a binary gender? Idk. Like i said, I can’t explain anything.,3
That is an... interesting location,13
Hello The69FlyingDuck from the truman show,10
Hello router from the hit stabbing simulator, White Space,1
 no pls,2
Okay? 16 year olds are still children, idk what you're getting at. . . And not to mention, the image of him used here is from when he was 12.,-2
Okay? That doesn't suddenly justify it. Don't use sexualized language on a child, I shouldn't need to elaborate, and it's weird people are so upset about it,0
,1
Except those words are not exclusively used sexually. They are commonly sexualized in a roleplay sense, but everyday they are fine and completely innocent. A majority of people who use these words use them in a completely innocent context.,1
He has a stereotypically feminine personality which isnt deniable,3
Sad to see so many people denying it too when it's literally plain as day. Mfs will do anything just to call a child by a heavily sexualized term, then act offended when you tell them it's wrong 💀. . . Basil for real has no feminine traits, idk how people would see him like that in the first place. Sort of just enforces harmful stereotypes, especially when it comes to hobbies and like you said, personalities,4
Okay? If you're in your teens that's still not an excuse 💀,-3
I don't think people are outright "femboyed".. I see it as a way to describe yourself to a degree, I think it just as a petty insult of how people CAN act,0
Okay? Idk what that has to do with anything 💀,1
I get there are weirdos out there, and a lot of them too, but I'd say LGBT acceptance is pretty majorly accepted atm. I can't say for certain if transphobes are in the majority or minority, but I can say for certain most people see femboys as a sexual term.. . . The majority may not always be right, but when a majority of people portray femboys as something sexual? Then yes, it is turning into a sexual term. A distinction between people who keep it innocent and those who do not should be made,1

Thought I was done with this :'),1

Hello FOOD4U from hit game super smash bros,3
Hello Lattethecoffeaddict from the hit former planet, Pluto,1
\*does a minuscule amount of tomfoolery\*,2
"Daddy" is also a sexualized word nowadays, does that mean girls shouldn't use the word on their own fathers after reaching a certain age just because some people think it sounds dirty?,2
Femboy - a boy who is feminine. . I'm not sure where you got "adolescent male" definition fr but either way 12 years are boys (and also adolescent),0
>Except those words are not exclusively used sexually.. . Neither is femboy. . >but everyday they are fine and completely innocent. A majority of people who use these words use them in a completely innocent context.. . This is a troll because the cognitive dissonance is just too much here,2
And fuck stereotypes?,1
“It's a heavily sexualized word”. . I’m not gonna disagree that lots of people sexualise it, but we also sexualise other stuff all the time like bathing suits, short skirts, ect, that kids wear, and we do that because the *thing* isn’t inherently/objectively sexual, in the same way how femboys and people who call themselves it don’t do it out of a sexual reason, just because others sexualise it’s doesn’t mean it’s sexual for everyone else,0

Hello Therobster1235 from the hit dimension hell,4
Ow, my ears burn,1
No? Bro what, if you see a little girl calling her father daddy and your brain automatically thinks of it as something sexual, that's your issue.. . . . The difference is femboy is almost exclusively used in a sexual manner. "Daddy", is not.,0
Have you ever heard of Google. . . Crazy, I know,1
Femboy almost is exclusively used in a sexual context. Get off the copium dude. . . Blocked so I'll reply here:. . . I think that just says a lot about the term in general. Most people will tell you that it has sexual implications and is mostly used in a sexual context. The femboy subreddit is proof of this. Searching femboy on Google images is proof of this. Searching femboy on Twitter is proof of this. It is almost all suggestive or sexual results. Of course the average person is going to get the impression it's not a safe topic.,1
But a majority of people do not sexualize this clothing. You don't look at said clothes, and see it as sexual (if you do, that's your problem). They are intended to be sexual (unless the intent is there, through body language, combination of clothing, etc).. . . But a majority of people DO sexualize femboys to the point that it is a sexual topic. It has heavy sexual implications, and there is no point in denying it. The femboy subreddit and Google images are proof alone. Almost every post is sexual or suggestive.. . . When words like this become so heavily sexualized and have these implications, it's your responsibility to not associate it with children.,1
You asked for it,2
Stay innocent. I don't know what comic they mean, but.. it can't be any good, trust me,1

Hello Omori Plush from the hit song It's Amore,6
But someone calling a 12 year old femboy and your brain automatically thinking it's sexual (even after they've clarified it's not) isn't an issue?,2
You don't need google to know the definition of a "feminine boy". . Also Google doesn't show you a single search, especially for a slang word,1
The fact that most of the times youve seen the word "femboy" has been in a sexual context says a lot about you. Yikes.,2
Would you say the same with how sexualised lesbians are?,1
Can I get the link too?,1
Ja,30
Hello router from the hit water, bottle,3
We've been through this. It is a highly sexualized word, and is almost exclusively used in a sexual manner. Of course it's going to be interpreted that way (especially when he doesn't even LOOK like a femboy in the safe for work sense). Even the original commenter I replied to admitted it is a highly sexualized word,1
Urban dictionary gives the same thing but aight, keep coping homie,1
Wdym? Idk if you realize this but sexualities are not the same as kinks,1

Hello Jevil from the hit game deltarune,2
So is the word "daddy", it is a highly sexualised word and is almost exclusively used for sexual manners. . >he doesn't even LOOK like a femboy. . Litteraly half of the comments here are saying that they thought Basil was a girl at first. He looks feminine, i'm not sure why you're denying that,1
mi,28
Hello Mautos from the hit invention the internet,2
Except Daddy is not exclusively used as a sexual word. For the most part, it is completely innocent and is not mostly used as a sexualized word. Idk where you even got that from, but it is clearly not. Are you claiming all kids who call their fathers "Daddy" are saying it with sexual intentions? Because wtf. . . And no, he is not feminine. If you can point out his feminine characteristics physically speaking, go ahead,1

Do you live in a cave or are you just in denial. . >Are you claiming all kids who call their fathers "Daddy" are saying it with sexual intentions? Because wtf. . How can you not see the hypocrisy is what you're saying? Like seriously what even is this. . Are you claiming all kids who call themselves "femboys" are saying it with sexual intentions?

Hello Glaceonboy from the hit game Pokemon Gun Edition,2
Femboy absolutely almost is exclusively used in a sexual context. I won't deny some people see it as innocent, but for the most part that isn't the case. . >I've never seen anyone use "daddy" in a non-sexual context. . So when kids call their parents "daddy" or "mommy" you immediately think it's sexual??? Wtf is wrong with you. You know what, nvm. After this I'm not wasting my time with you. You're weird ah for thinking that way.. . . >Ig flower crowns are the peak of masculinity now.. . You heard it here men, you can't like gardening without being labeled as a feminine man. Didn't you know gardening is a hobby exclusive to women?,0

Ok here me out guys, the entire point of Omori is that embracing fantasy and leaving behind the real work only brings pain in the end. By choosing the fake Omor you are just as bad as Sunny. Accept change.. . Am I looking too deep into this? Probably.,0
Depends on which I can buy,1
Where do you find the official Omori plushies? The Omocat store only has Sprout Mole, Plantegg, and Mewo.,1

Aubrey might be my favorite character from the game. Always love to see the cool fan art of her!,20
The best fan art I’ve seen in general of omori. Great work,21
It's so weird to see Dream Aubrey in a different artstyle,16

I love this art style!,6
I like this art and them.. But I love RL Aubrey more,6
Woah, this is amazing!,3

DRIP AUBREY,28
Again I think an interesting AU is that the real world and headspace are merging,27
That's... kind of a problem, thanks to multiple reasons.. . Trying to say something about the image... well, RW Aubrey's in the Neighbor's Room, the photos are on the ground, and there's blood on the wall and on her face, which kind of implies that violence took place.. . It's seemingly the most popular image that the artist has made, which... well, is kind of unfortunate. I have no idea how it got so much attention here, to the point of breaking the average, expected karma number.,52
. . >!**…the Pink Inferno within this bastion? Something must have gone wrong, no one should have been able to speak, much less contact the Dreamer in this place… a quick expulsion of her from the Dreamer’s mind will not be the safest method in removing her, with Sunny still attached to her through these years, but maybe I can drag her as well to forgo reality?**!<,12
: yes, I'm high,21
Aubrey, eating life jam won't make you live longer!. . Even less chance if you didn't even eat it...,8
yknow Ive always liked the scenario where Aubby somehow makes it into Sunnys mind and spawns in the White Space and must reach Red Space in order to free Sunny from his mental trance via fucking beating the shit up of whatever stupid enough to stand between her and Sunny including all the bosses from all routes, the dream version of Sunnys friends, all the Something abominations and Omori itself across Headscape and Black Space 1 and 2 with DOOM music in the background ,9
When Aubrey searchs in google: "how to enter your crush's dreams",7
\*She is about to destroy Sunny's delirious fantasies and sent him back to reality\*,7
you'll never know,8
Aubrey might figure out Sunnys old crush for her,7
: You have 10 seconds. . : put me down,6

This would be fucked lorewise but this gives me an idea for some sort of spin-off roguelite game something in the same vein as Dead Cells. . . You play as real world Aubrey who has somehow entered Headspace and now fights her way through every location while trying to find Omori.. . She meets with the dream friends which can function as summons similar to Hades, probably finding new weapons, abilities, the usual roguelite stuff.,2
best aubrey art I ever see,2
I love this idea!!! I wonder what the friends would laugh at Sunny most about?,2
So... is this your art? Cuz i fucking love it,1

Does Sunny’s real friends going into his Headspace count? If so, Losing my mind and Peaceful Morning.,11
You should try writing it , have hope in yourself,9
If Sunny couldn't break free of the Headspace illusion the easy way, then Aubrey will free him the hard way.,32
I'm not sure how the latter is an issue,4

Look at him! He have a trophy on his head and he doesn't even care! What a cute little empty shell!,150
Omori deserved all the medals. . Don't ask me for what, just accept that,73
This is Sunny after coming to terms with his guilt, and his dream friends are happy for him even as they fade away,50
(battle results theme plays),19
Trophy omori and his friends. cutest thing ever.,16
A big cup for a big wine!,12
imagine theres a mod that makes omori has a trophy on his head,14
“WOOOO YEAAAAAH WOOOO BABY YEEEAHHHHHH!!!”,12
Congrats to OMORI and OMOCAT for this massive achievement! 🏅🎖🥇,10
This is so sad and happy at the same time. Why am I crying again?,6

OMG YES,4

The secret boss, only unlockable in Hikikomori where Sweetheart runs from the Slime Girls and works at Wendy’s,237
Sweetheart reached the real world disguised as Wendy, be careful.,185
I keep seeing McDonald's in other places too, what's going on?,22
Destroy it,18
SHE HAS TO BE A BOSS I DEMAND IT,5
Obnoxious looking Wendy,10
Wendheart. (god, what have i done.),3
Sweetheart Wendy: Ohohohoh! Are you approaching me Burger King?,2
Can’t believe that Wendyheart is getting modded in reverie,1
Wendy’s is better no cap,1
Perfect match, here,1
Why does this actually look canon for wendy's,1
,1
There’s no way she would willingly work for someone else. She’d also get fired the moment a customer asked her for something.,72
Damn you just reminded me of the fact that >!sweetheart fucking died after Humphrey ate her and the slime girls!<,31
"Remember, no Sweetheart.". . . 5 Sunny cosplayers attack the Wendy's headquarters with knives.,68
Be careful? This is the best day of my life!,6
Dunno, I wanted to post my 100% achievements on this subreddit but I was afraid it get lost in new. I saw this trend since last week and if at least it had something in common with the game like the pizza delivery.,10
Maybe she’d get slaved into it via contract,11
That didn't happen, play the Hikki route,9
AND pepperspray.,24
She gets slaved into sweeping,12
Oops I just assumed that’s what happened, I plan to play it again soon tho,6
I always guessed that happens since from the keeper of the castle it mentions how sweetheart finds a new home he can talk to him again, and that only works with hikki so something’s different happened,7
For context, that sub is for people to post random stuff while high on sleep medication,742
u/LimberLoveMuscle,165
hell yeah,137
The fact that these 2 will never >!share a bright,  joyful laughter together (like the way they do in this post)ever again!<, really fills me with sorrow and pity :(,125

There is fanfic about that and it's pretty wholesome.,14

YOU FOOL THIS CHAIN OF SUNNY’S SHALL BE STOPPED BY MY DECEASED FLAIR OF “😂 ANNOYING 😂 ORANGE 😂 JOE 😂 MAMA 😂“,15
do you have the name? or some of the tags? i could find it if you don't,6
And I said that’s disgusting, so I’m making a call out post on Omoriboy’s Tumblr comics, Sunny the SisterMurderer, you got a small brain it’s the size of this walnut but way smaller(like fr you could have just checked her pulse of if she was breathing etc) and here’s what my brain looks like. (Mari’s expand your mind sprite thing blows up),3

Daily dose of Sunburn. . Makes my heart melt,123
Hopefully this hasn't been posted yet, anyways [here's the source!](),84
Let's this be Canon,65
Cute!,35
Aubrey, I swear to god, if you don't kiss him back we've got a problem. He deserves it!,24
Omori: ***Yeeeesssss!***,23
They're so precious!,20
F U C K I N G Y E S,15
*Sunny tags Aubrey*,16
That's adorable ngl,10
I need more,7
Ah fuck my heart cant take this,7
This is the stuff I live for,,8
Fuck yeah,6
I created a fanfic where the two of them stay together, Aubrey whenever he is the tough guy but her heart goes out to Sunny.,6
Sunny's going to jail because aubrey didnt consent,7
now, hear me out, how about sunny going for a surprise stab,5
SUNNY tagged AUBREY,3
Kinda creepy...,-10
Cute but pretty OOC for Sunny.,1
Simply cute.,1
Aubrey uses SPIKED BAT! . . Sunny fainted and was sent to the hospital . . Aubrey gained guilt!,193
[removed],75
hehehe,46
If it makes your day, it was stated SUNNY had a crush on AUBREY as kids. Later on in the game little hints where given that both still are inlove with each other wich I hope is true because it would make me happy,64
Kel would not let a moment like this just go by... he took Basil's camera and took a quick photo. Since Kel was present, this is automatically canon.,34
If you believe it hard enough, its cannon,44
Sunny: shut up.,14
Link dude,1
'>!He has a STEAK KNIFE!!<',5
Not really. Aubrey seemed pretty interested.,10
Aubrey caught a SOMETHING!. . Give the SOMETHING a name?,133
.... . well, I guess Sunny’s first kiss.... . ...was also his last kiss. (Puts on sunglasses) ***YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH***,65
The ambulance arrived, they’re taking Sunny to the hospital.. . The report came in, somehow having his first kiss put him in a coma.,20
Yeah I hope its as true as you are a banana,31
Ah yes. . The power of Kale,9
You're right! I think I can see Kel in the backgroud!,37
This fanfic is imaginary.,2
Kel: “Isn’t that just a knife but extra?”. . Aubrey: “…yes?”. . ***Sunny, meanwhile, is dying of laughter in the background, having dropped the knife as a result of this***,1
it is fairly obvious aubrey still likes sunny after the 4 years,14
"SUNNY",82
Aumori ensues,7
He's the same color, it's just a little hard because of that.,1
Just like you were.,1
“SUNNY” used Wake-Up Slap!. . Sunny woke up!,63

Aubrey about to blast Bagel's eardrums.,190

I got the joke after 13 hours! New record! (It’s really funny though.),3
It took me a second,3
This is perfect,3
Never change, Kel.. lol. This is brilliant!,3
KEL is such a silly bean,3
Ofcourse it's canon, Kel is in it!,2
Pog,1
OMG this is so good😂,1
XD I completely forgot about that joke tbh, thank you XD Also good art.,1
Auby and Basil are so cute lmao,1
so cute :DD (rip basil X)),1
If there's Kel. It's canon,1
Yeah that'd probably happen,1
theres a cut on the inside of my mouth and it hurts so bad to smile...  but this is very funny thank you,1
Kel being Kel,1
Wait NightMargin like one of the devs on OneShot???,1
Suffer hearing damage most likely,308
NOOOOOO MY POOR BAGEL!! 😭😭😭😭,6

Yep,1
ITS OK,3
ON SHORT?!,6
Oh that’s definitely why Omocat picked that to be her birthday,6
>!he was pushed down the stairs!<. . Or . . >!he’s practicing the violin!<,5
March 4th my pretties,5
you have to march first before people tell you the joke,26
Her birthday is 03/01, but March First sounds like a command (first, you must march, then I will tell you).,15
Yeah what a goof ball,1
Thats tubad!. . . . Haha, get it?... okay im gonna go commit oyasumi now,188
>basil. . >suffering. . yeah, sounds about right,15
Little did I ever expect to see a Byzantine flag in this place.,10
413,1
I have missed my favorite character's birthday, I have sinned, I do not know if I will ever be worthy of forgiveness for what I have done.,4
This is the best reddit thread I have observed,14
Oyasumi Oh ya su mi, I know that its hard to dooooooooo,1
Byzantium had a basil. Omori has a basil. It’s logical really,10
Ah hello Basileus Basileus of the Basilea Rhomaion,6
Έχω κάνει μαθήματα Αρχαίας Ελληνικής, Κοινής και Νέας Ελληνικής.  Μου λείπει ο μεσαίωνας.,1
It’s my profile banner lol,3
Wrong comment?,1
how basil is with sunny when he was down?,450
DM: Okay and she rolls a... Nat 1. She is dead. . . Sunny: Fuck. Fuck. Shit man what do we do? . . Basil: Wait, I got an idea. We stage it like a suicide. No one knows it was us. . . Sunny: What about our prints? . . Basil: Do you have a better idea? . . Sunny: ...No. . . Basil: Okay, so we hang her corpse in the backyard. . . DM: *rubs face with their hands* Okay gimme a... performance check? . . Basil: Nat 20. . . DM: Literally no one knows it was you.,448
She really nailed that acrobatics check tho,206
This is why you put points into dex,139
Then she does a reverse backflip back on top to continue to lecture Sunny,122
welcome to colorful space. . you've clapping for Mari for as long as you can remember,78
I love their clapping,44
If Mari hurt her knee doing gymnastics training rather than softball,70
dude, *spoiler tag!!!!!!*,88
SPOILER TAG,62
And then her leg snaps in half because of her bad knee,55
Basil: I would like to >!admit what happened.!<. . DM: Roll a wisdom check.. . Basil: Nat 1.. . DM: You >!stage it as a sewer side. You have the prone effect until you admit it.!<,28
Maybe if she worked on her reflexes and gymnastic skills the ending would be different,22
Ok, now make a 40 hour long fangame about this route,11
Omori but Mari is too stylish to die.,9
WTF TAG THIS SPOILER,7
profit.,7
Dont we all wish...,6
>!Would’ve made for a better picture if you ask me...!<,6
then she breaks her fucking legs because of the strain on her already bad knee and she gets hospitalized and they're all traumatized anyway,6
Imagine the plot of omori but sunny pushed her to the side instead,7
This has a price, now Mari will have her bad knee even more damaged that she may have to use a walking stick for the rest of her life.,7
Mari ultra instinct. . Bottom text,4
Honestly had to make my peace with this game by telling myself that Mari is still alive and well and nothing happens, because it hurt too much.. . Now I have a visual of this headcanon so thank you.,5
sick tricks mari,3
Looks like mari passed the vibe check,3
Nat 20!,3
We need a crack fic about this,3
Artist?,3
Add Kell to make it canon please I swear to God,3
Three claps!,2
this needs to be an au,2
qte for mari to not die,2
This sounds so nice,2
Run cowards,2
yo she got sick moves tho,2
This needs to become an AU.,2
well, I am sure this one will become another one AU(Alternate Universe). Or Not...,2
P r o f i t,2
I just noticed that mari got a nat 20 in acrobatics. I guess in-game she got a nat 1,2
Imagine this can suddenly appear with a certain WTF value, you just suddenly relive the event but instead she does a back flip and turns into 'something' and slowly goes on the stairs...,2
i heard theres a very low chance to trigger this because you have to roll a 20 on acrobatics,1
The better ending dlc,1
Magic,457
Nat20 acrobatics does strange things,144
He was a Druid class and used Transport via Plants,66
Nat20 stealth check.,59
DM: Wis check!. . Sunny and Basil: nat 1. . Dm: have fun with trauma,264
Except Sunny’s parents…,32
I'm of a mind that SUNNY's parents actually know he did it, since there's a scene in black space with a man cutting down the tree, saying "you're not my son",9
if only they had the lucky feat,1
I’m glad I discovered this 2 years later cause this is some dnd shit that my players would do.,1
or she slips on the violin,8
Maybe it's just me ,butThat sounds a bit wrong,24
happy cake day,18
[deleted],8
I like the idea that Mari’s leg immediately snaps after making the perfect landing for a completely unrelated reason,48
Cripple mari au,36
My LEG!,6
A sewer Side? Did they flush her down the toilet,10
Dude, even through shes dead, her furnal would be disgusting in an sewer, how do you even get the body there without loseing it?,3
At least she isn't fuckn dead,8
well at least is better than being ded,6
Make one I will be waiting,4
>well, I am sure this one will become another one AU(Alternate Universe). Or Not.... . hey i agree that,3
i agreed this will become AU.,2
the best answer,114
Basil rolled a bat 20 on his deception check,40
Nat20 is a path to many abilities that some consider unnatural,6
I love this answer,12
Mari is the SOMETHING player,114
That’d be a saving throw but yes,13
They rolled nat 20 on Deduction.,28
When Sunny and Basil failed their Wisdom Save, the DC for the Insight Check was reduced significantly.,4
Actually there was a super good post a bit ago that very well defended why Sunny’s parents knowing is unlikely,  unnecessary for their actions and even damaging to the plot.,4
It isn’t just you,13
It is now,2
She slips on the broken violin pieces at the bottom,29
The bone rolled a Nat 1,20
Better than dead,5
omori Toilet au,12
you are right,3
and nat 1s can lead to terrible things,3
[removed],56
I'm gonna be a big nerd and say "Um, actually, deduction isn't a skill. That'd be insight".,15
If his parents don’t know then why didi his dad leave?,2
bone breaks and now you have slowness 2,5
Make it everyone make it now now,2
“Sure I guess”,21
Well it’s not like I’ve ever played DnD before. I’ve heard of it but it’s practically nonexistent in my country.,6
**Omori began their Insight work on Something.**,3
Because a child committing suicide in the family puts unimaginable pressure, pain, guilt and blame on the parents. They would both feel responsible and feel their partner is as well or hates them as well as a mass of other emotions. Suicide destroys families,20
needed milk,5
“Have fun.”. . “EHEM! SO UH, SESSION OVER, BECAUSE PLANS NEED TO BE MADE. SO UH BYE.”,11
It's a fun experience. I recommend it. If you can't find anyone to play with, you can do what I do and watch other people play it whilst staring longingly to the horizon. If you want recommendations on who to watch, I'd say Critical Role or World of Io.. . But I wasn't blaming you or anything, I'm just an impulsive nerd.,6
All you had to say was "Dice and paper",5
. . What if i,576
Once he is safely within your grasp it is your duty to crush him and acquire the item within. Mine had a cherry soda.,276
He already has brain damage, just look at his expression. . Not a single thought, only watermelons,225

I will crush his skull 🥰,53

. . This is how you actually handle a basil plush,49
Yumm watermelon ,24
Red hands demonstrate. . Every Basil plush is lovely. . How do you handle Etsy Basil? . . ,25
What is gamage?,17
Just hug him, with your hands, and put him on your lap. I've heard Bagels are very cuddly secretly, but hold back from externalizing their cuddle urge ,18
Could ya grab him by his body then? If I may be curious,11
. . Hold him like this,14
He already has brain gamage,12
. . If you hold him from the head he'll come out as Xboxlivesexual,58

THE ART IS SO CUTE I WANT THAT PLUSHIE SO BAD,9
Why do I want to kill basil plush in the most painful way possible,9
Alternatively, you can hold him like a small child,7

Aww, da Bagel plush is so adorable ,7
He never climbed on so I threw him away,5
blease treat him wit a love and a respetc ,6

I literally saw this same format at least 3 times yesterday on r/Deltarune and r/Undertale lmao,2
Look at my post history,2
If I boop its nose, will that give it a concussion?,2
I like how he is treated like a sentient object.. . Pretty adorable.. . *^(And... wow, this already is one of those "Top 500" posts, isn't it? Heh, just when i thought there was no chance of that happening any-time-soon.)*  . *^(Fitting for an especially good post/meme, but breaking 3k upvotes is a feat mixed with massive luck and ""quality"".

i just stab him with a knife until it holds onto it so i can carry it around,2

(he drank coffee),4
(kel gave him coffee),4
I think what he was trying say was that u should make a lot of points and justify Sunny's actions in order to say u love him but Kel is just a lovable piece of sunshine. Great meme nonetheless. :>,371
Kel still try to ask Sunny to hang out even after 4 years of Sunny isolating himself. He's the best bro anyone could ever ask.,670
Honestly the reason I like Sunny is just cus he’s relatable minus the >!murder your sister!< part,120
I actually simp for hero. And I'm probably 90% of the game's population. Or sweetheart.,81
DVHSOFHDDJ ION KNOW IF THIS IS A KEL SLANDER BUT BOI IT'S FUNNY😭✋,83
and what about it 😤,25
I like sunny because his cheeks seem soft and squishable,27
I just like sunny cuz he reminds me of me. . I like Kel because . 1. He is Kel. 2. He is the best. 3. He almost singlehandedly brought back the friend group. 4. He's a true bro. 5. All Kel memes are canon. 6. He is Kel . 8. Kel is related to Hero,24
He reeks of Chaotic Good, Neutral Good and Chaotic Neutral energy, his antics reminds me of Russian Badger, I love him for it.,39
NO. DONT YOU DARE. KEL IS A GREAT CHARACTER AND HE SINGLEHANDEDLY >!SAVED!< SUNNY . YALL JUST JEALOUS YOURE NOT AS TALL AND FAST AS HE IS,58
Me, who likes Capt. Spaceboy: haha music go brrrr,14
I am both,13
Kel is a great friend, a good person and also deeply fucked up inside, jesus christ these kids need help,12
sunny is like the shinji ikari of omori,12
ive literally written 3 pages on omori so far im jot even close to finishing,10
Yo what about shipping Kel x Sunny? Perfect plan, 100% best ship that we should all follow.,19
The thing is, its true,6
I mean ngl most people tend to say Kel is the best written character in the game along with Aubrey, so Basil fans would be more accurate lol,7
I'm both,4
i so badly want to know what sunny's side says,4
Sunny's my favorite because me and him have a lot in common. I get sad when he suffers as a result, because I see myself in his shoes even when I don't want to due to my heart needing a break. Seeing him happy is good for my physical and mental health.,4
Replace kel with Aubrey and that's the reason I like both of them... . . . . Kel is second best boi. . . Basil is 3rd.... . . Hero is 4th..,10
I too, am the one on the left.,4
im both :(,3
But theyre both cute,3
What is that enormous 1 page 4000 word-like essay you got there?,2
kel my beloved,2
I think its the same in the both characters, there's so many reasons to love Kel.,57
I love Kel because he really just reminds me of my little brother haha.,1
TOO TRUE!,1
Kel is a BRO, mvp of the real world,1
Ok but is that all random text or?,1
Kel supremacy,1
But he doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom so i can't really say much about him,1
Sunny is a very interesting character, Kel is da best,1
Yeah, that's what I was going for lol. . Kel's an adorable sunshine on his own, he's one of the most lovable characters in the game. You don't really have to say much about him for most people to understand where you're coming at.. . Explaining why you like Sunny on the other hand, is a bit tricky to most people.,209
I wouldn't bother to justify his actions, but sunny's still my favorite because I relate to him so much.,36
Why justify omori's actions when you could acknowledge him as a flawed and interesting/engaging character,17
He singlehandedly brought the friend group back together. Kel is the SHIT,434
Yeah I know right? I find his anxiety and escapism deeply relatable, minus that part you mentioned.,60
[removed],1
Hero for me please!,16
It was supposed to be a Sunny slander LMAO. . We'll justify being his simp even when he accidentally killed his sister and that he has weird fantasies about bullying rabbits,97
so, just chaotic good?,16
kel isn't in any "good, neutral, evil" alignment. he is simply Chaotic.,9
hes a fortnite streamer,38
The Cult of Kelsey has spoken.,5
Kel is deeply fucked up? Wdym?,3
yEs,2
For real. He's my favorite character for a lot of.deeper reasons than he's just funny comic relief man.,37
Yess, Kel is my best boi. I feel like his character gets overlooked the most and it saddens me cause there's more to him than a lot of people give credit for. He is adorable and does the funny tho which is always a plus.,5
Reasons to dislike Sunny: he's a mute. Reasons to like Sunny: why he's mute,58
Hope you didnt >! kill your sister !<,27
He's very good, but don't sleep on my boy Hero. He  believed in Aubrey after Kel gave up on her, and helped them make up. It's safe to say both bros are cool !,137
Yeah,9
PLEASE ION EVEN SIMP FOR HIM AND I'LL DEFEND HIM DOWN TO THE GRAVE  anyways Aubrey and mari make me go pan panic😌👆,18
Fuck them rabbits.,4
So, neutral?,9
every kel meme is canon,30
I don't think that guy has stopped to unpack any of his emotions in four years. Even when you talk to him  at Mari's grave he doesn't talk about himself at all and brushes off any concerns Sunny might have. He's trying to remain positive in the wake of Mari's death I think but it really worries me when he pretends everything is fine even when he has all right to freak out.. . Sorry for the late reply, I don't check my notifs often,15
Yeah, characters like Kel. Rarely get fleshed out. Its nice to see him realistically deall with the situation.,35
yes. . that's why we like him,23
Don't worry she's fine. : ),19
Why not both?. . Both are good,63
no problem, I just misunderstood and thought you meant he was "fucked up" as in he was a terrible person. This makes a lot more sense, lol.,4
Imo he deals with the situation better than everyone else. And then >!he's the one to reach out to sunny!< so he's just a good guy.,47
Oh jeez, I had know idea my comment could be interpreted that way. I'm glad we could clear up that misunderstanding lol,2
he feels bonita,782
Get a kel in that image and make it canon,384
no that’s just what MARIs ideal vision for HERO,444
Now hes the ultimate waifu,154
5 minutes means shes been wanting to do this and had that shi ready,150
She had the tiniest mewo studs,73
we would do that to be honest. i wouldn't put anything past him after seeing him in the pink apron.,28
Maid Hero is real now lol,49
aww lowkey sweet,22
I guess he's a true husbando now,18
I need to draw that,17
That's just story accurate Hero,14
Dawww🥹,11
Hero looking fabulous,9
Your mom has good taste.,10
Well, it really suits Hero, so you should leave him with your mom more often.,10
Beautiful,7

Hero is never beating the "mari's malewife" allegations,11

i actually think its kind of funny since theres so much official art of hero wearing only one earring..maybe it was meant to be!!!,40
Ah yes, Basil being the only one that’s doing it right.. . Sunny likely would too, if he could get out of the driveway.,627
Hero once again having the patience of a saint.,228
lmao the last one got me 🤣,183
I feel like past the nervousness of first driving a car, Sunny would learn pretty easily once he learns it's not as scary as he thinks,142
Basil: \*calm voice\* "Oh look, it's those kids that make fun of Sunny. Let's go say hi...". . Hero: "Basil, why would you- **WTF ARE YOU DOING!? GET OFF THE SIDEWALK!!!**". . Basil: \*still horrifyingly calm\* "Oh, am I on the sidewalk? Oopsie doopsie ☺️" \*floors it\*,287
why is hero so short lol,90
After getting over his fears, Sunny drives like he's in an action movie, drifting around corners and going at top speed,90
As someone who is terrified of cars, I feel that last one. With experience does not come security. The anxiety remains.,56
This is canon. . There's Kel so I can happily say that this is canon,50
I'm sunny and I'm driving around neighborhoods now,48
AU where Hero is the only short one everyone else is buff giants,36
Oh god, Sunny is such a mood...,32
Lol,31
Aubrey drives like my brother lol,19
Why is Sunny me?,13
I love this fandom,11
This. This is my favorite Omori post,10
sunny driving is just gonna be that one bob's burger scene,8
Sunny is me when first learning to drive and me today holding my license for seven years.,6
I relate far too much to sunny.,5
Yeah I was like Sunny.,6
It made me laugh so hard lmao 🤣,4
I've had my licence for 3 years now and I'm still Sunny,3
Sunny's favourite line while driving is:. . Life is meaningless,3
I was Sunny when I first started driving.,3
Are people with a single eye even allowed to drive? No depth perception on the road is dangerous.,3
Sunny is too accurate. Too afraid to leave house, too afraid to leave parking.,2
Sunny vs Amaxophobia,1
sunny,1
sunny is the type of whippersnapper to be afraid of any vehicle or form of transport ever. Even like a scooter or smth,1
Sunny is a huge mood. When my parents attempted to teach me how to drive, I hadn't even touched the wheel and was already panicking,1
What even is your pfp dude, I legit cannot understand,91
Sunny would probably drive like an old woman on the road,60
I feel like this is very much on brand for Basil,92
he doesn't need a driver's license, he's played gta,104
I'm taller than Hero is, but I imagine him roaring that would be fairly intimidating.,11
the boi likes to feel **extra** comfy in his car seat,94
And, by some miracle (most likely plot armor), he never as much as scratched the car.,9
I feel similar. I just calm myself  by thinking that I just need to follow the rules and be prepared for everyone to break them.,19
Really this is a good thing. Assuming you aren't on hard drugs, driving is the most dangerous thing you regularly do, by a longshot.,10
GET OFF YOUR PHONE WHAT THE HECK . EYES ON THE ROAD,42
Same here. Learning to drive was not fun for me.,2
Kirb e,83
"Alright, Sunny, what's the first thing you do?"  . "1924?"  . "No, silly, you start the car."  . (Panicking sounds)  . "Calm down, Sunny! It's just a car!",45
I've always loved the "innocent and naive facade hiding a complete psychopath that would kill for Sunny" energy that Basil has,126
no I meant im just in that stage of driving,20
Oooh,19
All that he needs is a rope and a target,76
I mean hey, he did know about suicide and people hanging themselves at the age of twelve. The thing is, this is the 90s and there was no internet so Basil wouldn't even be able to look things like that up. And I doubt Polly would let him watch things like that on the news, so how would Basil know things like hanging yourself or framing murder as suicide? I don't need sleep, I need answers!,24
That’s just a yandere.,11
I'm pretty sure it's more a case of general extreme instability than it is omori spesifically.,6
oh ok, GOOD LUCK YOU GOT THIS,24
Specifically it’s a photo I took a LONG time ago of Ice Kirby standing next to a frozen dummy in Kirby’s Return to Dreamland.,44
agent 47 better watch out,53
There was internet in the 90s. Hell the internet has technically been around since the mid 80s or even the 70s by some definitions, though science basil isn't part of the DIA (*we think*) the latter is kinda a moot point.,13
Yeah except instead of killing anyone else that’s interested in them, he kills anyone that so much as blinks in a negative way towards Sunny.,10
>a LONG time ago. . I can tell by the 5 pixels,28
Ok. Someone NEED to make a mod out of this.,20
Well, there was no DEVELOPED internet is what I should say, not by today or even the 2006 standards.,13
There were still search engines and websites and the like, especially during the later 90s.,7
Who plays this for 570 hours? I got all achievements in 150,684

you're a gross colour ,534

I didn't know that Omori write reviews on steam,148
So is that what she meant with, “No, YOU are gross color”?,114
I love the idea of them spending over 500 hours on the prologue.,53
Aubrey drawing a sky as a kid:yeh . . . . Kel: whoa watch out that’s sky the wrong color . . . . . And you know what happens next,92
Bro is tannedsist ,41
Kel is cool no matter what,31
I did not know Uncle Ruckus played Omori. He must have been devastated to see real world Kel. He will be even more devastated when he comes across real world Hero.,29

"Toriel being homophobic". Everyone: I pretend I did not see. "Aubrey saying that Kel was a weird color when she was only 12, lived in the 1990s and probably was only offended at that moment and always argues with Kel." Everyone: R A C I S T !!!!111!1,6

afk hours I guess?,290
I got like 50 on my first playthrough because the game kept running in the background lol,207
[removed],87
probably just left it running.. mine was like 300 by end because I kept leaving it on when I wasn't playing lmao,57
I got all in like 75 but now I have hundreds cause of mods lmao,27
i got 100% in 86 hours,22
500 were spent sobbing about Kel,22
I have around 150-ish for only half the achievements rn bc I keep leaving it running in the bg when I’m not playing. So that’s probably how.,7
Either replaying for fun or playing some mods, I guess,2
People who have no lives and play games for a living, aka pro gamers...,2
simp,1
I was trying to get my cousin to play omori. I beat it in a week. He took over 300 hours (I'm not even exaggerating) to get the good ending. He had ~250 hours in by Sweethearts castle,1
Sunny whitewashed himself. He purplepoured his friends.,576
In your heart, you know his right,. But in your guts, you know his nuts.,22
It's not a coicidence that all the somethings are antagonists ,21

This explains a lot though…,16
It is what it is,10
She probably didn't mean that. She was probably only talking back to Kel, remember she was only 12 at that point, if not younger. Or probably, her parents are racist and therefore she unconciously took after them and was still too young to realize what she was thinking was wrong 🤔,14
No it's not Kel! You're the wrong color! ,11
That sounds like Kansas except with a T.,12
Kel approves this comment,14
Also this comment is a joke aubrey is not racist,7

Thats month of gaming.. (source: i played for month cookie clicker and got around 1.5k hours also),44
My first playthrough was 270 hours because It kept track of the time when I turned the console off but didn't close the game,3
How many playthroughs of the game have you done?,40
i've always thought about using mods, but never got around to it because i don't know where to start or if it's even worth my time. what mods do you recommend if you don't mind answering?,11

I think you're looking too deeply into it, she responded like that when Kel said pink was a gross color lmao,8

I started getting into mods because I needed to undo the >!destruction of SWEETHEART’s castle!<, but upon looking through mods.one I pretty quickly realized there was a plethora of mods to play that all look amazing and may just never run out. So it is worth your time, in my opinion. Personally, I started with AMBIEN, which I would definitely recommend if you enjoyed black space at all, it might be a little tough to figure out but there’s a cheat sheet in the files (though you didn’t hear that from me)! Afterwards, I’d say do the miscellaneous bossfight mods such as BRASIL, the comedy mods such as the google translate mod, and the QOL mods for another playthrough of the base game, in no particular order. After that, I’m not sure. Maybe make your own?,8

Remove Deltarune and we'll talk,-2
gregtech on a chalkboard. nice,1
Omori,1
Nice,1
Ness, Ninten, and Lucas thinking why so many of their friends' game are inspired from the Mother series.,1
Are Earthbound and Mother 3 really "quirky indies" though? Nevertheless I still really like the art,1
Omori is staring at the stairs ,1
Is that Frisk sitting with the Earthboun MCs?,1
Can someone name these games? I'd appreciate if you hree in which ones are your favorites.,1
Ninten is fucking dead there and neither Ness or Lucas realize it,1
Yo, who’s with the earthbound/mother bois?,1
I'm yiiking out. . Also gregg rulz ok,1
Wheres my girl Charlotte Wiltshire?,1
who is the one sitting in the beanbag chair with the 3 mother mcs?,1
Anyone wanna list them out?,1
YOOOO THEY PLAYING BINDING OF ISAAC,1
This is what my dreams look like,1
WHERE IS CHARLOTTE WILTSHIRE GIVE MY BABY JUSTICE!!!,1
Frisk?,1
How the fuck did they get the lighting like that,1
NIKOOO,1
NITW UNDERTALE AND YUMEE NIKKI!!!!!!,1
Wait. Three of those characters don't belong. Lol.,1
I like how Earthbound is just allowed to chill here,1
Both Ninten and Ness? Finally someone rembers Ninten.,1
I love these indie crossovers AAAAA <33333 ,1
Ninten Is dead,1
Is that. YIIIK!? Lol,1
are they playing isaac,1
No ib..... :(,1
What game is brad and Mae playing?,1
The staies,1
Quirky Indie RPG I've played that contains protagonist with 'evil' doppelganger who they eventually come to terms with: Omori, Deltarune, Celeste, Undertale, EarthBound, and Oneshot.,1
Among,1
I'm surprised alex isn't stuck in a trash can or something,1
Fellow OFF enjoyer, based,1
Fucking amazing.. . Rip my girl Charlotte though :(,1
Lowkey dunno if I should watch Yume Nikki,1
Lisa: the Painful is such a good game! I wish I had other people to talk about it with lol. It's really funny but bleak and depressing.,1
LOVE THISSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!,1
ib, mary, & garry where?,1
Ah yes my favorite indie game characters, Ninten, Ness and Lucas from the indie devs Nintendo. . But where’s Celeste, the best indie game ever? Oh sorry I gotta go, my wife’s boyfriend said that it’s past my bedtime, see y’all later,1
Who's in the seat Infront of ness? Is it frisk?. . Also Lucas and Ness look traumatized,1
I love all the characters from amazing games, and then, right in the center, is fucking Alex Yiik.,1
sunny: hmm, maybe the stairs are better than a roof,1
Why is the mother series there? Arnt they made by nintendo?,1
it'd be cool to see Everhood in this group,1
Holy shit is that alex from the critically aclaimed post modern rpg YIIK,1
A good detail is that the game being played there is the Binding of Issac,1
[deleted],1
someone put charlotte wiltshire in this rn /lh,1
What about Little Nightmares?,1
Can someone tell me what all the games are? I only recognize Omori.,1
no everhood :(((,1
No red from everhood :(,1
The mother trilogy kids gets a special inspiration pass to this club,1
Holy shit, I'm Yiiking out hard right now,1
This is amazing.,1
Omori and Yiik in the same room? What is this a cross over episode?,1
outyiiked,1
Brad, Mae and Wayne there are playing The Binding of Isaac on the console,1
Why is he looking down the stairs?,1
This is so awesome,1
Aaaack Y2K it burrrnnnsss,1
amo,1
This room is filled with knives,bats and cats,1
I saw the Earthbound gang and said "Those aren't indies" then I looked at the blackboard and felt outplayed ,1
this looks awesome its basically my favorite games in a room,1
I need the name of every indie character in this room.,1
Inaccurate, the batter hasn't purified them all.,1
Why THE FUCK is alex here,1
Where is sALLY FACE,1
Is that alex YIIK???!?!?!?,1
Kris actually looks at Omori.,1
OMG HYLICS!!!!!!,1
I-is he? …that’s…\*lip smac\*. . **IS HE LOOKING DOWN THE FUCKING STAIRS?!**,1
whats that they're playing on the little computer there,1
I’m genuinely surprised that Omori and Kris aren’t just standing still staring at each other,1
isn't earthbound/mother triple A? it was made by nintendo   (btw cool art),1
Who let that garbage man in here?. . *tosses Alex YIIK out the window*,1
🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋🙋,213
E v e r y o n e…except Niko :3,48
Madotsuki does,21
Chara... If they're there.,4
Aww hell nah they turned Niko into a one shotus 😔😳🥹🥺🥺,63
IM YIIKING OUT,28
Surprised Alex isn’t yelling to omori about ded sister,9
Why they gotta YIIk on him?,95
“We almost just died ourselves!”,62
*Final Duet Disco Battle starts playing*,15
HOLY SHIT LMAOOOOOOOO,1
this line also works for >!Basil!<,1
No red from Everhood ,116
No six from little nightmares ,11
Oh, I've played it for the first time today, kinda coincidental,2
Just finished End Roll last week. >!surprised at how similar it is to Omori. The ending didn’t hit me quite as hard, but I think that’s because I was expecting it nearly the whole time. Unless there was a big twist like “surprise, they were all accidents and you’re blaming yourself and using fake evidence to convict yourself” it was probably going to end like that. Also a great rpg with actually decent battling, item use, currency amount etc…!<,1
>!he is staring at his sister!<,83
It's where all the missing quirky indies are,13
Do you really wanna know? Someone might get hurt...with the answer,2
call me alex because im about to yiik out,23
He doesn't have enough quirky catchphrases,60
Coming from a weird indie game with a deep and depressing theme with a banger soundtrack,2
not earthbound inspired (probably),2
“Honoured Guest: Earthbound”,122
It had support from Nintendo, but the primary writer /director was just a Japanese writer who happened to be friends with Iwata and wanted to try making a video game,7
I think it's Madotsuki,3
Alex would invite himself tbh.,45
Don’t say that, YIIK: A Postmodern RPG is the best game ever made. I laughed and cried, I recite Alex’s epic monologues every day (a hit with the ladies). YIIK changed my life, before I was a pale Reddit degenerate but now I’m the literal embodiment of Alex YIIK (he’s very handsome and cool and a hit with the ladies). So SHUT YOUR MOUTH before the YIIK maniacs take over the world and I send a hitman to your house to use the LP toss (Alex’s special powerful move from the game) and PWN you!,12
As someone who played yiik I can say: Yeah Alex is a little shitty but he's pretty okay,8
Wayne from Hylics (and a Hylics 2).  A surrealist rpg with sprites rendered in claymation.,29
Yume Nikki, Lisa, Off, Earthbound, Mother 3.,13
No mind to think, no voice to cry suffering.,25
I think when people describe "quirky" indies, they refer to story-driven RPGmaker-esque games inspired by Earthbound. So Hollow Knight isn't one of those kinds of games.,14
Not an RPG Maker game or even an Earthbound-inspired RPG.,6
Hollow knight is tiny, the size of your thumb. He's there you just cant see him,3
Alex: DUDE! Cool it with that...,2
Alex from YIIK,10
A game made by an independent studio and not a triple A company. Generally a game made by one person or a small team.,3
I didn't even notice that! ,2
He invited himself.,2
Yiik out,3
And so is sans,3
On the chalkboard it says the mother gang are guests.,3
You'd still only have one, look at the chalk board- it says they're honored guests.,1
No skrunklies, only YIIK,3
This is main characters only. Also Hollow Knight isn't an RPG.,2
Nah DDLC is in the Indie Horrror room,1
No it ain't. Try reading the chalk board.,1
It's not, it's an honored guest if you'll check the chalkboard.,1
Yeah but the chalk board says they're guests.,1
If you read the chalkboard you'll see.,1
Read the chalkboard.,1
Most of those games (not cuphead tho) are awful, and not in a fun way like Yiik.. . But yes, this is quirky earthbound inspired rpgs only.,-1
Those are in the horror Indie room,1
Is it because it's made in gamemaker? Because it's still an rpgmaker game in spirit.,0
Read the board,1
Yume Nikki (girl in the top left) . . one shot(cat character drawing on the board) . . YIIK (guy next to the on shot character) . . earthbound speaks for itself same with our monochrome fellow on the bottom left. . LISA: The painful (beard guy sitting in front of the tv). . Night in the woods (Cat character sitting in front of the tv). . Hylics (yellow crescent character sitting in-well you get the idea). . OFF (monochrome guy sitting next to the green and yellow character). . Deltarune (yellow and green human with the cap). . And then, out of sight, there’s frisk (undertale) sitting with the earthbound gang in the middle seat out of sight. . Favorites are omori (duh), deltarune and earthbound,4
That's Frisk.,2
They're guests.,1
Looks like Binding of Isaac!,2
This is the hidden prequel to YIIK and Omorty,1
[removed],54
And The Batter who has a bat,33
Niko has a molotov tho,12
I think that's Kris,14
IM IN YIIK ALEX, IM YIIKING,12
he was so they put him on among us drawing duty,1
Alex YIIK being based as always (Tbf in the scene just prior to that they did actually almost die themselves),40
No Buddy from Lisa: The Joyful ,80
little nightmares was an indie game?,7
no he is just looking at the deep sea prisoner stuff, which is probably more traumatising for him,4
“Do you like hurting people?”,43
*Do you know what time it is?*,23
*Has a menu theme in the second game where you don't really care for it up until you beat the game in which case you bawl into tears listening to it*,5
Arms outstretched. Arms outstretched. Arms outstretched.,1
I’m blind okay.,28
All of this just to make a typo....,5
Not to forget Hylics!,8
I also believe that's frisk's hair sitting with the Mother kids?,3
Off was so good...,1
They're playing The Binding of Isaac aswell,1
Born of God and Void.,5
Undertale and YIIK weren't RPG maker either.,2
understandable, didn't realize that the art was for rpg maker games.. . the white board said Quirky Indie games.. . so I thought that it was talking about Indie games, not rpg maker games,2
Cool,1
thats what i thought. i just didnt understand why ninten, ness, and lucas are there. ig because they inspired the other games,1
Can't argue with that logic,2
Oh yeaha,1
wouldnt omori be there too?,1
Oh right 😂,1
Idk man fnaf and bendy were cool at first but now they are sort of bad so I see why you say that. Fnaf will always be nostalgic to me tho.,1
Then omori should go there too,1
Because it sucks,-1
Appreciate the response! Thank you.,2
Ah. Okay. Thanks for the info.,1
I thought so!! I love that game,1
It's Omoring time! And >!**You should just die**!<,82
Doesn't Mae also have a bat, Gregory was carrying the knives,10
Ness,1
And Alex YIIK.,1
In the front? Sure. But the one sitting in a chair we only see the back of might be Chara from the hairstyle, >!or they might invisibly be there as a ghost of sorts!<,11
No knight from hollow knight ,74
Joyful is a dlc thats why there is only brad,6
it's jacketing time,14
Don’t worry, I didn’t see it either at first,16
Happens to the best of us lmao.,1
You are the Hollow Knight.,2
Read the board.,1
It's a indie with horror elements, like LISA and Yume Nikki, so nah I think it still belongs here,2
This subreddit makes me feel like an old person sometimes lol,2
Guess you're not a [Big Shot],2
???. . What a weird opinion, got any reasons for it?. . Also really funny to imagine someone who thinks Deltarune is bad media but Yiik can stay.,1
Nooooo problem :),2
,23
I think that’s frisk but frisk has a knife anyways,8
No Shovel Knight from Shovel Knight ,56
Joyful is still an important game though.,1
oh yeah im blind,1
ah ok then I see what you mean then I take back what I said,2
Yea and I'm only 15.,1
It entirely rides off of what Undertale was, but managed to be worse than Undertale in almost every aspect, the characters are way less charming, it's tries desperately to be as funny as Undertale was but falls flat on its face. It's also horribly paced imo. . Never played Yiik so I have no opinion,1
Frisk doesn't have a green shirt, and Chara has 2 yellow stripes rather than one.,1
No jump king from jump king ,44
Yeahhhhh I'm 24 lol,2
Weird, I have pretty much the opposite opinion. I think Undertale feels like just a precursor to what Deltarune is becoming- which makes sense given that Deltarune was the one Toby thought of first and Undertale was sort of made as a proof of concept for it.. . The characters in Deltarune are much more nuanced and complex, in particular I think that given there's a core cast of main characters that you aren't constantly shifting through (Susie, Ralsei, Kris and maybe Noelle) means those individual characters get more time to shine and can be more nuanced, where as in retrospect a lot of the characters in Undertale can feel a bit two note in comparison. Humor is of course subjective but I laughed way more at Deltarune's more laid back sense of humor, where as Undertale's bits often went on just a bit too long.. . Plus the combat and graphics are just like, objectively better. Having three party members makes for much more interesting tactical gameplay and environments are much prettier and more consistent overall.. . Most of all, while Undertale's message is... Nice, and the importance of being kind is a pretty timeless message, I'm way more interested in the meta elements of Deltarune's story- the themes of player vs protagonist and the amazing amount of Kris's real personality Toby is able to show just through other characters reactions and stories. And I think Spamton is more interesting than Sans don't @ me.,1
No Lisa from Lisa ,39
Nice,1
No bitches from bitchland ,52
isn't the old bald guy the brother from Lisa the Painful?,4
>!No sister?!<  \* Megamind face \*,18

How to immediately give Aubrey the manic emotion,568
~~I always knew Basil had an inner yandere~~,303
This has been a wonderful cinematographic experience,262
Bye bye, Kel, I'll miss you.,182
this is incredible,139
Then Kel suddenly wakes up, with every single fiber of his being telling him *not to leave the fucking house if he values his eyes ~~and manhood.~~*. . Meanwhile, Aubrey suddenly has an uncontrollable urge to march towards someone menacingly while [Cyberwildlife Park]() plays in the background.,132
Mom everyone started kissing. Please pick me up.... I'm scared,103
Rip Kel 2021.,101
lol I just noticed that Basil is sad and angry at the same time in the last pic,70
POV: Malewives getting kisses, a sudden war and a blushing cat,61
This is Canon,73
RIP Kel. . 2014-2021,36
the mari and hero at the end made me happy,35
Kel is fucken *DEAD*,31
Omori plays all sides so he can come out on top,31
Beautiful.,23
Cant believe Kel is dead. . I love this omg so cute,,,23
Me and the 2 other Suntan shippers:,19
The good ending is the one where they all kiss Omori because Sunny just wants love,15
Murder Basil was so cute.,15
Here's the actual twitter post ,14
Sunflower    . Sunburn        . and HeroMari.    .     . Together they make the **ULTIMATE POST**,14
Cute,11
Cant believe they managed to create a comic that caters to all major ships,13
how to be bi ~~by omori~~,22
Well, every kel meme IS canon sooo,10
Aubrey being a bean as usual, adorable. Seems this time she's being so bean-like even Omori can't resist her anymore.. . Oh, Kel, what's gonna happen this time?. . Oop. Kel, you dummy. So clumsy.. . Damn, even Basil's pissed. Leave it to Kel to find a way to make peaceful lil' Basil want to commit murder.. . And of course, Mari looking for Hero's love as usual.. . Adorable comic.. . Hmm, seeing Basil resort to violence makes me wish we could see Headspace Basil actually fight in the game.. . I mean, with how crazy he is about gardening, I could totally see him having some awesome ecokinesis abilities... although I can't really think of anything specific.. . I'm curious if anyone has any ideas for cool abilities he could have? Cause I do think it'd be awesome.,10
YELLOW TAPE AROUND HIS BODY,8
***MOE***,7
Amazing stylistically, this is exactly how I would imagine an Omori comic,7
THE TEARFUL ANGER BASIL IS GOING THROUGH, THE MANS INVENTED A WHOLE NEw EMOTION IN THE DREAM WORLD.,8
And so it begins 🏳️‍🌈,7
Lmao basi’s face in panel 3 is too fucking funny,5
Canon,3
It’s the Naruto and Sasuke kiss all over again,3
In my headcanon i like to imagine what happen in the omori world is a representation of what happened to sunny in the real world . . (Yes trying real hard to give sunny some love),3
Omori has 2 hands and shoulders Basil,4
The first panel gives me life.,3
Murders bunny with intent of murder,3

Triggered two groups of people.. . Basil's "unsane" status is kind of fitting.,1

And then furious,202

He flew too close to the Sun(ny),147

How to immediately cycle through all emotions rapidly,78
I'm sorry... But I have to continue this:. . . . Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),12
those subtitles are epic,190
I can't believe 90s Aubrey said that to Sunny!,98
this is amazing! i love this so much 🌟🌟,45
All according to keikaku.,43
this looks soooo pretty,28
YOOOOOOO,15
Why does this look as if it could fight in omoris time frame, what i mean by this is that it looks like the story was set in the late 1900s ext. 1994 - 1995,14
Those subtitles are so brutally honest damn,12
Okay, now imagine this. The Japanese dub is amazing, well written, and well voice acted. . . . . ...Then the English dub is like Ghost Stories,10
"I hope you can find some peace... or you know... some happiness.",6
This is art, well done!,6
Aubrey will always be beutiful, always,4
THAT LOOKS AWESOME,4
There's no need to pretend.,3
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9,3
Beautiful art.,3
YOOOOOOO 😳😳😳,3
Well! This is just impressive!,3
Aubrey but the design fits the timeframe OMORI takes place in,3
Aw dude that’s sick,3
wow, im in awe. especially since those animes were my childhood,3
You really nailed the aesthetic, amazing job on it!,3
“pathetic.”,3
deep,2
What’s she looking at?,2
Princess Bubblegum?,2
Aubrey spitting facts,2
i wanna stab her so bad,-10
Great subtitles,1
"Kel stop pissing yo pants",1
damn,what she said was really heartbreaking... 😔,1
Lol, thank you!,75
She has such a way with words 😌,57
Aw, thanks! :') That makes me really happy to hear,24
Keikaku means cake,30
Ah, thank you!! I honestly feel like I learned a lot about overlays and whatnot while playing with the colors so I'm glad it looks alright :),18
Let's goooooo :D,13
[This]() but with Aubrey and her rabbit,8
Thanks!,3
Here's the attention you ordered happy now lmao?,10
Dude wtf is wrong with you,8

SHE EXISTED,-6
Probably see you next fall,1
Bruh... Wtf,6
This dude hates everything, ignore him,3
Steps to becoming mari.. Step 1. Step 2. Step 4. Step 7 . Step 18,141
I love it,good job! It's so cute,38
The flying picnic mat with Mari,24
I see you Questionable jello,19
I love the food,8
Delightful!,5
Wings for Mari,5
I love the amount of detail in the props <3 I also really like the prop design. The colors in this art lovely, as are the highlights and shading. Simple, but really fits well together <3 great job!,5
I love this 😭😭,3
This is great! I really enjoy the colors!,3
Photoshop her out of that and into a dark-lit room and unto a bed and you'll get Hero's POV.,2
u/asuuree carrying the entire omori fanbase,1
Would smash 10/10,-19
I love your use of colors!!,1
incredible, man. i love the color scheme of the game so much,1
Mari, goddess of foods.,1
So you have an insta I could follow? I love the art,1
Ah yes, some lovely space tube food.,1
That picnic blanket was so small that she had to shove everything to one side,1
You have achieved comedy,42
Omfg I genuinely bursted out when I got it. Deserves more likes,6
genius,1
She dead bruh,17
Even though she would be around 19 if she were alive, her dream world incarnation is perpetually aged 15. Maybe don't smash,9
I love you both,1
[here!](),2
I meant smash her down the stairs you psycho!,-12
is there something i'm missing where were the ages confirmed,1
Thx,1
At the time of Mari's death / perpetual ages of the Headspace friends:. . • Omori: 12. . • Mari: 15. . • Aubrey: 12. . • Kel: 12. . • Hero: 15. . • Basil: 12. . Current day / ages of the Faraway friends:. . • Sunny: 16. . • Mari: (would be) 19. . • Aubrey: 16. . • Kel: 16. . • Hero: 19. . • Basil: 16. . There are various sources on this info, including Headspace Hero claiming he's 15 and Sunny / Basil turning 12 in the photo album (which takes place 4 years before the events of the game),7
oh thanks, guess i didn't pay enough attention lol,1
This animation is like something you'd find in-game. Amazing work!. . By the way, why is Mari so emotionless?,458
[removed],206
The >!ex!< partners are going to beat you,127
holy shit, I'm impressed you managed to figure the hair out. looks amazing,62
The dress reminds me of a violin,47
Their ultimate attack? >!Mari falling down the stairs and hero being depressed for a year!<,47
Mari with black nail polish tho 👀. . . G O T H   M A R I,35
So we have Omori in the original and Hiki in the swap version.. . Can't wait for "K" in another alternate universe,28
This is so amazing!! It's so cute. :D,16
>!Mari and hero  plain there way to Escaping the authorities  when they ask about the body they found in the backyard!<,16
Can't wait for someone to make this au playable.,25
Wholesome!,11
Holy shit!! My guy! Phenomenal job on this! It genuinely looks like an official Omori animation by OMOCAT themselves! If you tried to pass it off as real, I would believe it. Again, amazing job dude!!,9
I said That the Omori fan base was going to accidentally make an omori anime someday.. . Now the Omori fan base is going to make a Omori parallel universe game if you guys keep up this ridiculous level of quality,holy shit.,7
Standing here I realize my energy,6
Then they kiss,6
This is so beautiful ,5
Hero is so cute :3,6
this is so good?!?!??? sbkdhkfhdfs,3
Based, is tbis like a full fletched thing or only this gif specifically?,5
Damn, this looks spot on with the style! Great job!. . If I may ask, how did yo go about doing the fill scribbles for the hair and darker parts? What kinda brush did you use?,3
This looks so good! Just like the game,3
IT BEGINS. . AU'S DEVELOPMENT,3
Love the animation on this! Keep it up 👍,3
Plot twist: It's Omori with a wig and wearing girls clothing.,3
Finally goth gf,3
It’s beautiful!,2
Alright this is awesome. I love Hiki’s outfit and everything else. ,2
I dig it!,2
I'm REALLY late to this post but I just wanted to say I love the name Hiki. Since the name Omori comes from Hikikomori (Shut-in syndrome) it's just another part of the word used as the name. Brilliant.,2
I don't get why people don't say Hikkiko when referring to Omari AU, it just rolls off the tongue a bit better imo,2
idk why but i love omari's fingernails,1
Hero looks like the early stages of a white suburban dad or in simpler terms, George from young sheldon,1
i'm sorry but this mari just look like omori with a wig on,-1
This looks like something right out the game!,1
Wow, i love the animations of the omari au SO MUCHHHH, are you working/helping with the mod for this au team? i would like to know ,1
What the hell you predicted omori's and basil's release energy animation in the switch version,1
Awesome !,1
This implies that Aubrey and Hero’s release energy has possible romantic connotations. It makes sense, covering up a murder of a loved one to make someone you care about deeply not look suspicious is only done by people who you are either, extremely EXTREMELY close to, or someone you are in love with. (It’s usually the second one, if you are willing to keep it hidden for so long even if it’s destroying your mental health,) which makes sense, because it’s implied that Basil had feelings for Sunny.,1
In this au Mari=Omori,258
Thank you!   . Regarding the question - like a person said it's AU >!where Mari and Sunny's fates are swapped resulting in different turn of events (as divergence there is also Hero being the witness instead of Basil).!< So it's not Mari, but Hiki – Mari’s alter-ego that plays similar role as Omori for Sunny.,313
Glad you noticed. It's kinda hard to balance it out since violin has much more stand out elements unlike piano. For Omori it's just black top that refers to piano body and black and white striped shorts that refers to keys. So I decided to just make pleated clasp that look like strings and some minor details, but F-holes as dress element is no go for me since it makes it too obvious I think.,143
Huh. I didn't know OMORI outfit was supposed to be Mari's piano. . . The more you know.,7
Well in this AU they are partners... >!partners in crime at least!<.,131
Hehe... Not exactly... I still can't replicate Headspace color effects correctly, no matter how many tools I tried... But Thank you nonetheless.,38
Makes sense >!cuz OMORI character is based on the MARI's piano, so OMARI is based on SUNNY's violin !<>! !<,45
Ngl it's kinda like how Omori's shorts remind me of the piano,10
Heh… I wondered who would point it out. In my concept those black nails of Hiki exaggeratedly represent nail dirt from digging – like reminder of Mari’s sin. Hiki has this kind of an undertaker image in my head.,27
kelmori,6
Some people call her HIKIK, in case you didn't know where the missing K went,6
I primarily just used "Rough pencil" tool (in CSP) and drew it by hand. For hair f. e. I drew outline then used magic wand to make selection and then scribbled it out – it is kinda hard and tiring ngl, but in the end, it looks like this. Then I used "Running color spray" to make it look more grayish (in case of Hiki),5
,1
We have a word Hikikomori – when people remove “Omori” the only thing left is “Hikik” so usually they just move the last “k” thus making it “Hikki”. For me though this shouldn’t be just senseless letter play – it should be the word play.   . 引きこもり/Hikikomori means “pulling inward” – describing “shut-in” people, while 重り/Omori – means “weight” – >!this is symbolic considering Omori’s role in Sunny’s mentality – he is that “weight” on Sunny’s shoulders that “will not succumb” no matter what and will try to “protect” him by not letting him reach the truth. !<   . So, what we have left… 引き/Hiki – just like in Hikikomori it means “pull” – isn’t it fitting? >!“Hiki pulls through” no matter what – even if that requires to “pull” her brother to his death when his push made her lost her balance because of her bad knee, even if her up the pole beloved suggests a radical plan to keep her safe, even if she ends up “pulling away” from her friends – that is Hiki – distorted image of Mari’s perfectionism.!<,20
No, I'm not sadly. I was thinking about joining the project somehow, but in the end, I think I have too much of "in depth" idea with my version of Omari AU that it would be hard to even work with other people concept that I'm sure is more or less made-up. And also, I’m kind of a realist and tbh don’t have much faith in such big fan-projects looking back on other ones like a lot of Undertale fan-games and even “Hikki AU” one that have been discontinued. Even so I wish they will stay ambitious and will reach their goals – thus making me change my view.,2
Omari AU ?,41

Ah, I see. Very interesting, and thanks for the in-depth explanation.,51
oh! that's a depressing but interesting au,31
better than any undertale au,14

Same, but it makes sm sense considering omori was the name of the piano brand,3
How did I never think of that?! Now that you say it it's so obvious!,21
Yooo that's actually really cool! I love small details like that, that have a lot of thought behind it. Definitely part of the reason I love Omori so much :)),7
You tried dude you tried,1
Why did you reply to this a year later,2
Oh my God it all makes sense, thank you,6
Yes,15
Don’t act like it isn’t just underswap,6
People are making a game about it,8
Idk it was on my feed,1
I would say it's more like Inverted Fate. Underswap or even TS Underswap that keeps characters personalities is just swap for a fun of it mostly while Omari AU it’s more like “What IF” scenario – since the base of a plot is the outcome of just one fulminant moment – >!the push!<. Then there is a divergence with Hero being the one to witness it instead of Basil, but this is a small admission for the sake of plot. There could be a controversy about Hero and Mari actions – with them being much more mature and exemplary children unlike more of an outsider kids like Sunny and Basil, but at the same time Hero and Mari are those characters that haven’t been completely unveiled compared to Sunny and at least Basil and Aubrey. They have their “golden kids” problems that can be as crucial as outsider’s ones. Like Mari’s perfectionism, Hero’s bottling up and Imposter syndrome that comes when such people doesn’t meet their own expectations… So I would say this AU is a VERY VERY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT.,17

I've experienced some of the worst individuals firsthand who have the most heinous defenses for the ships they support (that come from mixing the piles). The worst example was how a sunny x mari shipper that I found wrote an ENTIRE ESSAY on how racemixing is worse than incest and he was completely serious.,2

Is this Basil x Mari, because if so, you better say /s fast.,7
Based ship indeed.,3
I mean, you're right; once you get into your 20s and beyond, a three year age gap doesn't mean all that much. I believe there are arguments to be made that it could be an unhealthy dynamic, seeing as Hero did act as an older-brother figure to the youngers of the group(and literally is Kel's older brother), but, y'know, not set in stone. it's a bit spicy imo, but not really,42
I mean maybe but then thiers a diffrent pile that has to separate the siblings and even then It would still be a bit weird but I guess it could work but only if thier like 20 or beyond,10

Yup, I saw a person try to write a hate essay on Pursuit once and then went behind their back to ship Hero x Sunny. Obviously, that’s nowhere near as bad as what you just described, but it’s still pretty bad.,2
Canon,1
Well, yeah, they were the same age when Mari died. Also, since Hero is 19 during the events of the game, and the rest of the gang is 16, shipping them with each other is a big red flag. If you have to start making excuses for why a ship is legal, then you’re already sending off some bad vibes right there.,1
What I’m saying is it’s fine to ship who you want, unless it crosses the age of consent or they’re related, because then it’s just creepy.,2

I think it’s Luminol, it’s a fluorescent molecule that glows when it’s mixed with something that oxidises it. Often used for blood detection in forensics, since the iron in blood helps catalyse the reaction that makes it glow! The iron in blood is effective enough that this can be used to detect trace amounts of blood!,28
I honestly don't know, lol. Looks awesome though.,4
I say this as an AO3 author unfortunately.,7
And is very common,33
Well, the whole point of Hands is that it’s very much *against* the Mari x Sunny ship. It handles the sensitive subject incredibly well in comparison to its more popular cousin, Opposite Day, which is just creepy for the sake of being creepy.,39

I'd say it's a pretty weak argument. I know that the average omori fan is younger than omori (the game not the character), but hero and mari were still kids by the time they stopped hanging out so I don't believe there was a power dynamic at play there and they were more or less equals in the group,2

If only people just respected common morals before shipping… like, yeah, it’s fictional, but the fact that you’re trying to create fiction for relationships you legally can’t have in real life is already a bit of a red flag.,2

Check by hits and kudos. While *Hands* is infinitely better than *Opposite Day* in terms of quality, in terms of hits and kudos on AO3, *Hands* is beaten by *Opposite Day* by almost double.. . . Though I’m glad *Hands* is generally talked about more than *Opposite Day* on this sub, as it deserves recognition for the single best handling of sexual abuse I’ve ever seen in any piece of media to date.,13
 don't lie to me OMORI/ sunny... You wanted to fuck the dog to,13
I like that name! It works well!,20
Yeah but they're 16 and 19 in game, which is a smaller difference frankly,1
What? It literally makes no sense. By that logic all the ships are creepy as hell because they're illegal in places without romeo and juliet laws or absolutely fine in places where there are. A three year difference when the younger party is 16 is not that big of a deal when the older isn't doing it to take advantage of the age disparity, which is something I don't think shippers imagine,8
A new smutty fanfiction idea that just popped into my head. >! Only thing I haven't figured out yet is who should walk in on Hero doing the deed at the end. Should it be Basil so that he's repeating his trauma of a friend doing something fucked to Mari, or should it be Kel to make it cannon? !<,0

Yeah, no. It still feels hella uncomfortable. If the age gap was there in the first place, we shouldn’t be making excuses of any kind. And if they’re both under 18, it’s fine as long as we don’t make them… you know.,2
Wait, I thought we were joking, what the hell,1
,2
I *don’t* consume said media. Also, yes, they *are* trying to glorify those things 90% of the time. It’s fine if illegal things like murder happen in fiction, as long as they aren’t treated like a good thing. The problem is, they treat the age gap like it outright doesn’t matter, which in reality, is not the truth. Ship it if you want, but we have *every* right to shame you for it.(Not to harass, though, that’s just cowardly),0
…yeah, I regret asking. But I still recommend you stay away from OmegaFallon’s works even if you ship Mari x Sunny, as they literally wrote their super long incest fic right after a super long fic >!where Mari sexually abused Sunny!<. Whether or not you agree with incest, you gotta admit that’s pretty fucked up.,1
Good to hear.,1
I have left comments on both oneshots. Batshit insane as always, Abyss.,1
I refresh new on OMORI AO3 at least 8 times a day. I’ve found a decent amount of fanfics in the past couple of days that have really piqued my interest. I’ll definitely check out your oneshots, though.,1
Yup, far better than Suncest and Sunny Side Up.,2
Yeah but but it's clear she didn't meant to push him too hard and felt extremely bad after.,1
Ah, I see.,1
it'd be awkward for sure but... i'm gonna be honest i don't really understand why marrying someone means their siblings are now your siblings. it kinda doesnt make sense,5
It would be in-laws, not step-siblings. They wouldn't have the same parents. Not related, not weird.,2

Oh, absolutely. But I think it's false advertising was the reason it has so many views and kudos. Of I could go back and remove the kudos I gave in the first few chapters, I absolutely would, but ao3 does not allow that.,3
: YEAH, WELL, ORANGE JOE TASTES LIKE SHIT!,4
I TAKE IT BACK WHAT ,17
What does "pro"ship mean? I know you're using it to refer to Hero x Sunny based on the replies, but why is there a pro attached to such ships?,8
,6
Because an adult being with a teen isn't legal.,3
Because those covers and memes are funny, and because Pursuit is a great story with all that angst. The idea for a fanfic you had earlier is just disgusting and beyond good taste.,1
,1
I respectfully disagree. We have every right to *disapprove* of what you ship, but no right to *harass* you for it.. . . Same here. Have a nice day. :),-2
You’re welcome! Also, stay away from HEROMARI. Everything she writes is shit that could make a fully devoted Christian question god’s existence.,2
I don’t know which ship you’re referring to, do I want to know?,1
What country is that? I looked at a chart on the Wikipedia page for the legality of incest (thank god for Incognito lmao) and it said nothing about in-laws at all, only half- and step-siblings.,1
You  put in bossman something and headspace hero and mari but where’s hero and henry,7
Kel with da glocko what will he do?,8
Oh, I see.,3
I don't remember they were just some random fics. All I remember was that one was a Suntan fic.,2
>!I fucking did. That ain’t okay on any grounds.!<,27
A bad time, mayhaps,4
>!He did. I gave him a really hard time about it.!<,16
ehh i’m not ashamed of it 🤷‍♂️,-12
What does that even mean?,1
What makes this worse is that they follow up that fic with a massive Mari/Sunny fic. She has gone off the deep end, and is beyond saving now. >!Watching her get owned in the comment section of the last part of Hands is still incredibly satisfying to look back on.!<,5
. NO IT DOESN'T IT TASTES LIKE MOCHA FRAPPE FROM MCDONALD'S WITH A HINT OF ORANGE,3
yeah sunset is the name for hero x sunny ship I think ,13
Proshipping is essentially the belief that problematic and taboo subjects should not be censored in media and that people should be able to enjoy whatever they want in fiction without being harassed over it.. . In other words, it’s when they abandon common moral grounds to try to justify a problematic ship.,12
1. Depends on where. . 2. Ah fuck it I'm not gonna discuss that, that's one piece of a priori knowledge that is positive,0
Lol  3 days ago.,1
I kinda don’t agree with you either respectfully,2
Nope you don’t also I was searching sunny x kel on twitter and found well uhh can I dm you,2
America (Louisiana to be specific). . To quote:  . "collateral relations related by blood, no matter when contracted,  . would not be permitted.  . Notably absent from the law is a prohibition when the parties  . are related only by marriage. For example, after the marriage to  . a blood or adopted relative has ended, former spouses of parents or  . grandparents can marry stepchildren or step-grandchildren. In  . other words, **former stepparents can marry their former**  . **stepchildren. Additionally, within the collateral line, former**  . **spouses can marry former in-laws** within what could be considered  . prohibited degrees of kinship, such as former sisters- and brothersin-law, aunts and uncles, and first cousins related only by  . marriage."

Sure, go ahead. I’ve probably seen worse from my time in r/cursedomori.. . . Edit: I take it back. Who the fuck actually sat down, drew that abomination, and thought it was okay to post online?,1
That's about direct relationships. Hero could marry Sunny after divorcing Mari is what that says, or Kel marry Mari after divorcing Sunny. Former spouses can marry their former in-laws after they've divorced their current spouse. Nothing about in-laws being unable to marry each other.,3
For perspective, imagine someone looks at R34 of fictional children. Sure, it’s just drawings, and sure, it’s just fictional characters. But the fact that someone gets off to that is concerning in its own right, especially if they don’t stop at fictional children.,3

That he experienced the same thing. That didn’t make it right, however, and I let him know that.,8
i will lol,-1
Oh, okay. It’s…kinda a dead dove? I think it’s more accurate to call it a secondary ship. Sunburn is my main one, followed by HeroMari.,1
  YOUR JUST JEALOUS THAT I HAVE A DOG TO FUCK AND YOU DONT,4
It is called that.,2
Yeah, I can see that. Harassing them is just cowardly. That being said, I don’t support it, and anyone who tries to convince me to do so is not gonna get far.,4
Lol. . ,1

Okay, so let me get this straight before I assume things. You support Aubrey as a 16 year old dating Hero as a 19 year old, right?,1

Yup.,2
Lolz. . ,1
Okay, so it's a platonic ship?,2
: SHUT THE FUCK UP OR I’M GETTING THE LUBE, BASIL!,3
laughter. . ,1
More than friends, less than lovers. If that makes sense. I imagine Kel would make a joke about them dating only to get punched in the gut by Aubrey.,2
  bro what the fuck have you been doing to basil,4
Haha. . ,1
...that's a pretty creepy joke to make,1
: Sunny, I thought you swore to keep us a secre—. . : We’re dealing with a zoophile, all bets are off.,3
That’s why Aubrey punched him,1
. DONT DRAG BASIL INTO THIS ALL HE DID WAS WALK IN THE ROOM AT THE WRONG TIME,4
...that's a trope of a romantic subplot...you do know that, right?,1
: AT LEAST I’M NOT THE ONE HAVING SEX WITH THEIR OWN DOG!,3
It is? I only thought of it as a Kel Moment.,2
  kel what is he talking about. .  ITS NOT IMPORTANT BASIL. SUNNY HECTOR FUCKING LOVED IT,4
...yes? It's a really common trope of a romantic plot. I've only seen it once where it wasn't, and that was where it was showing creepy people,2
: OH REALLY? YOU WOULDN’T MIND IF I TOLD HERO, THEN, WOULD YOU?,3
Oh. I didn’t know that.. . Damn it Kel XD,2
  NO DONT TELL HERO HE WILL TELL MY MOM,3
: Well, then, stop using Hector as a FUCKING FLESHLIGHT and *MAYBE* I’ll let you go!,3
  hey sunny I escaped the headspace and I need to find hero... I'm gonna fuck him. .  WHO THE HELL IS THAT,5
 You know what, fuck this shit.. . 🔫 Goodbye.. . 💥🔫,3
. BASIL NOOOOO. .  I WAS IN THE CLOSET THE WHOLE TIME WHAT IS HAPPENING,3
AUBREY, BASIL KILLED HIMSELF, KEL FUCKS HIS OWN DOG, AND SWEETHEART IS TRYING TO HAVE SEX WITH HERO!,3
  IM GOING WITH SWEET HEART. .  THREESOME. .  ALL I DID WAS FUCK MY DOG,5

I love this. Also ngl, this game made me wish I had a sibling like Mari because I loved her as a character and felt so bad for Sunny with what happend to her.,6

Twitter users don't sexualize 15 year old girls >!(and no, just because she'd be 19 if she was alive does not count)!< for a minute challenge. Seriously why are you getting downvoted for not liking "**Very good looking** Big Sis" this sub creeps me out sometimes,9
Tbf by making her look mature in this manner he’d actually be doing away with pedos. Sexualizing headspace aubrey and those characters would be different but pedos like kids not adults that are canonically kids,5
Also I don't get why you're being downvoted,4

Ok, I was looking through my post history and came across this whole fiasco again.. . &#x200B;. . Dude, there is no way you can "bad English" your way out of this.,6
Have a look at the rest of this comment section and "Very good looking Big Sis". Why am I getting downvoted for not wanting people to get rock hard for a fucking 15 year old,1
"Very good looking",14
There is more. . . . There is much more.,4
EXACTLY THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST,8
But she doesn't look 15 here? Aging up characters is still bad?,1
they upset the pedos lol,1

You're getting downvoted because you're overreacting over someone who's english isn't their first language trying to compliment a character they find cute or beautiful. . Aren't YOU the one making all of this sexual by implying it in the first place??,12

That make Omori success because it help create a fandom,5
That’s because she beautiful but I wrote the title differently just make it a bit attractive you know.,7
Wat ? :v,9
Ah, makes sense, however, there ARE people who defend fictional children and real life children, like, look up cuties on YouTube, you will see more hate then support,10
Can… can you **actually** stop with harassing this individual in every comment they make? They like a fictional character, and you find it creepy. Congratulations 😁 Now, ignore it the next time you see it if you are still a part of the subreddit (:,2
I mean my “bad English” is like how I don’t understand the true meaning of my title those,sorry for the title seem less innocent.,1

The OP doesn't have english as their first language so I'd cut them some slack on the modern inneuendo on calling someone "Very good looking",3
yeah that is wierd actually, idk why youre getting downvoted. . . . EDIT:aaaaand got downvoted, seriously this is just wierd,12
Like Omori R34. . Theres literally 300 or something of it and it makes me wanna cry,5
I'm getting downvoted too. Getting downvoted for telling reddit users not to sexualize minors gang,3
Yeah if it was just "beautiful Mari" or something that'd be fine,-1
Smh, when will people learn that pedos have feelings too??? /s,-2
**Pls I Repeat that I just write the title a bit different so pls don’t let you mind get weird**,1
I wasn't referring to the post, that if the op keeps acting, or even phrasing stuff  like this, it could end bad,1
you just said it yourself, they find her cute or beautiful, she is 15. . . That should speak for itself.,1
Sorry, I was pissed off, i'll fex that.,1
nah, I would say the joke was good tbh, there was no need to delete it, sorry if I sent the wrong message,1

Don't mind people like that, Twitter cancel cucks got bored of nothing happening on twitter right now and are going to fandoms they like to see if they can try to label randos as pedos,15
But from what I know, not all lolicons/shotacons are going on their way to abuse children, just like not all CS:GO players are going on their way to commit terrorism.. . &#x200B;. . I can safely say this because I have a friend on discord which was attracted to lolicon but would never think about doing anything wrong with a actual child, and because I played a lot of Halo and some Mortal Combat II when I was a kid but I would never think about actually glory killing that one annoying kid at the restaurant. . . &#x200B;. . Off course there are bad apples on lolicon/shotacon, there is always bad apples on any group of people, but intentionally cherry picking Lolicon/Shotacon fandoms because of that one guy who did this atrocity is not a fair way to judge an entire group of people, btw, keeping these types of thoughts and acts in the realm of fiction is better than practicing them in real life, right?,4
yeah, it's creepy, cuz shes a kid, i don't ee your problem here, you,1
You didn't mention the fact that you supplied a punchline to a joke about a 15 year olds butt... ni,1
Alright then   . . It's just that seeing as this is Reddit I'm used to looking at any post of a pretty woman being filled with thirst from OP and the comment section both, so I'm pretty on edge,0
go to convertisal posts of all time in this subreddit youll see this guy,12

Hey i just wanna see some weird joke or nice comment but I’m not expected to be call a pedo just for the title.. . Why I just the phrase of Word for a bit and then someone make a conclusion that I’m a pedo like for real ?,7
Damn. . I didn't know calling a baby cute was trying to sexualise or romanticise the baby. . Same goes for children/teen, a compliment doesn't equal to sexualisation/flirting. . Get a grip, if what you said made sense there would be alot of people going to jail for calling young people cute. . Edit: Didn't you say you were leaving btw?,4

I loathe twitter with every single fucking cell in my body, people that think "cancelling" has a place in 2021 are out of their mind. It's just insanely creepy when people start calling a 15 year old hot. It's pretty alarming when I'm getting downvoted for wanting people not to sexualize minors, which is like basic human fuckin' decency??,-2
Exactly what I thought.,1
r/ihadastroke,1
Well I won’t make that title again,just try to be creative.,1
Honestly if theres more I don't even doubt it, people are weird,4
The Words "Good looking" and further "Very good looking" are often associated with "catcalling" or being flirty. . . and as you know trying to flirt with a 15 year old is a big nono in a lot of people's minds. . I know this wasn't your intention but I wanted to explain it,6
[deleted],3
Very good looking and beautiful essentially mean the same thing, but with a slightly different feel. I know you didn't mean for it in a bad way though.,2
Dude, the guy said "Verry "Good-loking" Shes 15. Its not the photo, the title.,3
your still calling a kid.. :very.. good looking." That's not.. cute.,1
oh, alright, btw don't let other people control what you post on the internet (unless if it's something illegal or deeply imoral), you might get downvoted to hell but you still got your rights to speak,3
OP didn't call Mari "hot", just "good looking" and EVEN THEN their english is butched due to it not being their first language, they were just looking to say that they think a character looks good/cute to them and you can see it everywhere in the comment section. . You're the one closer to sexualising minors more than anything for your first thought being "that guy is sexualising a minor" before trying to get anything straight, for someone that thinks "canceling" doesn't have a place in our time, you certainly HAVE the mindset,9
So, you can't see the difference between reality and fiction.. . Or you actually see the point I was trying to make.,3
True. And creepy,2
Ok thanks for the explaining,1
It literally calls her "very good looking" in the post title and the comments section is full of thirst. This argument is requires you have to not read *a lot* in order to think this.,0
I just try to be creative with my title those,but I don’t expected to get overreact with that then call me a pedo for real.I’m sorry for that title.. . But I wonder Mari had flirted with Hero this line:”What cooking,good looking.” Then why “very good looking” make you guy feel weird or aware of the title ?,6
I feel weird when you just upset the title,Honestly. I understand you don’t want to see some creep,but the creep is only there own ideal just want to do some bad thing of there mind those.. . But I’m not them,people see the title pretty normal but you feel aware of the title.,2
Read the title,1
Ok if it isn't their first language I'll cut them some slack. [But are you willfully ignoring this??]() And [this]()? This comment section is creepy as hell with shit like [this](), too!,-2
I do see the point of what I’m trying to make, I’m just not good at expressing it,1
If you look at your example, good looking is often used in a more flirty way. I think that is why it feels different than "beautiful". . . I'm sorry people think you're a pedo for real, that's some crazy shit,1
And as many said before: It's clearly not the intention to sexualise her. . It's still a compliment. It's odd, i agree but OP is not an english speaker so they didn't know that sounded wrong. . Again i'll ask:. . "Aren't YOU the one making all of this sexual by implying it in the first place??". . Go back accusing everyone to be pedos on twitter, this is reddit,3
Again, what OP said sounds weird but i don't see any ill intent. . And the other 2 are totaly creepy, they 100% seem to be speaking english and especialy the second guy. . I'm not ignoring anything, you just need to stop applying cancel culture to your life if you hate it so much. . Edit: Especialy since the guy claims to be 17 so sheesh what a young "pedo",11
Ok then, how about this, you are allowed to dislike a kink, but you aren't allowed to police other people's kinks, that's the police job.,3
No joke,just because the title be difference and then some guy just poll a pedo card on me and I be like:”Yo what,did my title just make you think of me like a pedo for real ?”,3
Well if it mean like that then you can try to imagine Hero say that just to make the titile functional those.. . I just try to make some difference with Beautiful Mari title. (cause I see it pretty boring),4
Look, Reddit doesn't exactly have the bar set very high so my expectations are kind of in the fucking mantle every single time someone posts a woman and comments on her appearance. All in all, I don't think there's any ill intent from OP, he's just being a little weird,4
Fair,1
I don't think that you're a pedo, it's just a weird thing to say.,3
What if they simply said “they look cute”?,10
All in all i think you need to chill because your reaction is a twitter reaction because if you'd have waited a lil you'd have realised there was no ill intent from the very begining. . Attacking people out of the blue is not a very good thing to do,9
That'd be different,6
Yeah that makes sense. Sorry man, it's just that a lot of other comment sections and posts on this sub get really thirsty so everything feels like some weird fuckin' pedo thing,7
I say it's better to ignore it, man. . People will be weirdos and calling them out on it won't do much. . Best you can do is downvote and be glad that atleast they're not creeping on real children,10

I saved in the elevator and then for the next 20 minutes i gambled, i got 200k clams and saved there, i was the best gambler of all time,2

When the minecract stans got mad at omori I had just started playing so I tried to avoid it, can someone tell me what the drama was?,21
and then basil is GeorgeNotFound and that's when the psychological horror part of the game REALLY comes out.,6
He's going to speedrun a spoiler thing and get away with it,16
Is there a context I’m missing? I know he’s dream and an mcyt but what happened?,4
This actually scared the shit out of me,4
He is getting hunted down,2
that's what the point of escapism is,2
You are afraid of whimpering audios (aren't we all?),1

MCYT? You mean Minecraftubers,8
(he is just very lucky tho!😳),12
That is a scarily accurate imitation of a Dream stan,82
A Minecraft YouTuber wanted to play the game, and people on Twitter started to refer to it as “able-ist” to stop him from playing it (when in reality omori is not about any physical/mental condition whatsoever), so omori fans fought back on Twitter and also kind of tried to gatekeep the game from mcyt, and a bunch of controversy regarding omocat was also brought up. Just badly dealt with by both sides of the drama,37
[removed],16
I understand wanting to come here early, but I would recommend leaving the sub until you finish the game so you don’t accidentally get anything else spoiled. It’s so good and I don’t want you to ruin any of it for yourself.,178
Omori is one of those games where you have to stop yourself from browsing ANY kind of content from it until you finished the game.  I had to literally stop using the internet for a while because completely unrelated communities were posting spoilers on the game.,28
It hurts pal.,1
They already hate OMORI what more can you do,56
BEAR WHAT BEAR WHAT BUSH,68
he didnt mean it his cat ran over his key oard!!!,5
Who the hell downvote this?,7
good ending :),42
Yeah that’s what they meant,27
Yes, that’s what MCYT means.,8
i hope it is an imitation bc it looks legit,11
this was a joke comment btw on really serious i thought the spamm letter gave you the idea,5
Isn't Omori about disassociative amnesia and depression though? Also yeah honestly fuck this community for harassing Ranboo into not playing it, I was genuinely looking forward to that after finishing the game myself,27
He isn’t gonna be forgiven and I kinda feel bad. There’s two extremes, stans and antis but I feel like nobody ever calls out antis for doing the same thing stans do because they hate on popular thing because popular thing = bad. I just want everyone in that community to fucking be happy and drop their worries, Stan or just average viewer.,6
The one around the bush. Was I not clear?,29
The jelly bear :D,11
No idea. But it's their opinion, i'll just try better next time hehe,12
He has technoblade in his name and pfp sooo i think it's legit,3
The interpretation of the game is free to the player, which is why it’s dumb to think that the game ever specifically characterizes or explicitly states that sunny is someone with DID since omori as his coping mechanism could just be a gigantic metaphor. I do think the community was wrong for gatekeeping, but to be fair it’s the Twitter part of the community and Twitter is a toxic wasteland. Mcyt handled the situation just as badly, however.,26
no no im just kidding,9
oh shit what are we gonna do now,3
oh shit what are we gonna do now,2
Yeah that's fair. The only reason I think that it could potentially be disassociative amnesia instead of just a metaphor for his grief/guilt is (mainly) because of the ending for the Hikikomori route, >!where you can clearly see him hesitate before committing, almost as if fighting against someone else from stabbing himself!<,6
Ok am happy,1
Oh don’t take my words the wrong way, dissociative amnesia is an extremely realistic assessment of the plot of the game. I’m just saying that making the assumption that the game is able-ist based off of it SEEMING like it’s about DID or dissociative amnesia is just stupid, since the game is completely and entirely free to interpretation. It’s one of the reasons why the Twitter users who think the game is able-ist are kind of dumb, since we don’t know if sunny is entirely aware or unaware of his past actions. But, when you hypothetically assume that the game refers to dissociative amnesia, it aligns with sunny’s reactions in the game, the timeline of how the player learns the events of the past, etc.,8
he looks emotional, which is probably the point-. most people aren't cute when they're screaming and crying </3,1216
Basil looks like he's about to lose it.,533
Looks like they are both having their worst mental breakdown yet,271
why would it be? she’s a good artist,155
in general? meh, closer to cute. . in this picture? homeboy is having a meltdown, neither lmao,100
Cute, but very concerning,143
it seems that both are about to commit cooperative suicide, and are about to lose all their sanity,40
He looks distressed, to be honest not the cutest facial trait in my book,95
He looks like he's having a mental breakdown lol,60
i don't think how attractive someone is is the focus when they're having a mental breakdown,22
Looks puncheable,123
adorable is my go-to word for basil so i say adorable,33
He looks so distraught,14
I don’t think ugly or cute is the question, really. He does look super emotional, which I feel is the point.,14
i just feel bad for basil... the dilemma he's facing,11
He looks like he just found out that kel drank the entire ornage joe supply and didn’t leave any for him,22
This is how ppl look In reality when having a break down,11
woah. i knew omocat was good at drawing. but wooah,10
He is very cute but "something behind you",9
Wonder what she meant by certain cutscene. I got some pointers but no clue otherwise.,9
Is anyone gonna mention the fact this was for a cutscene? Imagine that damn cutscene in-game dude...,16
he looks lowkey thirsty for sunny ngl,68

He looks like he’s about to have a mental breakdown.,2

Hmm does this mean Sunny was gonna emote or talk too? I doubt it but it's fun to imagine,2
r/yandere,2
He looks like he's having a mental breakdown. Also, I know we all know this but Omocat is so amazing at drawing.,2
I mean, he's ugly crying in that photo so...,2
i love that face,2
It looks like the raw expression of a broken man,2
His expressions match the dialogue so well; it brings out the fear and the anger perfectly. My conclusion: basil is perfec,2
Basil at his most mentally healthy.,2
Concerning, it looks concerning,2
Saw this image but someome drew over it adding hands and such and sunny was like "basil i cant believe youre a certified furry tm" and basil said "sunny i can explain!!". . I would love to see more memes of theses imqges its incredible,2
Basil is at his most adorable while suffering =o),1
Basil looks… well… you know…,1

Basil looks like he is a yandere  (I don’t know why),-10
He looks lewd. . Just replace the black with red and you get those faces,-13
menacing,1
I am far more concerned by smiling Sunny lol.,1
Scary,1
My boy cute,1
He looks desperate…,1
scary,1
sunny looks like he has no idea whats going on,1
Basil more like sus,1
😈😈😈,1
21 billion retweets,1
Scary,1
Neither - They both look drunk as shit if I‘m being honest with you,1
neither of those. he looks like he's going to accidentally choke someone to death,1
ugly,1
Im gonna guess its the scene >!before the fight!<,1
“It’s Mari’s fault for dying! Not yours, right!?”,1
He seems nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready.,1
Basil looks cute and he also looks like he's very embarrassed bc he's trying to confess to Sunny or something without context,1
None. It looks desperate, as it's probably meant to be,1
He looks horny if you ask me... which is a bit disturbing,1
He is scared, (because mari is right behind sunny) Sunny is scared (because basil has a knife) and im scared because i forgot to water his flowers (i hear knocking on my door),1
Cute Boi!,1
Horni,1
its basil , his face is always ugly #pissbabybasil /hj,1
I think it's cute, but... heh,1
Terrified, maybe aroused??,1
basil isn't ugly he's just annoying,1
Cute yandere nasıl 🔪🔪🔪 ❤❤❤,1
He always looks cute unarguably but one look and you can feel the shakiness, he looks hella nervous imo,1
Damn. I think he looks cute 😓,1
Basil is always cute.. . Except when he stabs you with garden shears... ***somehow.***. . Yeah, I really never understood how noodle arms femboy suddenly became able to gore a motherfucker with something that's pretty fuckin blunt.,1
I don't get what's the point of this question...,1
Anxious,1
He looks drunk.,1
Basil looks like he ran out of tears.,1
A little sus if u ask me,1
Cutgly.,1
It doesn't look "ugly", but it might lean in on the cute side, unintentionally. The word "emotional" also fits for Basil, not that much for the emptiness that is Sunny though.. . Anyways, their expressions are pretty nicely done.,1
3rd. Gay,1
Flirting or sexual harrasment?,1
hes delusional and having a mental breakdown i think hes cute in general but otherwise...its not meant to be cute LOL,1
What cutscene is this supposed to be?. . Also I noticed it says jam instead of jan,1
true. people talk about ugly criers as if we're supposed to look cute while tweaking the fuck out,484
Basil: "HOW COULD YOU DO THAT!?!". . Basil: "THAT'S MEAN SUNNY! THAT'S SO MEAN!!". . Sunny: "I just don't get what's so funny about a fat bugs bunny",413
Yeah and besides he still looks extremely cute for someone screaming and crying,58
When is he not about to lose it?,299
pretty sure he had already lost it by that point,85
man's about to go sicko mode,22
ngl for Sunny a mental breakdown probably looks like that. . Besides that time where he grabbed his head in that one animation,156
Although I had been earnestly daydreaming until then, I suddenly started to laugh. “I see two lovers looking over the edge of the cauldron of hell. Are they contemplating a double suicide? This means their love will end in hell.” I couldn’t stop laughing.,20
lmao!!1,23
Flair checks out,69
Submissive and beatable,51
like anime characters?,7
>!probably the “something behind you” part!<,18
This coulda been a cutscene already in game too. I honestly was thinking that this was the >!Fight scene towards the end!<,19
Wait **lowkey?!**,34
it Looks so ugly for me,1
Fuck bagel,-4
Nah,He's a Boy,3
No.,7
Ok,1
You have 08 in your name, I win by order of "stfu kid",1
This. We make all these memes and jokes, but honestly, his character development is on point. OMOCAT is a great storyteller. After all that happened, he sure would be a wrecked, messed up pile of anxiety. >!Like, damn, Sunny, you traumatized the boy for life and then ghosted him for FOUR years? No wonder he's a yandere now.!<,156
I'd give this an award if I had one,47
I hate sunny now, thanks,15
Good question.,116
Fair point there.,41
Lmao, yea.,4
This is gonna sound evil but I absolutely love the animation before Sunny gets Stressed Out.,96
that was oddly specific,11
Where is this quote from?,4
god damn y'all lmao poor guy,16
Looks very breedable rn,2
No gross sobbing,5
[Warning: I'm not sure if I did the reddit spoiler tag correctly- if I didn't; Spoiler ahead] . . They look like kids here to me, so my first thought was >!when we see Sunny push his sister!<. . Edit: OK yeah I did it correctly,5
Precisely, but it's a cutscene man! Cutscenes are epic!,4
High key is minor,39
Makes a comment with an unpopular opinion on a fictional character to see what happens/ how toxic the fandom is . . Gets downvoted. . Guess I’ll unsub??,1
I see... I forgot the fact that anime's boys look like girls.,1
Boy stfu,-6
Someone’s mad 💀💀💀,1
Pardon? All I said was Sunny looks punchable in that art. It’s not a big deal go get a life,-2
>!To be fair staging an accident to look like a suicide is even worse than causing the accident i think they traumatized each other!<. . Edit: This is extra messed up if >!Mari was still alive until they hanged her!<,86
I’m not the only one lol. It’s impressive from a technical standpoint and wonderfully expresses strong emotions. It’s a very nice piece of animation. Intense emotions are fun to portray and see in art imo,19

Oh wait, we talking about Kel? Guess this is canon now,5
nah that's if Basil was a fish,8
: Good thing I always carry a knife \*stabby stab-stab in the stomach\*  . : That was a weird-ass dream. I should probably visit Kel.,68

i bet humphrey cosplayers really fucking loved the air conditioning,566
There must be a lot of cosplayers down there.,298
Tell us if the macrons were worth it. That line looks like pain lol.,172
Inflatable costume jawsome my beloved,173
I'm still in line. Shall upload more when I get in the store,77
Looked like it was fun. Sad I couldn't be there.,48
I wish I could go so bad. Where is this?,28
I fucking wish i was there,27
That Jawsum cosplay has stolen my heart.,17
I wish I could've been there... I hope you had fun though!,13
On the one hand, going there will remain one funny, european day dream for me.. . But on the other hand, god that‘s looking like a long line…,12
omg chibi kel is too cute,13
Depression bait,9
[deleted],7
I'm British what is this I'm jealous aaaaaaaa,4
ah não kdhfkdkjvahgsd,10
Wow, this place looks amazing.,6
There was an event?,5
Damn you are so lucky you could go,5
man i wish i could go,,, ;-;,2
MAN I LOVE THAT PLACE! I WISH SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME OF THIS EVENT SOONER! THANK YOU FOR THE PICTURES!,6
i left a few hours ago, if you are still in line i hope to god you've gotten there by now,4
I WANT TO GO TO THIS PLACE RN. . . Too bad im brazilian, hahaha haha.....hah........... (Crying),5
I need to go there,3
MR JAWSUM IS REAL,3
I’m honestly so jealous it lokks like so much funnnn,3
drove an hour out but i ended up just going shopping instead bc i gave up on the line lmaooo like there was no way… on the other hand i was very happy to see an unexpectedly large number of omori fans around that area :’),3
Salute those that remembered to take photos,3
This feels surreal,2
You’re so lucky that you got to go!,2
WHAAAAT I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS AN OMORI COLLAB THIS LOOKS SO COOL BUT TEDIOUS,2
I love this,2
Whereabouts is this?,2
Is that Totebag new merch??,2
oh how i wish to be there,2
Man, I wish I could go there.,2
Damnnn,2
I went there with my boyfriend to try and get into the event. . We already gave up waiting when we saw the super long line :'). . I did not expect to see so many people there,2
were is this at?,2
I want to eat there,2
I couldn’t make it 😭,2
waiting in line took around 6 hours but getting the merch was so worth it LOL . . &#x200B;. . i also saw a lot of cool cosplays plus we got free stickers so it was fun :),2
I am utterly jealous by the looks of the images, I wish PLUTO would assist in traveling,2
This was definitely an interesting event. I ended up having to leave before I got anywhere near the front, but just seeing so many folks show up (especially in cosplay) and talking to people was still a great experience,1
Man that place looks awesome,1
WHY HAS NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS,1
location? england? US?,1
This game is so popular it came to life!,1
Mommy why is there a ghost hanging in the trees?,1
We all fucking love air conditioning.,150
I'm a Humphrey cosplayer and I indeed do fucking love air conditioning,186
Ya -- I've seen so many! And many people wearing merch,200
I couldn't even get any macarons because they were all sold out :( and yeah the line is so long!!,131
I’ve had macrons from them before & they’re super yummy! Would def recommend,24
macron démission,9
was not worth it. I wasn’t able to get macarons but I stayed in line for merch and they all sold out :( 12 hours of waiting for just a couple of freebies i couldve just bought from the online store,2
I internally screamed when I saw Jawsum's costume, he's my favorite character. Unfortunately I am from Latin America and will probably never be able to buy merch because I am poor lmao.,65
godspeed, i defected but got postcards luckily,29
do you have more pictures of jawsum cosplayers,12
Line is ridiculously long, spanning several blocks. I've been here for 4 hours and haven't even reached the shop yet. It's still neat seeing all the cool cosplays, at least!,46
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!](),14
In Irvine, California,28
It was actually an official costume the staff members put on,14
They made Omori macaroons and it's amazing, too bad the preorders sold out within 5 minutes,15
it's a mystery,3
I'm not too sure, I didnt get one because I was too late I think lol,3
Seriously.... . No Unbread twins cosplaying at a Macaron event for Omori?. . They are literally French.. . My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.,66
Damn ;-; Is there even anything else other than the macrons?,55
I didn't know there were so many Omori Fans in and around LA.,28
Latin America? I'm from fucking Italy. That shop doesn't even exist here. Feeling sad right now, might commit oyasumi,27
i love the capitalist shark so much it's unreal,29
Hang in there! I'm sure you'll make it there eventually.,15
holy shit thats actually nearby,25
Thats the polar opposite side of the country. . . Fuck,15
Damn I wish I knew this. What a cute little colab,5
Wait, at the spectrum?,3
Thank you for the response!,2
That’s.. the best idea ever. If they do this again I will cosplay as them with my sister!,31
There is some special merch, I think(shirts),65
That’s where Omocat’s from so it’s only natural,19
I've heard people came there from all around the u.s but i would be surprised if someone travelled to the us just to be there lol,5
In Latin America it's the same, we only have the most famous food chains like Mc Donalds, but nothing else from US. Not even a good comic store with Omori merch ;-;,15
Yes yes,3
Heh, good for you then!. . Too bad my sister will be leaving for college, we are going to Cali for a week soon though since that's where her university is.. . But you go far with that idea, I haven't seen it yet.,11
They don’t sell lemonade? Man that sucks.,37
Here in Brazil we have piticas, it's a good comics and games store but unfortunately I've never seen an omori shirt or any indie game,8
YOOOOOOOO,3
Not even any good ol' orange joe?,8
In Britain, they basically say: “Hey! You can order these things from the US! Isn’t that great? For shipping, it’s the low low price of £30 for regular shipping (6-10 weeks) or £100 for deluxe shipping (2 weeks)! So we can get merch, but only after selling one if our limbs on the black market.,10

,67
Reminds me, when I was getting reference, Bridget is actually shorter than even Basil lower end estimate, Bridget is 158 cm but Basil is definitely 160cm+ in all estimate I’ve seen lol.. . It’s just the game art style (especially fighting game) is different so Bridget have far taller proportion in their style while omori is more cartoonish smaller proportion,37

Omori and Deltarune next to the super hardcore heavy rock fast paced action fighter with a story revolving around human bioweapons and a worldwide apocalypse is juxtaposition at it’s finest,42

sorry what's bridget's game about?,5
Are you talking about Bayonetta 3?!,2

noooo why must you hurt me this way 😔,20
Oh god AAAAAAA :”(,19
"You're not supposed to be older than she could have been." Oof. That hurt. Also love seeing any sort of comic with eye patch sunny because it means they forgave him :),23

happiness and sadness in a single image,2
This is so well written. The fact that Sunny is dealing with that feels so real, and if you and Omocat had the same art style I would have *easily* mistaken this for being official. Best fan comic I've seen by far. I'm gonna go cry now.,2

I am sad now,2
Aight so this one really really got me. I don't normally post on reddit but this one was really good. My fiance of what would be 15 years now passed away 4 years ago. She was older than I was. Turning 24 was my hardest birthday cause I was older than her. Now I'm turning 27. Good comic.,2

Yes’s it.,1
U made us feel everything,41
Yes, *something*,28
If the game made you feel a powerful emotional stab to the heart, you didn’t convey a fraction, for those who played the whole game, your comic gave us another whole stab and then some,39

Most fandoms for M rated games are like this tbh,222
This subreddit makes me feel ancient.. . Also how tf did you post this without an interesting title?,162
I mean, GTA is rated M for Mature, yet half of its fanbase is under 18. We're not that special,308
I am now... But not really when i played,77
Oh please we know most of the audience of m rates are people under 18+ given that preteen and and teens like the feeling of playin something more “mature”,68
Lmao imagine being a minor literally just grow up,41
I'm a 43 yo father of 3,39
Great I feel old now…and I'm only 22,52
that's something I noticed on TikTok. I amassed a small following by making some memes and positivity posts about OMORI and decided to follow my followers back (at least, some of them, before I burnt out), and the next thing I knew, my Friends tab was cluttered with DNI posts, posts about random thoughts, and memes made by obvious minors.. . no hate at all, really. it just seems jarring to me that so many fans are kids. they have my sympathies. I heard of other fandoms engaging in unfortunate behavior when I was around 15.,42
Fr so,13
Half of us are unaware with the age rating of the game,6
50% of this fanbase is teenagers,4
omori isnt scary its only scary when you know why it should be scary.. . . so that means its not scary since my head is made of concrete,5
I still genuinely think Omori is best played as an older teen. I've always figured people get less and less tolerant of that whole cutesy teen angst story stuff the older they get. I definitely woulda enjoyed the story more at, idk, 14 than I did now. The game doesn't deserve an 18+ rating as far as I'm concerned.,3
Fair enough. Im 17.,3
Hey I'm only 4 years to young...,3
Damn that makes sense considering some of the posts here.,3
Im 25,3
Well how can we be mature if we don’t play something mature?,3
I feel like age rating for games are more like a rough indication for what the game is like. I played the game a bit below the age limit and was turned off by the age rating and content warning at first, but since I’ve never had huge problems with darker themes I decided to still try it. In the end I feel like I was less disturbed than some adults I saw the game play or read comments of. So yeah, the 18+ rating (16 in some places) is more of a warning to tell people it’s not just a cute game before they buy it, because experiences can differ a lot if you’re a 25 year old who personally struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts or a 14 year old who has seen too much of the internet.,3
me being 1 year old,3
should be at least 13+,7
facts,2
Facts,2
To be fair thats how most games are.  For example, most shooting games /nm,2
,2
I'm 17 so guess I'm close,2
In Japan, they rated it for C (+15) for violence and drinking/smoking,2
Oh yeah. . gambling,2
Newbie: "Awww, this game looks cute! I think I'll give it a try.". . Game: Starts with a Content Warning.. . Newbie: "Oh! Oooooohh...",2
Technically rated M games are 17+ by ESRB standards but it still applies because so many of you are still younger than 17 and it makes me feel ancient,2
close,2
this game does not fucking deserve an m rating, i’ve watched a playthrough of the entire thing and i’ve still got a few years to go until 18,1
IM TEN AND ⟟ PLAY THE GAME MESS WITH ME ⟟ DARE YOU,1
*ew children*,1
COUGH,0
Age is just a number guys,-28
real,1
Theoretically speaking what if i was underage?,1
Jokes on you, I am old enough, but still sad,1
Every teenager on their way to play a Mature Rated Game,1
*laughs in 13*,1
I played it when I was 15. Don't recommend.,1
I'm nearly 19 tho??,1
Ok let's be honest...who cares whenever a game is 18+,1
It makes sense since the main characters in the game are teens and we see the story through their eyes, so it's bound to get attaintion from teenagers,1
It would've been rated e for everyone but Humphrey says fuck,1
Ahem...,1
 indeed,1
are there any other indies that are M rated,1
Touché,1
yikes all this time ive been interacting with children?,1
Imagine being 18 and older in 2022 💀,1
I played trough the game and had to check twice to see if it is really mature, not 13+,1
They could in this very comment section right now!,209
They could be your MOTHER!,15
Danganronpa,95
Even thought its not a game hazbin hotel/helluva boss can almost get to air on youtube kids with the amount of kids that watch it,7
. ͏͏͏͏͏͏,82
I'm not sure if this is true anymore, but for a while the average age of a Pokemon player was higher than the average age of a Call of Duty player.,127
Still? Have many people started playing 5 in the last year? I assumed all of the under 18s will be atleast in their 20s by the next release anyhow,15
Same,9
honestly i didnt even look at or consider the rating when i bought the game,18
Honestly, I don't really see the thrill of playing more mature games, but I guess that's just some people. I just think Omori was really interesting, I love psychological horror games like this ,13
I'm 16, I played it because I absolutely love the story. I also like psychoanalyzing characters and trying to guess foreshadowing, so that was also a big part of the fun.,30
Im happy for you u/big-poo-fart! ,30
Don't worry I'm 24,25
37.  It’s ok.,13
same ,12
Ditto,4
I know that feeling.,3
Am 25 😂😭,3
same here!! we exist,2
a game about teens is inevitably gonna attract a lot of minors as it’s audience,31
Having this experience right now. Posted to tiktok for the first time. Omori inspired art with omori tags. Got tons of likes, I went to spy on who was liking it, and lots of them are teenagers. . Kinda concerns me tbh. I was planning on posting kind of mature themes.,9
One of them was 12. . I immediately disassociated with omori tiktok,5
I’m pretty sure for the longest time, at least over here in Europe, the game had been sitting at Pegi 16. It was only on the week the console release was taking place that they upped it to Pegi 18. I want to assume Humphrey had something to do with it,3
Considering the visuals and topics that the game touches on, Omori would more likely be traumatizing to kids under 16/18.,1
No wait mature is 17+ what the fuck am i saying,6
I'm 10 years too young :(,2
Same. Realizing people 10+ years younger than me enjoy the stuff I do has been a fun thing to come to grips with.,8
The ESRB M rating is a weird one. . . Because on one hand, you have games like Omori or Skyrim which have a little profanity, dark themes, and violent imagery, but then on the other side you have GTA 5 and Cyberpunk 2077 with graphic violence, full frontal nudity, and excessive profanity. . . I almost feel like the ESRB should split M into a 15-16+ and an 18+ (though technically AO exists but is a death sentence for video game).,22
*16+,23
well, while the game's mature content is rather tame, I'm of the opinion that 13-year-olds should be protected from such distressing themes involving, y'know, depression, anxiety, and >!suicide, both real and fake!<.. . sure, mental health struggles exist at any age, but I don't think a kid who's fresh out of an American sixth grade is necessarily ready to deal with this kind of content. Sunny and Basil themselves demonstrate that in-game,17
Close,1
What? There wasn't any openly shown drinking smoking lol. I mean if you consider >!Aubrey's parents!< then yeah but still,1
Just because you were fine watching it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve an M rating. Black Space, Black Space 2, the Truth and, conversely, how blunt it's presented >!with Mari's hanging body as an enemy in both routes!< and its blunt portrayal of suicide in Headspace >!but also in multiple endings!< isn't suited for most younger teenagers. You could make an argument that 16+ is more suitable than an M raiting, but we don't really have that.. . Y'all aren't babies, I know that. I was consuming horror content myself as a teenager. But not every teenager can handle that. My little sister couldn't and she's only a year and a half younger than me. She still can't usually handle horror even as an adult. And honestly a lot of the end game content like Black Space, Black Space 2, and the Truth section are distressing even as an adult. Let alone a younger teenager whom might not be prepared/able to handle that type of content.,12
bruh if ur ten wtf are you doing on reddit,14

Oh god Danganronpa,68
I'm not in that fandom, but it scares me.,34
Especially that one.,19
Yeah, I know. It sucks.,2
Oh, why didn't you say so?,58
A friend of mine was begging her parents to let her play GTA 5 when it was released. She was 13 then and now she's 22 and still plays the game,7
GTA V, probably not a lot, but with the prevalence of GTA online youtubers (most of them try to be "kid-friendly" too) I wouldn't be surprised if a huge chunk of GTA players are under 18.,5
Yeah i literally never look at the ratings of anything,8
I am 15, played it because of all the hype lol. But now I actually like the game because it gives you a whole new look on teenagers mental health and different types of parents, including toxic ones,2
My wife hates me, my oldest son became an incel, my daughter's wife won't let us see each other, and my youngest son is just in general a disappointment,22
Boomer gang,13
No way for real bro?,3
We're still young! ,6
Yeah they literally upped the rating because of that one phrase that only appears with a chance and is a one off. . But the game also has su!c!de, self hate, depression and they be like: "I sleep" LOL double standards,1
But why? I've watched a thousand movies worse than Omori and I've come out the other end relatively untraumatized. There's really nothing that bad about Omori's storyline.,2
True gaming being enjoyed by multiple generations boomers  be like you can't do that i exist,2
so just like the European PEGI, yet both Omori and Skyrim are rated 18 here.,1
I would argue that "That's the point" but I'm far too ignorant regarding children,7
There are plenty of preteens in the world experiencing depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts at this very moment.. . That said, I also wouldn't recommend the game to young kids but for a completely different reason.,3
you underestimate what those kids know at that age,2
,1
actually if there was a 16+ rating that would probably fit more,2
im normally really sensitive to horror games but this one was mostly fine,2
This sounds like satire to me tbh, especially seeing the use of a seemingly different "I" symbol?,10
nah better to just leave reddit this place sucks,7
Put three more years on top of that tbh,-2

Hecc yeah we are! ,3
Preach it pal ,3
Everyone has different tolerances, your circumstances and ability to digest these things are not similar to the mass majority population of that age group if you're 14. . . Omori's topics are dark in the sense of mental health awareness and having crippling feelings of self deprecation, unhealthy addiction for nostalgia, and death.,2
For me it's more like "Oh fuck I'm a full grown adult now" than being mad teenagers like the games I like lol. I WAS ONE OF YOU ONCE. I REMEMBER.,3
your argument is valid, I’ll admit. I mean, books like Thirteen Reasons Why, All the Bright Places, Looking for Alaska, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower discuss mental illness and target YA audiences, which I think is great seeing how important it is. I just think 13, at least for a typical kid, is probably two or three years early.. . maybe I’m just sensitive, but seeing >!Basil’s fate!< in the Neutral endings was tough even at 22,3
I’m aware of the spread of mental health struggles, and believe they should be acknowledged in teen-friendly media. I just think the way it’s shown in this game might not suit an average 13-year-old. if I had a kid that age, sure, I’d be comfortable talking mental illness out. hell, I’ll admit, maybe I’d be willing to let them play this game with a conversation to make sure they’re ready.. . but I still feel like the bar for this portrayal should be a little higher. I’d like to hear your reasoning.,4
Good bot,1
I agree there. If 16+ existed it would be a more suitable rating than M.,2
idk their very small comment history looks like how a 12 year old would comment, by extension a 10 year old. Ive been there before so i can kinda tell. Still just a guess tho,0

Damn,1
I'd argue otherwise. I've asked (and honestly just already know) that 0 of my friends have experienced any sort of "trauma" from playing Omori, or any similar game for that matter. Obviously my friend group and I do not represent the entire population, but I'd say we're pretty darn close.. . Hot take time if you'll bear with me for a minute. A lot of people nowadays like to claim trauma from a lot of things. Sometimes they do it for a joke, sometimes (a lot of times) they do it for attention, etc... Point is that if a game like Omori really traumatized that many people, the world would have bigger issues than the age rating of a game. Also, Reddit is not a great place to judge such things as mental health etc.,3
Yes im like oh that's what games are today back in my day we had Pokémon emerald we put chairs in our secret base og metaverse,1
I really gotta stop clicking those spoiler things b4 finishing the game,3
Actually >!his fate!< Was something that 8 year old me had to deal with in first person, so if it were for me personally i would rate this game even lower lol,1
I think the story is best experienced when someone's past their childhood because the game touches upon nostalgia and cherishing past moments and memories with your friends, which should resonate more with the older crowd. You can only experience the story for the first time once so it's probably better to do so when one can more fully appreciate it.,5

oh hell yeah. that’s just as great a reason. once you see the photo album at the start of the game, you get this incredible sense that you’ve known all these characters for a while, and you feel their nostalgia with them.. . kinda like how I felt when I first watched Friends about four years ago.,2

 Basil's maniac face- **STEP ON ME.**,192
Manic be like:oh my sunny u have grown~,231
This is lovely, looks like it belongs in the game! I was hoping someone would do Basil since he’s one of my favourites (I mean, I like them all but...). Also props for covering the whole range of emotions too!,104
Awwww, manic Basil is the first manic face I see that's actually cute and not demented,98
Basil’s manic face.... . B-Basil... please put down those shears...,71
Really good work! I dunno if manic Basil is cute or scary yandere vibes.,59
This looks incredible!!!! I love it!!! My favorite’s gotta be the toast one,34
Manic basil Brianrot you did very well,36
Everything is perfect, the manic feels like he’s looking down on me (´・ω・｀),26
I absolutely love this!. . Basil is just best boy, tbh.,25
i love the manic basil he cant look scary even if he tried,28
I want to know, where did you get the accurate toast png?,23
Looks like it's taken straight from the game, awesome work!,19
nice!,13
Wow, this looks great! I love how all the expressions are in character,13
this is SO CUTE,10
omg this is awesome!! you nailed the game's art style❤️❤️,10
Heyyyyy, that's pretty good!,9
THIS IS AMAZING!!! I THINK IT MIGHT BE THE BEST I'VE SEEN SO FAR BECAUSE IT'S SO DAMN ACCURATE AND BELIEVABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR BASIL!!!.  Seriously, you did an amazing job! Also, Manic Basil is more terrifying than manic Omori, just sayin'~,8
I LOVE IT I love it so much.. I might try to do an AU about basil soon, if i can i'll draw it entirely myself, but just in case,  could i borrow it as a base? (not the template, basil.) (idk, its still on the plan stages).,8
oh my god, that manic face is so damn cute,8
happy basil  . bottom text,9
Manic Basil manic Basil 💓,8
The only critique that I have is the third emotion could've been more "extreme" (though it's my opinion), the artstyle however was perfectly done you deserve cookie.,7
You did God's work.  Congrats. Easily on of the best posts on this subreddit 💕💖,8
Everything here looks amazing, though I would suggest that the stressed out portrait have the red eyes seen during the basil's house cutscene.,7
I decided to redo it, a bit closer to the real thing by OMOCAT. if anyone wants them in high resolution, here it is: [,6
This is extremely well done, i adore it,5
so precious oml,5
I reopened my reddit account after god know how many years just to say this:  . the manic's face is by far more scarier than furious, its been a while since i have seen such a "imma ravage your body" look like that, Omori just there having way too much fun and Basil there having fun even after the fight.,7
You are from the future, aren't you?,6
He got toast basil right,5
Aww, this is gorgeous!,4
This look perfect! Like its straight from the game :D,4
Manic basil a cute,3

Basil Toast,5
There needs to be Omori p2 and Basil joins the fight or something,3
manic basil oh my!!!\~,3
thank god manic basil doesn't look like a psychopath,3
The furious one could be like Omori but with both eyes shown like Stranger,3
at first i thought the flowers surrounding manic basil was weed,3
I live for ecstatic basil,3
basil toast basil toast,3
manic one look so sick but not crazy, **i love it.**,3
Furious Basil: You killed my sunflower and now i'm going to use you as fertilizer.,3

So cool, saw these in omori tenor gifs and turned the internet on it's head to find them lmao,3
manic basil looks like hes saying "ara ara",3
angery basil is so cursed,3
Basils angry sprite looks like someone said the word frick or heck in the playground and now he's pissed, it's so cute I cant,3
Baisl tost 💀,3
Could you please share the color palette with me?,3
VERY COOL!,3
Ooh these are pretty. I think some of Basil's original portraits would fit better for some but its still super good!!!,2
Bro predicted the future,2
:D,2
Where are the red eyes.,2
Holy shit, you nailed it...! Bravo!! Seriously!!!   . Btw, for uploading gifs, as long as you've got the file and you're uploading from desktop, you should just be able to just choose to upload the file when you're posting something. At least, it was barely difficult for me when I did it.  . Also, I don't know why you're crediting me, lol. Yer not even using my template, and the other guy's template actually uses the correct backgrounds, rather than my lazy attempt at recreating them, haha.,99
Aw this is Beautiful lovely job!! :DDD ♥️,7
Hello! Are you still here? Where do I find these as individual gifs/images from your own distribution?. . I want them as both gifs and images. Your link has them all in a single gif/image without being separated one by one.. . And yes, your Basil battle portraits are honestly better than the official Basil battle portraits :3,1
horni bastard,52
no he looks like hes gonna kill someone,9
Bro he's 12!!!,8
Do you mean that YOU want Basil to step on YOU? Or do you mean that BASIL wants someone to step on HIM???,1
yeah alot of the manic faces we've seen on this template have looked weirdly sexual taken out of context,149
Still though, I want to delete it,25
are you sure about that bc half the comment section wants to funk him rn,13
Whatever your interpretation of cute is, it is not mine and therefore, I must disagree with you entirely.,3
Well the duologue before his fight is him yelling at sunny not to leave him. So not to out of character,21
I mean he looks like he’s about to rape me,19
It's actually the first image that pops up when you search for toast png: . http://www.pngmart.com/files/5/Toast-PNG-Free-Download.png,22
Thanks!! Of course, glad I can help, looking forward to it!,7
Thanks for the feedback! I was a bit too worried about it staying in character that I forgot to exaggerate it \^\^',10
thanks couldnt find these anywhere,1
Thank you so much!!                                                                                                                           Ah, so that's how you do it! It didn't load at first so I thought I did it wrong..                            Come on, give yourself a bit more credit ♥️ ! Your template was the reason I did this so I  had to credit you :),27
Happy cake day!,1
ITS SO CANNON AAAAA,11
step,2
Not like the canon game helped out with that impression. Ecstatic Omori already look like he's on drugs as it is, Manic is a couple redrawn eyes away from being an ahegao face,182
Wouldn't say it's yandere to want an understanding shoulder to cry on, but I get what you mean, haha,11
or maybe he’s just gonna make you some pesto?????,13
Once again still great job!,3
Thanks!!  I am really glad you like it  ♥️,7
why -. . why did you comment this,65
Considering maniac is sunny bottled up emotions exploding in happiness, this actually make much sense,49
i think this comment has cursed my bloodline,29
Uh-,32
[removed],10
you are right for some reason,7
Idk I feel like sunny means more to basil than just a friend you can come to. You might just say that. *it means everything* to basil,7
Wtf is pesto is that noodle?,13
Ofc!,10
>!You’ll force your brother to learn to perfectly play on your favorite songs on the violin inevitability leading up to him pushing you down the stairs accidentally killing you and hating himself about for at least 4 years?!<,5
Well, I won't deny the possibility that Basil views Sunny as more than a friend, but I still think, in that moment, it was more of an abandonment/comfort thing, since Sunny was the only other person alive who could understand what Basil was going through.,13
: wtf is pesto is that noodle?,2
I get that. It means everything is the name of the song that plays when you fight Aubrey in the church if you didn't catch the reference,9
Aha, don't worry, I noticed it- ya little sneak :p,8

Not going outside isn't introvertion, . Social anxiety is not introvertion,. Antisocial disorder is not introvertion,. Having no friends is not introvertion,. . AÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. . . . . . No offense ofc,4

Shut-In Does Dream of Bunny Girl Aubrey,171

Your caption is definitely correct!!,4
I really wish that there was more of an interaction with killing the bunnies or not killing them. I spent the entire game running from any encounter with bunnies because I thought killing them would permanently affect the story by making aubrey mad,4
I LOVE EVERY SINGLE DRAWING YOU DO ITS ALL SO PRETTY, THE ANIMATION IS SO COOL TOO.,6
AAA i love this💕,3
Pretty sure this is a spoiler, but great art either way!,3
Time to earn leafie's rewards,3

how lovely,7
First impression: What a nice picture of Sunny and Mari.. . Second impression: >!Wait, why is the sky in the background? Hmmmmmmmm!<,461
Great/sad art. On a more serious note. . >!Is the Mari during the dream sequence actually her soul/spirit that tries to help Sunny move on/Tell him she forgives him or is it just a figment of his own imagination finding ways to cope? Hell it is probably just me coping,wanting to hope/get some closure that Mari is allright and forgives him.!<,202
Oh god, the feels qwq. . But amazing art,79
this is during the GOOD ending and nobody can tell me otherwise,69

Oh. Oh no.,35
Oh no,11
I feel bad,10
but he's missing his eye. so it's not that ending. right? or am I miss remembering something,6
Don't worry it's just a window behind them,2
Might as well be. There are slight hints to the supra natural in omori. They're placed well enough to not interfere too much with the main plot. For example, the cowboy guy sort of hints at the idea of a nexus of dream worlds,145
"Hell it is probably just me coping,wanting to hope/get some closure that Mari is allright and forgives him.". . \^. . ~~I just want wholesome ghost Mari and Sunny moments OMOCAT, make it canon~~,40
Idk how that would be possible but i wish.,24
Idk bro, that backround is saying something different,19

True TRUE Ending,4
I cry everyday those.,3
Yes,2
Sure,1
***It’s Mari spirit***,5
CLOSE,151
I think he can still be missing an eye in the bad ending. Save Basil, lose the final fight, don’t get up, and boom. It’s a long way down from there.,15
Yeah maybe. It is fairly ambigious. Like the whole dreamscape/whatever is obvs way to...weird to be totaly realistic so its hard to say how much is just meant to be fantasy/manifastion of emotiosn and what could be supernatural.. . Due to how it is presented and how it is uniqe to everything else in whitespace/dreamworld i am inclinded to belive it is sora real.. . Despite all the stuff in Omoro i feel the game is ultimatley "somewhat optimistic" and not needlessly cruel if you choose the good ending so who knows,62
Thats what it comes down to in the end huh. As life of pi says "its all about the act of letting go and saying goodbye".. . Mari and sunny loved each other dearly so the thought their last moment together was a fight is hard to bear. Thats why i cope lawl. Hoping her soul still loves him and says its Allright and that he can know it. Aka what we dont get irl. . Also a reminder to always treasure your family and those you love and care about.. . You never know what might happen. Having your last encounter be a bad one can haunt you like something did to sunny.,36
Could be a dream. We don’t know that! Could just be crying about Mari outside of the hospital, it doesn’t imply anything TOO dangerous!,3
:(,17
..... what has my life become,7
the question still stands user heroswordkein,1
I think you mean. . #C L O T H E S,167
Your eyes,51
I mean, it’s probably just my interpretation, but I feel the dream world thing is not too crazy considering how crazy actual lucid dreams can be. Like if Sunny was a natural lucid dreamer I don’t think it’s too unreasonable to believe he could imagine an entire world to play out his escapism in.,37
The fact that he’s holding onto her tells me that he knows she is there and can feel/see her! <333. . I choose to believe that she came back… I don’t care how. I just do… I can’t cope any other way…,3

It's not actually in the game... but it is on Twitter if you wanna go digging through Omocat's page. (Or at least it was.

I don't remember it exactly, but it's like... Orange Fanta and... some kind of coffee.,6

Basil is a plant,1
Indeed it was,9
>!My headcanon: Many months after the game's end, Aubrey and Basil become friends again. Of course, they both still feel guilty for what they did, but slowly, everything is getting better. Aubrey decides to move in with Basil after him offering many times and her mother's continued neglect. Yes, all of the characters still have their personal issues to deal with, but bit by bit, things are looking up. Polly design inspired by !<[this post]() :) This took incredibly long (due to lack of motivation mostly) but I do have more comics like these planned, although it'll be a little while before the next one. And of course, this is just a headcanon so feel free to put your own in the comments.,668
The Good Ending,248
I now cannot unthink about Aubrey accidentally calling Polly Mom. And being extremely embarassed.. . And Basil consoling her, telling that this is a thing that happened to him too.,222
The bunny sparks joy,150
This is perfect,63
Words cannot express how much I love this.,63
I AM GOING TO CRY,52
This gave me the same feeling as Omocat's character birthday comics, I love it so much!,45
Your art is really cute!,43
Aubrey's mom kinda looking like a zombie- Aubrey made the right choice. :D,36
Who’s the other woman?  Polly?,29
I really like this comic and art style. I also liked how Aubrey’s mom looked just like an older version of her, since my headcannon for after the bad ending is that Aubrey eventually becomes just like her mom.,23
Aaaaaaa so cute, and I love that it looks almost offical,21
Nice to see other people with headcanons like mine!,15
thought the mom only drank,12
She never had an actual room in years i feel so bad but also so happy,12
This is amazing. I don’t really know what to say, I’m just glad everyone is relatively happy. Thank you for making this, good work,11
im not crying, you are,10
aubeyyyyyyyyyyy you mind if i steal this idea for a fic im planning,9
this is the best headcanon from omori that ive seen 🥺 my heart💜💜💜,11
God that moment when her mom asks and you can see all the emotion she wants to scream before calming down is so powerful.,11
Adorable!,8
This is so adorable!,8
Our headcanon,9
I'm going to cry this is beautiful what,9
I approve of this head cannon! 👍,8
okay this is what i pray happens now,10
FINALLY, something good happened in Aubrey's life    :D :),9
Hmmm, I have a sudden urge to ship them,24
wholesome . . thx for the work !,7
İ AM DYİNG OF CUTENESS HELP,8
I love this so much, amazing work,8
I love this so much,7
this is phenomenal and you got the original art style down so perfectly!,9
Wholesome :D,8
Why did her mom even ask? She should’ve already known the answer.,7
Do I spot a smidge of regret in Aubrey's mom when she leaves?,6
Happy Auby and happy Bagel makes me happy.,6
>!at first i thought it was mari standing next to basil and i was just freaking out about mari and everything then i realized it was just the aid !<  to be honest i really like this head canon my head canon is the sunny x aubrey ship and i having thought far ahead,11
oh hey, I've thought about this scenario happening as well! In fact, planning for it to happen in a fic I'm writing lol.,5
I love this so much, so cute, so sweet, post canon Aubrey and Basil friendship gives me life. Also that little 'awkward awkard' is so fricking adorable.,5
AaAaAaAaaaaaAaaAa MY HEART IS MELTING!  . The headcanon is very cute and believable and the art is so good, amazing work man!,3
why is she an eggplant,4
somehow it makes me happy inside just to see everything go well and nice and i wish that happened,5
That 3 panel pause after responding hit me like a sack of bricks.,3
This gives me the happy brain juice,4
This is really good, amazing,3
Oh my fucking god he called himself "marscapone". . Just to be clear: i'm not angry at you, i'm just a little disappointed. Really good art though,4
Oh shit I thought that Polly was Mari for a sec and got confused,3
Had to read it a second time because i didn't realize it's like a manga,5
owie this one hurt. but I absolutely love this hc!!,4
Everyone gangsta until Bun-Bun starts eating all of Basil’s plants,5
this is so good,3
Buddy this is too good, thank you for making this! I'm definitely headcannoning it!,3
this is canon now,3
This is absolutely wholesome!,3
noice.,3
"Probably not." *(SLAM)* XD,2
gosh dang it I haven't cried in a while. Thanks,2
Truly great art. I was missing this dimension of the ending and I am happy to have seen it. Great job,2
Good shit good shit,2
Mate, this is beautiful, I'm subbing to u,2
I don’t think Aubrey is short for Aubergine lol. . Aubergine is what Brits call Eggplants 🍆. . Edit: I stand corrected,3
This is after the good ending or bad ending?,1
Nice,1
i hope omocat makes this canon,1
Sobbing take my upvote,1
,1
Polly's pretty much is the best conclusion for Aubrey, because... obviously the current status is not good.. . Anyways, wholesome.,1
that was incredible, excellent work!,138
**Absolutely work.**. . >!Will Aubrey meet Sunny again in your headcannon!< ;—;,202
Personally I was worried that if >!Basil's grandma died that he could lose the house.!<. . Hopefully Polly would sort something out.,15
I'm just a bit confused, is this supposed to be read left to right or right to left? It kind of works either way but yeah!,1
**MORE LIKE BEST ENDING**,164
They are sibilings, children of Polly. Thanks for the headcanon,68
indeed it does :),39
SAME LET ME CRY WITH YOU,30
it was so hard to resist drawing her as i drew the other characters haha,36
Yeah,31
It's Aubreys mom.,4
daang that's dark but a great headcanon!,14
I feel like she looks like mari,3
thanks! I was gonna go for a 100% official style but after weeks of procrastinating things go out the window lol. maybe next time,16
one of us, one of us, one of-,11
The mom is an *asshole*,17
yeah i think so, added in smoking since i thought it would look better (in an art sense) if she was holding a cigar instead of an alcohol bottle (easier to understand at a glance),15
:D,15
:),8
;—;,3
go for it!,8
:D,9
i personally dont just because aubrey did used to bully basil even if they made up later, but gotta say that the ship name bushfire is amazing lol,14
As a good old friend :3,33
And then they form a polyamorous relationship with Sunny. The End.. . Edit: and Kel.,29
she chose to care even just a little bit like an actual mom right as Aubrey is leaving ;-;,8
Prob a small part of her sort of wondering why she let things get to this point.. . Likely a small portion of her still had love for Aubrey. Often when we loose things do we realise that we actually cared.,6
Ty :) their friendship also gives me life, looking forward to drawing more,5
c h e e s e :p and spelled incorrectly lol. u dont like mascarpone??,5
thank you :) finally gonna be posting more art soon,1
[about that….](),22
i was surprised as well loll,5
thank you :),53
>!Headcanon that after months of begging, Sunny is able to have his last 6 months of high school with Basil, Aubrey and Kel again. He has to wake up an hour earlier to take the bus all the way to faraway town, but it's worth it. !<I've had this idea for a while and I'm going to draw it very soon :),213
good point, perhaps >!him and polly could sort something out with his inheritance money? and apparently basils parents are alive, they just travel a lot so maybe they own the house and not basil's grandma!<,27
The bestest ending,10
I thought it was mari-,15
I think he meant the woman with basil,24
one of us, one of us...,12
Aww good bot :),8
very good bot :D,1
ty!,8
Kel starts out not knowing what polyamory is,34
I love mascarpone! It's basically the key ingredient for the tiramisù, along with eggs,3
Whaaaat,10
# :0,41
**YES IN KEL VOICE**,25
This idea is so incredibly beautiful,13
Make a Kel meme for the last panel. We all know that makes it canon,9
pretty sure you dont need to mark spoilers on a post that already has spoilers marked on it,6
this is canon and you cant tell me otherwise,6
Yeah. I can see Polly being there for Basil and trying to arrange something.. . Basil's parents are harder to pin down. >!We never see them, or even hear that much about them. Other than paying for Polly (if I remember correctly) they don't appear to have done much or particularly seem to have been there for Basil and their mother (/mother-in-law). It's hard to know how Basil (and Grandma) would feel about them, and Basil's parents about Basil.!<. . >!I could imagine grandma leaving Basil the house and Basil's parents paying upkeep. That, or the next serious issue Sunny and friends would be dealing with is how to house/take care of Basil.!<,10
*Don't worry because at first, I thought so too--*,18
Ohhh, I see.,8
tecnoblade and omori confirmed?,5
"'Polly amory'? I mean, she's a wonderful lady, but we're kind of young for her, don't you think?",22
Seems about right.,18
>!Now we know why she hates her parents lmao!<,18
on it.. . edit: [it is finished.](),20
Ah now you’ve got me thinking about a comic idea with the gang helping basil out with the house situation… I already have too many ideas lined up to draw noooo lol. Not a bad thing though haha,8
I always to those same mistakes lol, i got ya.,3
technoboat pog,3
Amory… like… OMORI????? HOLY FUCKING SHIT,9
Lol. . Also, that explains Mr. Plantegg,14
PERFECT.,3
Could you imagine Basil having to move in with Aubrey?. . >!How would Aubrey deal with the mess? Would she apologise? Is she so used to it she doesn't notice until Basil arrives?!<. . >!Can just think of Polly, Basil and the gang ketting together to clean Aubrey's house, maybe even the delinquents help out too.!<,7
Polly x Omori,5
That sounds like there would be so much angst and you are giving me way too many ideas lol. . >!Like what if Aubrey and the gang went through the trouble to clean the house only for aubreys mom to completely disregard their hard work and mess it up immediately. And that being the last straw as for what gets her to accept basils offer to live with him!<,7
Auby. . Oof. That would hurt. Shame about the broken relationship.. . >!Would the mom get some sort of (attempted) intervention. Like, was she always neglectful (was she kind at heart or abusive)? What happened to make Aubrey's dad leave?!<. . Bagel. . >!I also wonder if Basil held any feelings of resentment towards his parents? Did the fact they're hardly ever there leave Basil with his fear of being abandoned? !<. . Even if it was for a good reason (e.g. they're massive humanitarians) it would still sting, right?,5
for auby,. . >!i always assumed that her father had passed away, and that's why the mom is the way she is. she fell into a deep depression and never got out of it. i don't think that was ever confirmed by the game though. it would make aubrey leaving her more painful too, which is why i showed the mom feeling a lil remorse!<. . for bagel,. . >!people have mentioned that the fact that he knew how to tie a noose might allude to him having a dark childhood... im sure he was super lonely. at one point in the game sunny mentions that there was a spot at their dinner table for him specifically, showing that he visited a lot ;-;!<,3
Don't the churchgoers after the church fight talk about how Aubrey's father left?,2
Sunny and Aubrey are adorable together and you can't convince me otherwise,290
Great vibe, especially Sunny,94
Omaubri?,55
wait but what if sunny wore aubrey's bow as well,54
[This is the source!]() >!(I hope this hasn't been posted already)!<,62

[deleted],385
the manic expression relived my memory of choices i indefinitely regret,365
Not even Omori has this range of expression!,156
I can see the immense amount of time and effort  it took to make each expression, so well thought out, so unique,121
before clicking: haha, cuz frisk is always -- so it’ll all be the same face, i get it already. . after clicking: yep, just as i thou—wait,42
[removed],89
one of these is not like the others,53
This is accurate,37
they're furious icon should be >:l and they're sad icon should be :v,56
missed opportunity to make miserable or furious give a shadow covering their eyes like kris' hair does-  . . . great art, by the way!,9
My favorite emotion --,14
Manic one is sus,14
Ahhh so that's why he was having a hard time hitting those slashes on sans,5
so expressive! i cant believe you were able to capture their emotions so perfectly! i applaud,7
There is one imposter among us,8
I think Chara might have slipped in there,3
I mean a thumbs up when happy and a thumbs down when sad would be a different cool concept. Still this is amazing,3
There is an imposter among us,3
"Hahaha funny joke-. . Oh. . OH.',3
"Hahaha funny joke-. . Oh. . OH.",3
turns out Chara is actually good but frisk is the fucked one. also like how frisk doesn't change expression with different emotions,3
Perfect,5
IMO the manic expression should be called "Manic?" Just to fit the actual emotion Frisk is portraying.,5
lol,3
Please the manic one 😭,3
This is the funniest version of the emotion chart I've seen,4
frisk gaming,4
This is way creepier than I imagined,2
So expressive! (On a serious note love what you did for maniac),2
That was about what I expected from Frisk.,2
Perfect,2
Perfection...just perfection,2
can relate,2
Love how Manic is the only state in which Frisk's face changes,2
*Megalo Strike Back but on violin intensyfies*,2
Do you know where the blank formate of this?,2

Very accurate,1
Manic seems… off, you should change it,1
I like how you only changed one,1

This thumbnail was how I became familiar with Omori, but I'm not brave enough to watch it because I know I'll just cry. 😭,819
There's so many degenerates in the comments that make fun of him though...,559
this video was so good, his other game reviews were good too. I love this man.,285
only for some lifeless shitbags to make fun of him for enjoying a game that made him feel related and heard.. . Bro, not everyone is going to enjoy Doom Eternal or Team Fortress 2 after a tragic moment in their lifes. Sometimes we just want to play more relaxed games to process grief easier and better.,365
. . i think this is crazy ,i feel sorry for the author.,165
I found this video a couple days after my 16 yo nephew took his life - 6 months ago. There was a lot of anger toward this game as my nephew was a HUGE fan, was a Basil Boy, and his parents didn’t find out he was playing the game until he completed it 3x. In the end, we don’t know what caused a perfect boy to be struggling so much with no warning signs. I found comfort in his video. I miss my boy terribly. Nothing will bring him back. Even tho answers may never come. It’s awful how much teen S is an epidemic. Breaks my heart for the loved ones left behind.,157
One of my favorite omori videos. It is actually pretty good that I recommend to watch It. I didn't know that they were getting harassed, but it's actually a good radio and you should give it a chance.,48
I watched this one night and just began sobbing. Worth it.,77
I… dont think I have the strength to watch this.,24
I literally found out about Omori because of it,18
I wouldn't call it wholesome ...,68
After this video for me it really sunk in that OMORI really isn't the game teens should be playing. Even when I played at 16, it hit me like a truck. If I was weaker or took the wrong inspiration from it, who knows where I'd be today. It's just that strong as a piece of art.,29

The father got what.. . Destroy this Earth rn I fucking can't anymore.,11
"the most wholesome video ever". . Looks inside. . . . about Suidice,55
I was playing Omori when that video came out. After finishing the game, I immediately went to watch it. One of the most memorable video I've ever watched on Youtube.,7
I watched it a while back, really caught me off guard, I was crying like crazy,5
i’m sorry HARASSED?? i saw the vid around the time it came out and was posted here and it was mostly positivity from what i can remember. can’t wrap my head around why ppl would go after something harmless like this,3
Honestly one of the best game reviews I've ever watched,5
Don't make a stairs joke. . ,3
Best game review ever,2
Watched it, good vid.,2
this was the video that introduced me to omori!,2
Stop why did just the title hit me in the heart so hard, i need to watch this rn,2
I discovered the video a while back. Literally bawled my eyes out,2
I watched this when it came out and i was crying the whole time,2
I watched this video a few months ago and this post reminded me to watch it again. thanks op,2
I wanna watch this now but I just know I'm gonna cry but should I anyways?,2
I remembered watching this a year ago. Still..some condolences for his daughter.,2
I remember watching this when it came out. God, it hit me like a freight train. I struggled with those thoughts throughout my life, but I'm alive because I didn't want to devastate my parents and furballs. . . I really hope he's doing better now. . . Slightly different note, but I just realized that he reviewed Gris and To the Moon (some of my favorite indie games) so I gotta watch them when I have a chance. Those games are beautiful.,2
Oh yeah, I watched this. Beautiful vid.,2
This video was what got me into omori, who the hell is it already a year old?!??!?!?,2
I owe this video a lot, its the reason i played omori in the first place after it almost made me cry for the first time,2
This video genuinely brought me to heavy heavy tears. Made me think of my best friend I lost 8 years ago...,2
I cried so hard with that video ,2
Dang that video sits on my Watch Later playlist for way too long.,2
Thus guy is my G.O.A.T,2
That video of the Dad still touched me so much,2
I cried,2
The video: :). . The comments: :(,2
full playthrough?,1
final damage, for fun,1
I want to watch it but im not ready to cry again ,1
Oh yeah I watched that like mid-2024 pretty nice watch ig,1
Ngl it doesn't seem like a good idea to play Omori after something likr that happened, what with the whole point being >!that Mari didn't commit suicide!< , but idk maybe it works out.,1
I hope the person contemplates their competence as a parent. Because I’d definitely question whether I’m doing the right thing if my child were feeling suicidal.,1
I think the discussion surrounding the portrayal of suicide in Omori is thought-provoking. He liked the game but also hated it for being dark. The game has content that could trigger a suicidal person but there is also focus on those around the sufferer like Kel. Who helps the person helping others? It's important to not forget about the Kels out there, instead of just focusing on the Basils and the Sunnys.,1
This video inspired me to play omori to bad i thought it wouldnt be that good and i spoiled it still cried fof an hour after i finished the game,1
Everybody talks about people who harrash the father but... I don't see anything,1
Wouldn't title it like that. . But yeah all I knew abt this was some twitter user (derogatory) tried to do a le hecking roast XD on the video,-1
[deleted],0
Bro this is the edgiest title I've ever seen on my whole life,-1
"...Turns out, she didn't commit suicide. Her death was framed by my son. Wait. I don't have a son... Then who is-",-29
I'd cry too. Omori already had me sobbing by the end, I don't need a man telling me the story of his late daughters passing on top of it. ,272
* it shines within u/Recent-Layer-8670,74
Probably from Twitter like that one guy who tried saying he was attention seeking or something along those lines,265
WAIT WHAT. . ,31
including deltarune,87
it seems like this is that literally the only takeaway people get from this video. . I just ignore those kinds of comments... the only thing they want is attention and I don't want to give it to them,2
I wanna twist that guy's balls.,70
What kind of inhuman fucking monster tells someone who lost their daughter "nobody cares", the lack of empathy here is sociopathic.,46
Bait used to be believable,6
r/youngpeopleyoutube,10
These are just rage bait bots,3
. . My honest reaction,2
Those dudes are a bad exemple of the omori community and everything about it. (I am talking about the dudes that left the hate comments),1
I’m so sorry for your loss…,24
I'm so sorry. . . I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts through my preteens (and later on). The scary thing about depression is that from the outside, it can come outta no where. You can seem like the happiest kid/person on the outside but unless they open up about it, you wouldn't guess. No one around me knew how much I struggled until I opened up about it years ago. . . Please know that you did your best. I can't imagine the pain you're going through.,7
Wholesomeness doesn’t just come from “wowza cute PUPPER DOGGO licking people BIG CHUNGUS WHOLESOMENESS 100.” . . Wholesomeness relates to promoting or conducing good moral-wellbeing. The video is about a father connecting with and better coming to terms with his daughter’s death through a game she liked. . . Wholesomeness can come out of and or be a product of bad things, too.,95
Inhavent watched it but I'd call it bitter sweet? Melancholy?,53
… opinion handled,-17
I played OMORI during the worst time of my life, when I was suicidal too. I only ever took away a message of hope from the game, and it helped me take the first steps to try and recover from my issues with maladaptive daydreaming. . . It's probably less so that OMORI encouraged anything, and more likely that they were suffering with issues already. A lot of dark media can be surprisingly comforting to people who are suffering with intense issues and make them feel less alone. I do agree though that OMORI's M rating is something that shouldn't be overlooked though.,24
The “Media literacy” tards accused him of using his daughter’s suicide to farm clout on YouTube.,9
people just decided to harass him in the comments i believe,8
Ya in the video’s comments.,1
time flies,1
the video: . . the comments: ,3
copy the link and paste it into youtube,1
OYASUMI OYAASUMII,1
Sort the comments by newest, and scroll for a bit.,9
Thankfully he's gotten a lot of support since really washing away the hate, but it's still there.,3
What's awful about it? It's just blunt and to the point.,4
His daughter literally killed herself, what the hell do you mean 'edgy'? He's a grieving parent who lost his daughter.,2
Don't make such jokes about shit like this, please.,1
,2
Thank you! Taking it a moment at a time! Some moments I’m inconsolably sobbing. Others I try to forget. 😔,14
Huh, didn't know that. I thought it meant something, cute, funny, heart-warming or anything that cuddles your heart, I never really bothered to search what it meant either. Thanks Stranger, I learned something new today ,10
True,7
After watching this I’m going to NEED the former.,3
idk what to call it, . . but the title being about that, I wouldn't call it wholesome,4
I wasn't able to at the moment, have already thanks,1

,1
For one, i doubt it was right after their suicide, second, you cant really sugarcoat a topic like that. Yeah its dark, but its a video dealing with a parents grief after losing their child, and he doesnt need to sugarcoat that for people who dont like him being blunt,20
,1
Basil being surrounded: oh no people ,193
Honestly my thoughts were "I love him must protect him",303
I don’t even play Omori yet I have this urge to protecc Basil ,181
Once again. I don’t really care about the sexuality of the characters and just want to be sad,106
Basil: Who said I was gay?,100
The fandom thinks so for the same reasons: is more feminine,shy and has an unhealthy attachment for Sunny. Obviously, they're all not just pointless, but are harmful, they reinforce stereotypes of gay people and in some way even the concept of toxic masculinity,298
Honestly when I first met him all I could think of was Basil the second…,20
Omori Fandom casually reinforcing harmful gay stereotypes ,229
A genuinely amazing, well-written character with a very deep personality, and people just choose to focus on "omg babil my baby femboi so cute gay babil boy",63
His just European, wtf guys.,37
,8
I headcanon everyone as bisexual.,38
I feel like if Kel looked like and talked more like Basil Suntan would be the most popular ship tbh, but despite having arguably equally important relationships with Sunny people headcannon Basil as gay because of stereotypes,18
He's not just shy, he's also generally more feminine compared to Sunny, Kel and Hero.  . Like, when some people first met him, they thought he was a girl for a reason.,94
Everything worse than I thought in here ,27
Who cares if people think he is gay or not? Let people think what they think. If you think he is straight and someone else think he is gay- what does that change in game exactly? Nothing, cause we’re just fans. So just enjoy yourselves and stop being caught up on other peoples headcanons and such,24
Bagel boy,9
Look, All I'm saying is if someone started calling me shit like "comfortable" and "perfect" i might start assuming possible romantic interest on their part,7
dont bully the femboy ,30
It's just a headcanon.,13
Every fandom has that character that they headcanon as gay, no matter what, and if you say/think otherwise, well, on reddit you might be downvoted into the shadow realm.,16
Two things can be true. You can simultaneously not ascribe vacuous "evidence" that Basil is gay just because he likes gardening while also headcanon he's gay, just because you think he's gay.. . I personally think the extent Basil went for Sunny and how he has a mental breakdown of him leaving Faraway Town tells how much Basil cares for Sunny.. . I am also not sympathetic to the notion that "thinking Basil's affection for Sunny implies homosexual attraction reinforces negative stereotypes to make the notion having friendship is gay." There are other examples of platonic relationships Sunny and Kel, Aubrey and Kim, and there's one canonical heterosexual romantic pairing with Hero and Mari, yet there's no canonical gay pairings.,13
Guys he's not gay he's just a shyguy,14
Fun fact : Basil made me gay,16
If Basil were an otherwise identical female character, people would have absolutely no problem with operating under the assumption that she had a crush on Sunny based on her actions in the story.. . . All this pearl-clutching about "stereotypes" and "male friendship" or whatever is just a smokescreen for homophobic double-standards.,28
My take: . . The good: If you want Basil to be queer/cis, so be it. If you want to show *why* you think he's queer/cis, that's okay too. That's your headcanon and you respect the opinion of anyone that disagrees with it.. . The bad: You want Basil to be queer/cis, so he *needs* to be queer/cis. "It's just a headcanon"? Miss me with that BS. Him being X because of X is a harmful stereotype.. . Conclusions: Discussing about headcanons involving sexualities can be tricky. Don't go too deep into it and you'll be fine.,4
I really didn't think anything about Basil's identity for the first 17h of gameplay. Even though he's effeminate and shy, I just accepted it as a part of his character. . . ||But then he started calling Sunny comfortable and perfect and I couldn't unsee him as a LGBT icon||,12
It literally does not matter. smoke weed or something. at least that would be more productive than arguing about a fictional characters sexuality,7
fr that was my reaction when i played it,3
Why did this turn into such a big debate? Why does it matter to you? Why do you care?,9
He can either be gay or an absolute ladies man.,5
I feel like Basil could have a pride flag in his room andthis fandom would say "It just means hes an aly",13
lmfao,2
People when they see characters with stereotypicaly feminine traits : why are you gay?,2
,2
No that’s not why lol,4
I mean sure theyre stereotypes but i feel like a lot of the gay people in this sub view him as gay, like me, so idk,4
A mind blowing plot twist: In reality it's the fandom that's gay, they were attracted to the shy boy in the first place and now they're projecting their gayness onto him.,5
no person named after a plant is completely cishet.,3
nothing wrong with being fem, he’s just a cute character and he gives queer vibes so I always associate him with that,8
I don’t like the stereotype of basil being gay ):,4
Tbh i headcanon basil to be bi,3
Let me explain why this is an issue that irks me a bit. Not this character in particular, mind you.... . If it was ever, at any point, confirmed that Basil was gay... Everybody's reaction would be "yeah, duh." Specifically because he's "queer coded". For those not in the know (just in case) queer coded simply means a character is meant to come off as obviously gay without it ever being confirmed because it's simply not relevant to the story in any way. I think it's safe to say that applies to Basil. Feminine appearance, hobbies, mannerisms, etc... (That so many people assume he's gay is proof enough he's queer coded, because his sexuality is never mentioned in the game but so many people have some to that conclusion almost to the point that's it's considered canon. It, of course, is not canon at all... but it's just kind of what the majority of people seem to go with.). . Now, yes... in an ideal world a male character could exhibit these traits and not be presumed gay. That would be amazing. I am of the opinion that men should be more in touch with their feelings. However, this is the part that irks me... that idealistic world view only ever seems to come up for queer coded characters. Because there is that non-confirmed layer of doubt, suddenly we need to start caring about "harmful" stereotypes. This is concern that only ever presents itself when it's convenient in *removing* a potentially gay character from a piece of media. It has the same energy of patting a kid on the head and saying "i know what's best, we're going to ignore your feelings and do what I want, trust me it's what's best for *you*!". . You can have your head canons, and you can leave people theirs, but when you start trying to come off like you're selflessly defending a community by erasing them from your media under the guise of (a sudden and enthusiastic interest in) progressivism that, to me, just comes off as disingenuous and... frankly, homophobic.,3
i hope basil explodes,2
I thought he was a girl when i first knew about omori🥀,1
I think in a game where subtext can be more ambigous, its better to just headcanon the characters as bi, it eases tensions too so fanwars dont happen.,-1
Both is good,1
Honestly he's cute,1
this is technically truth.,1
I think saying that basil is gay is the new reddit upvote meta ,1
My headcanon is that he's a transmasc femboy,-11
coming from a gay femboy Basil is super gay,-16
Sunny and Basil literally hold hands in the game I don't know why people act like there's no reason to assume he's gay,-4
The difference between queer omori fans and omori fans reinforcing gay stereotypes is that We understand that Everybody in omori is queer . Not just basil.,-3
Exactly! ,0
To be honest, it had to be someone.... . (Kind of like how in other fandoms, people just point at the character getting close to the mc and say they're gay... Though sometimes it is true-),0
Honestly my reasoning for seeing him as gay is completely different to the rest of the fandom, he looks like a cross between or the love child of two characters from smth else who I ship, one of them is gay & heavily associated with flowers, the other straight up looks almost exactly like his headspace design. They’re mlm obviously & bc of them, he’s my favourite character & the reason I played the game, & I see him as gay bc of the resemblance to those characters 😭😂,-5
To me also he wears a flower in his hair, he wears braclets, he wears pink like yes these things are things straight peoppe wear but all together i just domt think its wrong to say hey he might be gay,-9
If you seriously think that that boy isn't gay you need to meet people.,-2
If Basil has a ugly design like for example a chubby guy, people will ship him now?,-20
Basil is pan-,-9
[deleted],-11
They could be gay, but what if they were European?,1
Who says I am gay?,1
I have to protect him,1
Everybody:Your a bean or your gay . Me:haha kid with funny trauma couldn't be me.,1
,1
Oh look, a cute boy. Let's talk with him for no reason,84
Same,56
Prolific commenter award when you don't play omori... Do you just like the memes? The people?,68
Get out of this reddit and keep yourself away from anything related to OMORI to avoid spoilers please,43
You are gay,62
me, i did,6
The "unhealthy attachment to Sunny" excuse people use doesn't even make sense. . . Like... he... doesn't even have an unhealthy attachment? Dude even avoids hanging out with Sunny as much as he can in the three days we see him,147
Oh, you like flowers and taking photos? You must be gay then. And then some* people will accuse you of homophobic for not believing Basil is gay because you don't want to reinforce those stereotypes. (That mainly happens in Omori discord),35
Disagree. It’s not the headcanon-ers who need to change, it’s the people who actually believe all gay people are like that and believe every stereotype they see who need to change.,12
He isnt feminine though he's just a shy and timid **child** who's main hobby is gardening, I dont see why people think hes feminine at all.,9
I don’t really care about the first two reasons just the Sunny part idk what everyone else is thinking,3
He's a feminine boy that is depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend in both the game and promotional material, paired up with said friend in content that similarly pairs up the canon couple, unhealthily idolizes his best friend and even has hair that visually contrasts Sunny's, a trait common in gay characters from anime such as Evangelion and Berserk.. . Considering OMOCAT is a self-proclaimed fujoshi and has made a yaoi comic that blatantly features some of these elements, and considering her other comic's protagonist heavily inspired OMORI's protagonist, I find it hard to believe all this is a coincidence and wasn't at least a little bit intended by her.. . I'm not saying it isn't problematic to always say a feminine character is gay (Deltarune fans do this a lot even when said feminine character is not at all attracted to men and only showed attraction to a girl and an enby and it really annoys me lol), but this specific feminine character seems to be intentionally queer-coded by the author, so I'd say it's ok this time,7
it had nothing to do with the whole >!eye stabbing!< thing?,4
Casually? Nah I'm going ranked 💪,227
Omori fandom? Did you mean **every fandom these days that is remotely towards teens**,86
I mean I think he’s queer just because of his attachment to Sunny, I don’t really care about his “””feminime manners”””. + I relate to him a lot so I just automatically pretend he’s canonically queer… whoops,22
Arent a lot of the people who think it gay anyway?,3
> well-written character. . ,14
Theres a difference?,14
Average The Maverick W,27
Only characters I don't headcanon as bi or pan are Mari and Hero.,1
valid point,7
Being feminine doesn't make you gay. Genuinely frustrating stereotype ngl,176
Makes sense,6
r/OMORI everyone,12
Yeah, this fandom is a nightmare in my opinion. One of the worst I've been in. I say that as a Sonic, Undertale, TMNT, and MCYT fan.,1
The issue comes not from people saying he is gay, but from the fact that people say that he's gay because of harmful stereotypes like femininity etc...,1
OH NO MY MEDIC,3
Correction to that last statement*, there is a gay pairing in the game, though it's not explicit (it's pretty boy and jock),6
Where’s his mask then?,11
S- get down don't look at him then!,10
He's 16 ,15
you ain't lying,19
Personally I feel like people taking contention with Sunny and Basil being shipped together puts a negative stigma to same sex friendship when Sunny and Kel, and Aubrey and Kim already exist as other same sex friends is more telling. Like there are already other platonic relationships, let the gays have some fun.,17
"Pearl-clutching" describes it perfectly. . . It's also worth noting that Basil is most likely named after Basil Hallward from The Picture of Dorian Gray, a book that was on a bookshelf in the Omori demo.. . This is a quote from that character:. . >“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. ". . And looking at the entire context and plot of the novel, there are some vague similarities to Sunny and Basil's relationship. . . So no, we can't say Basil is confirmed to be gay. But it's really not a very foolish hypothesis.,9
[deleted],1
You’re spitting facts,1
most sane person here,2
1 Maybe it touches the sensitive topic. . 2 I was expected everyone to mad at me, not a debate and hates toward each other. . 3 I don't know,-1
for real, I never like when sexuality is mentioned in any sort of media. doesnt matter the orientation either, straight, gay, bi, etc. because ppl will get downvoted into oblivion and attacked no matter their headcanon. I thought in 2022 we'd be more open to headcanons but its just messy discourse,0
I'm pretty sure when OMORI takes place he wouldn't have one.... . Even then this fandom isn't *that* object to Gaysil, hell i'm sure alot of people would be either "oh okay so he *is* gay." Or "I FECKING KNEW IT!",3
It’s either that or saying feminine male characters are trans,2
,3
Whatever you want ,2
Based,2
Or maybe....we don't hc the characters as any sexuality unless there is proof in canon they have one? I feel like that'd stop wars more because what's to fight about?,0
why are you getting downvoted? i may not agree with your headcanon, but i at least respect it,2
Mfs never had friends and it shows 💀,7
Bruh this is literally  what the post was talking about. Basil should be gay based off how he interacts with guys and girls not what he wears . . Most blantant and facepalming sterotyping i've seen here yet.,13
No U. . I already done that,3
Yes because he would be more relatable,32
Noted,1
Hi I'm from the queer community, and it's absolutely harmful that the idea that Basil's necessary gay is so prevalent here. Him being more feminine and holding Sunny's hand doesn't immediately make him gay.,15
Jesse what the fuck are you talking about,11
What are you talking about?,8
>obvious queer coding,. . Bro what. . >course the straight community starts to care about harmful stereotypes when it comes to taking things away. . Bro... *what*,8
>the obvious queer coding,. . Ok if it's so obvious give examples then since we in  ``the straight community`` don't get it.,5
Average player character in RPGs,48
Yeah. Went full mother mode.,24
Idk. . I got recommended the sub awhile back and sorta got hooked,49
Who actually likes the people here?,16
I'm sure it's too late, if you spend even a day here there's nothing left to spoil,19
The circumstances are too odd and extreme to tell whether it's "unhealthy" or not but he is pretty obviously attached. He has a meltdown over Sunny moving away. Twice. Basil only seems distant because Sunny was distant for 4 years after Basil tried to contact him over and over.. . That's why he says . . >It's nice to see that you're still around... . even if it's only for a little while.. . Even before he knows Sunny is moving. He assumes he's shutting himself in again.,44
dude couldnt get over sunny not staying with him even after 3 years, pr sure thats kinda unhealthy,72
between >!covering up sunny's murder, being emotionally devastated at the news he was leaving, and all that!<. . &#x200B;. . don't you think he's just a ***\*weee*** bit clingy?,10
I admit i may be totally wrong, i thought that because >!when sunny talks to him before moving, he stated that sunny was too god for killing Mari, plus the whole stabbing Sunny's eyes part!<  . But your comments kinda changed my mind about it,1
>people will accuse you of homophobic for not believing Basil is gay because you don't want to reinforce those stereotypes. . Someone in these comments has already done that. Unfortunately it is not contained in the OMORI Discord,22
I saw that comment.... The funny part is that I'm not even straight, they were just making assumptions. And the concept of queer coding is just forced into the character,  there's no trace except what i just stated,4
[deleted],11
Liking gardening =/= feminine. Either way, using evidence of him being "feminine" as a way to put a sexuality onto him enforces harmful stereotypes.. . >depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend. . Have you mfs never had friends? Like, seriously. Hugging people you're close to and holding their hands doesn't automatically mean there must be romantic feelings involved. . >unhealthily idolizes his best friend. . He does not do this. But again, even if he did, that doesn't hint to any romantic feelings at all.. . >hair that visually contrasts Sunny's, a trait common in gay characters from anime such as Evangelion and Berserk.. . How far do you have to reach bro what. Aren't your arms hurting?. . Omocat did make both fujo and fudanshi merch, but I have not seen any evidence of herself admitting she is one. Using this as evidence for characters being gay doesn't really work when said characters show no romantic feelings for each other, and one of them is even shown to have a crush on a female character. Basil also appeared completely fine with Sunnys crush on Aubrey,7
Basically, you almost said all the stuff i already said in my first comment.. . . >He's a feminine boy. . That doesn't mean nothing, there are straight feminine boys. . . >depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend in both the game and promotional material, paired up with said friend in content that similarly pairs up the canon couple. . You never held hands with a friend of yours? Never hugged one of them? Does that mean you love them?  Plus, they're crucial to the whole premise of the game and share a trauma, it's normal to put them together in official art . . >unhealthily idolizes his best friend. . Which is not even related to romantic feelings. . . . >Considering OMOCAT is a self-proclaimed fujoshi and has made a yaoi comic that blatantly features some of these elements, and considering her other comic's protagonist heavily inspired OMORI's protagonist, I find it hard to believe all this is a coincidence and wasn't at least a little bit intended by her. . I don't understand the whole concept of indirectly saying it, i mean there are some couples and sunny is shown to have a crush for Aubrey. Plus, the fact she sold fujoshi merch in the past is not a solid evidence for it. . In the end, i have nothing against headcanons or ships, but forcing them as canon, especially when justified with stereotypes, is not a good idea,3
Nah it’s just his name is the same as a Byzantine Emperor,2
Cool username bro,27
Very true, unfortunately,13
as long as it stays a headcanon and isn't used as a fact, then it's okay,14
Having a friend of the same gender = gay. . You cannot have an attachment to a friend without having romantic motives involved . . . Okay got it, taking notes,48
Ok this is better than thinking he's gay because he's "feminine" but.... . . >+ I relate to him a lot so I just automatically pretend he’s canonically queer…. . Please don't. This is when shit gets bad in fandoms. Remember it isn't canon. . (Before anyone asks i've been in too many fandoms and have seen this pattern before with people not separating hcs from canon so i'm saying it now),34
All Europeans are gay confirmed?,6
True. I'm not saying it's good that people make him gay just because he's feminine, because it's not.,50
Yeah he is European rather than gay.,61
Preach,5
What's up with tnmt fans? They're just Ninja Turtles,1
I mean, they’re from another Omocat comic right?,4
No matter the age he still made me gay, no turning back,-5
Except that (spoilers)  >!in the game Basil stabs Sunny and not the other way around!<. . But good call,3
You're either making a strawman or missing the point I think,-4
[deleted],0
I guess, personally i just don't get why people insist that a fictional character is straight or gay or pan or bi etc, if nothing is confirmed i think everyone can have their own headcanons witgout getting mad, if you wanna hear my opinion basil seems pretty gay to me but that is my thougt,1
valid, but that takes away the freedom and creativity of individuals. u cant tell a whole collective fandom to just not headcanon, the same way I cant enforce someone or a fandom to headcanon everyone as bisexual. but i opted to at least for fandoms, to headcanon someone as bisexual since its more fluid in shipping contexts. and at least that way it doesnt take away individuals who are creative and choose to headcanon.,4
[deleted],6
Idk, I never held hands with my friends while making a speech that would sound like a love confession to most people if I was a girl,6
I get that but to me we dont get anything about Basil up front all of his character is basically based off subtle moments. Plus im also gay so like i feel like i know it when i see it. . . Plus if were going there i mean hes pretty *close* to Sunny so the way he reacta to dudes is pretty close id say. . . And also there are feminine gays. I feel like were missing that. Those are actual people. Its stereotyping but i dont think its that bad. Its not like im saying its bad if hes straight and does all this, im just saying more effeminate guys tend to be gay, again thats my experience as a gay. Plus these are fictional characters so this really shouldnt effect real life,-5
😐 😑 😐,-1
But how many? And they would re design him because they want him more 'cute' to ship?,-5
,27
I read that line as foreshadowing that Basil was going to kill himself. He gives Sunny his memory book, and he kills himself off-screen in the Hikkiomori route, so we know he was going to kill himself unless someone intervened. But your reading is valid anyways.,5
Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all,15
Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all,118
Pretty sure that's more to do with the fact he was left to hide the truth on his own and was already in the edge of suicide before Sunny came out.,58
No? . . . He was scared >!sunny would get into trouble, and did what he did to protect him!< . This doesn't come off as clingy at all. . >being emotionally devastated at the news he was leaving. . Literally a completely normal response to your close friend moving away. Especially when you and said friend are >!the only ones aware of a huge secret, and the only ones who share a connected trauma!<,25
unironically this, its like saying farmers are gay for growing plants,10
>Liking gardening =/= feminine.. . He wears a flower on his head, only declined wearing a flower crown because he said it'd be too much, and has probably the most feminine-looking hairstyle out of the main boys.. . >using evidence of him being "feminine" as a way to put a sexuality onto him enforces harmful stereotypes.. . Fair enough, I originally had the part about OMOCAT closer to that as a way to draw parallels between him and Pretty Boy but I'll get there later.. . >Have you mfs never had friends?. . No. In all seriousness, Omori seems a bit more intimate with Basil than with the others, just by looking at their Tag photos and their Release Energy animation. Holding hands is also afaik a pretty romantically-charged interaction if you're not, say, leading the person you're holding somewhere or making sure you don't get lost, and they aren't in the Boss Rush.. . >He does not do this.. . The monologue before Basil's fight says he was bullied for years because he didn't want people to think Sunny scribbled over Mari's face in the photo album, and that he created SOMETHING as a way to argue with himself that Sunny was a good person that didn't actually do those acts. Maybe the word 'idolize' was wrong and I meant something more like idealize but it's too late now lol.. . >How far do you have to reach bro. . That [is actually a thing,]() and Berserk and NGE are the main culprits. Thinking about it for a bit longer I don't think OMOCAT's intention was necessarily romantic for this specific part, though, as the contrast could just be so he stood out a bit from the rest of the cast.. . >but I have not seen any evidence of herself admitting she is one. . Ok, this part. I found like three people saying she was a self-proclaimed fujoshi but couldn't find anything about her actually doing so. She did supposedly enjoy shotacon comics in 2014, but has deleted any and all tweets relating to that so it could very well be fake. Apart from that, I sincerely believe Basil was at least slightly inspired by Pretty Boy, his earlier design had similar hair, they both have flowers as a recurring motif and they're both pretty timid. As such, a supposed fujoshi who already made a shy, pretty boy gay, making another one with a very close friendship to another male character, can raise a few rainbow flags, even if it ends up being a false alarm. . >Sunny's crush on Aubrey. . Yeah this makes me really hesitant to say I'd like Basil being gay in the base game, it'd make an unnecessary love triangle, Sunny's canon relationship with Aubrey is objectively healthier, it makes the whole stuff from the incident way worse, it's just really bad imo. I mostly ship Sunflower and hc Basil as queer when I'm thinking about kinda canon-compliant scenarios, like a post-therapy reconciliation, or actual AUs, like OMARI or a universe where nothing went wrong.. . Thanks for reading, and have a good day!,5
>You never held hands with a friend of yours? Never hugged one of them?. . Not unless I was really intimate with them or it was a really special circumstance, no.. . >sunny is shown to have a crush for Aubrey. . Oh yea fair enough. . >Plus, the fact she sold fujoshi merch in the past is not a solid evidence for it. . Yeah the places where I saw people say she was a self-proclaimed fujoshi did not list ANY sources for that claimm and she vehemently denied it when asked about it, I should've looked deeper into it, mb. . >i have nothing against headcanons or ships. . Cool, I don't think a gay basil could actually work in the base game without at least altering a few scenes, so I don't actually think it's canon, at best it's a headcanon without that many things that directly contradict it. It seems this discussion was madde out of a complete misunderstanding, and as such I'm really sorry!,1

Likewise,19
Well I’ve always felt that they were more than friends, but it’s my perception! Maybe you see them differently, and it’s totally fine and valid. I didn’t say that friends loving each other = relationship, and I would never believe that,9
There's a whole gender thing that happened in r/undertale a bit back, but in my opinion I keep it canon, and I mean, it's fictional characters? Why should it matter?,11
 I can separate headcanons from canon, my wording might have been confusing. Sorry for that,4
it really depends on the time of day,8
Why'd you say the same thing twice?,10
But look at his coiffed and crispy locks. . Look at his silk translucent socks. . There's the eternal paradox. . Look what we're seein'. . What are we seein'?. . Is he gay? (Of course he's gay!). . Or European!!?,13

Yes,1
DUDE wait are you a minor also,6
Oh shit this is my first -6 upvotes!!! Thansk guys,1
My fault, there are too much comments to read,1
English is not my first langauge,2
I guess. Honestly i have very little interest in shipping so i personally don't see a loss but i know not everyone is the same as me. After seeing many fandoms i've been in turn to shit over shipping and sexuality talk and not the damn actual content i guess i'm tired and think it'd be better to not focus on it if it wasn't in the source material.. . But like you said we can't control everything. Thinking everyone is Bi is my second option other than "lets not" so i see your point,1
maybe, but even then, when does a headcanon ever need to make sense? so long as they dont try passing it off as fact then i see no problem with it,1
It may not be a thing everyone does, but holding hands in a platonic way is completely normal. There's doesn't have to be romantic connotations.. . >making a speech that would sound like a love confession. . This never happened,2
You feel like you know it when you see it because you’re better at pointing out gay stereotypes. I think that it’s fine to do this, because I feel like those stereotypes tend to be more true when it comes to gay people, but it’s not okay to say that someone is definitely gay because of them and they shouldn’t be considered as such.,5
Many unattractive people would compare themselves to him and ship him with others.  . Maybe some would redesign him, but I can't say for sure. Like, how many people redesigned ugly characters to ship them with others?,9
I'm not arguing against that, just saying this. . >Dude even avoids hanging out with Sunny as much as he can in the three days we see him. . doesn't really prove it's not an unhealthy attachment.,2
aha good point,27
>Basil was already in the edge of suicide before Sunny came out. . Very fitting with the topic of the post,42
ok good point i see the reasoning,11
>!I request you watch [this scene]() again and come back to me saying it’s not unhealthy in the slightest bit!<,6

Man I just turned 13 this year,-2
Happens to the best of us, hope I didn't sound too agressive,0
Ah, then let me explain: It's not that Basil "acts like a girl." It's that he acts like he acts caring and attached to Sunny. If Basil *were* a girl, no one would have a problem with fans calling it a crush.. . . Think about this: Aubrey gets flustered talking to Sunny only one time, but people don't complain that Sunburn shippers are "reading too much into it." They only do it for the gay ship. What do you call that except homophobia?,10
yea im with u, even as someone who identifies within lgbtq i dont rlly care abt sexuality debates or shipwars. (unless the media was focused SPECIFICALLY on a characters sexuality or their romantic interactions, which Omori isnt lmao). I personally loved omori for its idea and concept and the game itself, so shipping also wasnt a big focus for me when I played, it was probably the last thing i even thought about.,1
“Let’s make some new memories together” while holding hands. . . If it was a girl, we wouldn’t be having this discussion,4
Yeah i also dont think hes 100% confirmed gay either these are not all gay people have of course. Mostly just my HC,-1
Very little,-2
If it was an unhealthy attachment, he would be jumping at the opportunity to hang out with Sunny as much as possible, would he not?,2
Godammit I knew that wording was gonna get called out,25
☠,7
It's not unhealthy dude. Maybe unhealthy in other ways, but not in attachment. You're literally trying to say a 16 year old having some sort of anxiety attack while he's >!contemplating suicide!< has an unhealthy attachment to a friend of his who he found out just a day ago is moving away,11
Of course not, I agree it's a very odd way of thinking on Basil's part. But nonetheless, it makes no sense to use that as evidence of him being "clingy", or having an "unhealthy attachment",2
Didn't they literally kiss in the manga? And isn't the Whole Thing that Kaworu gave Shinji unconditional love as a way to manipulate him? And don't they share a bed? Also did you actually read the source that I gave there? Because it thoroughly explains the JAPANESE tendency of pairing black and white haired boys up. . Also Shinji literally has daddy issues of course he's gay/s,2
I could explain my reasoning but it would be worthless: I wouldn’t change your mind about it. I just stand by my harmless opinion and don’t annoy anyone who thinks differently. I just shared my thoughts and if you think they’re dumb or senseless it’s completely fine, just don’t try and take down my views on a fictional character of a videogame. Have a wonderful day,6
Is he gay or European?. . Sunny: "Well hey don't look at me!",2
Never heard of it. Why is it so bad?,1
Hmmm... According to my calculations, your account is eligible for a ban! Since you turned 13 this year, and your account was made *over* a year ago, it is safe to say that you made an account when you were 12 years old, which goes against Reddit's TOS! 🤓,7
Oh... phew,4
cotton candy shipper are complain about Sunburn. That's all I can say,5
I don't see anyone hating on Suntan, a pretty popular ship between Sunny and Kel. . But I do agree with you to an extent,1
...yeah, it's almost as if Basil is saying he wants to move past the trauma, and fix things to create new happy memories. It especially means a lot to Basil since he talks about how he cherishes his memories, and takes photos of what he's scared to lose.. . . Not to mention they are 12 in this scene, and I believe it's heavily implied it's after the incident. Holding hands could very easily be a sign of comfort, and again, they are 12 and Sunny very obviously has a crush on Aubrey.. . . If it was the other way around, and Sunny and Aubrey were holding hands while it was confirmed Sunny has a crush on Basil? Yeah, my stance would be the same as it is now. It would be Sunny and Aubrey holding hands platonically, and most likely for comfort,2
Ugly bastard tag has a word with you.,4
>!Gonna quote one of your earlier comments to make a point here.!<. . >>!Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all!<. . >!Taking a bit of a shot in the dark here but "understandable" and "unhealthy" can coexist. You write it like the fact that it's an understandable reaction considering the circumstances(and it is) negates that.!<. . >!The dialogue when Sunny tries to leave Basil's room seems proof enough: "Where are you going!? Stop trying to leave me! S-Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!" ... "No... You wouldn't leave me. That's not like you, Sunny! It's something behind you again, isn't it?"!<. . I'm not saying this isn't understandable given all the circumstances. But it isn't a *healthy level of attachment.*,7
[removed],1
Can't have accounts on internet 🤦🤦🤦,0
Did you still realize that Basil made me gay?,-5
Well, I messed up my question,2
Of course they can, but I moreso meant it as he had a reason for acting the way he did, and it very clearly didn't have anything to do with him bring clingy or having an unhealthy attachment. . . He was very clearly having some sort of breakdown or anxiety attack. After finally seeing a friend after 4 years only for them to leave so soon when you have a deeply shared trauma and understanding, his reaction is warranted and has nothing to do with being clingy,2
>I doubt it it considering both the director, the voice actor, and the entire studio have rejected the idea at every turn. . Actually looked into it because you so gracefully left no sources- Shinji's VA apparently denied the show, but Asuka and Rei's have gone on record comparing the two to Ichigo and Orihime as seen [here,]()  and Anno Fucking Hideki has gone on interview with JUNE, a Yaoi magazine, discussing NGE's end and describing Kaworu's actions as seductive and homoerotic, as seen [here.]() . . >If the pairing is in your head then the source isn't really relevant.. . I mean, one can influence others (which was my original point btw) without the clear intention of doing so, there have definitely been gay stories inspired by the likes of Naruto and Sasuke despite Kishimoto's very clear aversion to the ship. Even if it's not necessarily romantic, the concept of visual contrast on hair in very close same-gender friends might have been popularized in anime by NGE, as Kaworu and Shin are undoubtedly intimate and the work's success may have lead other mangaka and anime artists to create similar dynamics. . I have more points that I want to make but I'm tired as fuck rn and they'll come out even more disorganized than the mess above, hope you can actually understand it,2
Okay...and?,5
[removed],1
Average Omori fandom discussion,3
Ok, I'll start by saying something I think I should've said a long time ago: Word of God is not the trump card you think it is. Cast members often have opinions that differ from the canon and from eachother, *especially* when it comes to shipping and even more when said ship is a gay one from the 90s. It's called "Death of the Author", and it's a really important concept in literary analysis, as it allows new meanings to come from media without them being necessarily the author's intent.. . That being said, let's run through some of these points of yours. . >So, the director, the mangaka, and the voice actor for the character say no, but two other random voice actors say yes.. . As you said, the Manga is not a primary source, so its writer shouldn't be considered, the VA for the character has no say in the story at all, so their opinion holds as much weight as every other VA, and as to the director? We'll get to him.. . >The interview you linked he literally says there's no carnal desires involved:. . Your quote was taken out of context. That is specifically talking about Shinji initially blushing when meeting Kaworu, which most likely meant he didn't feel sexual attraction at first.. . Now, here are some quotes with context:. . >Interviewer: Well then, conversely, when you seduce someone, or when you are seduced, do you think that you’d like to be told something like that? Telling someone or being told by someone, “Your heart is like glass,”—did anything like that actually happen to you?. . >Anno: Nope, nothing like that.. . Here we have Anno not disagreeing with the claim that Kaworu was seducing Shinji. . >Interviewer: You said previously that that sort of JUNE-like, or should I say the sort of production that goes beyond friendship, came out that way naturally, didn’t you?. . June is a yaoi magazine, so here we have the director saying the relationship was yaoi-like.. . >Anno: A person named Satsukawa (Akio)-san did [the original script]. Satsukawa-san is better at—this is bad to say, but—he’s right on the mark when it comes to homoeroticism. *laughs*. . LITERALLY SAYING THERE WAS HOMOEROTICISM. He later says he toned it down a bit because the scenes were too homoerotic, but the fact that someone was tasked with writing the script in such a way means it was part of the plan.. . >Let me ask you this, why do you think on the re-release of the series on netflix, the studio took the translation into its own hands and changed the subbing?. . [Because the translator wanted it to be infered by the audience instead of said to them]() (also the word originally used in Japanese can mean either like or love, the meaning is purposefully ambiguous and I'm pretty sure they could've picked a word that was purely meant as 'like' if they really wanted to).. . >And I looked it up, you said that they "literally kiss" in the manga, but the mangaka has gone out and said that they aren't in love either.. . "Sure, they kiss and make out and get married and have three children but the definitely not homophobic producers said it was nothing!" That's what you sound like. . . I just read that scene, and while the "kiss" isn't exactly a kiss per se (Kaworu "did CPR" on a hyperventilating Shinji), the outcome of it is Shinji being a blushing mess while Kaworu asks several invasive questions about kissing and love. Shinji says he hates him and two boys shouldn't fall in love,  though, so it'd make sense for the mangaka to say there was nothing there, and as was previously established, the Manga ultimately does not matter, so I digress.. . After all that, what exactly am I getting at?. . Well, when some voice actors, the director, the translator, a screenwriter, [an editor]() and most importantly the canon itself seem favourable to the ship, it's not fucking "tumblr fujo fanfiction", it's a canon-implied pairing and should be treated as such. Have a good night, sir.,2

What about Sunnys mom! She's nice... I believe :),22
Sunny's mim leave him with everything he needed, he probably could cook the steak, and he is 16, in anyone's mind, he could ask for delivery food. There is no way Sunny's mother knew the amount of depression that was going on, expecially because, considering the way she treats him in the phone calls, he wasn't all that depressed arround her. Also, he clearly loves her and we can see that in the truth segment,6

Sunny's Mom doesn't "fucking suck." I mean, she might not be the best mom, but I certainly wouldn't lump her in with Basil's parents, Aubrey's parents, or Hero/Kel's parents. . . oh wait this is a meme why am i taking it seriously-,2
Kels dad is pretty good,2
Sunny: Dad isn't bad, he was just pressured into the ground. Mom is trying her best.. Kel: parents r good. Aubrey: Mom left. I don't really know about her dad. Hero: brother of kel,1
I like how the "best" parents out of the friend group are hero and kel's and they aren't even good.. . They are definitely below the bar of what would be considered good parenting, but compared to:. . Complete and utter abandonment from Basil's parents. . Abandoned by ther dad and stuck with her alcoholic mother for Aubrey. . And just how BADLY sunny's parents handled the circumstances around Mari's death . . That's just acceptable at this point,1

She had to leave at some point to prepare to move. With Sunny being in no apparent condition to talk to strangers the only option was to just leave him home I guess,60

Honestly? My issue with Kel and Hero's parents is probably too biased to be a fair judgment simply because my own childhood and current-adulthood is...rife with a certain type of parent. And Kel and Hero's Mom reminds me too much of my own. Not even in the Favoritism sense, but in a different scene. So! I don't argue with people on it because I could just be coloring the text with my own lenses, you know? Better be safe than sorry on things I don't have concrete evidence for, like tone and body language.,60
Favoritism. They treat Hero much better and ignore Kel.,51
They are better than most omori parents but they do have slight favoritism towards hero (though even that is excusable because the scene where it was implied Hero had been in a deep depression for several weeks),22
Not much honestly its just fanbase blowing stuff out of proportion.. . It aint their fault kel has no awards or trophies.. . Hero has been gone to college for a while so of course they want to see him and act a bit clingny.. . Of course they priortise hero when he was depressed likely bding scared he would kill himself.. . Are they perfect? No. Is hero favored to an extent? Yeah probably.. . Do they still love both their kids and just wish the best for them even if they aint perfect ib their approach? Yeah probably,11

Tbh I kinda thought they were pretty bad too. Not to the level of Sunny, Aubrey and Basil’s parents, but they always gave Hero more attention and when Hero returned to visit, the mom sorta guilt tripped him iirc?,12
Disagree. Acceptable? Sure, above average? Maybe.. . Fine? Fuck no lol.,-5
My theory is that he suspected that Sunny killed Mari, and extricated himself from the situation because he believed he might harm or kill his own son. Obviously not world's number #1 dad, but considering how bad it could have gotten, leaving may have been his only option.,6
She's embarrassed! Or at least I think she is?,14
[removed],1
I am sorry to say it Coffee person. . But no amount of being nice changes the fact that is it generally advised against leaving your shut-in son unsupervised for 3 days. . especially when it's obvious to anyone with eyes that it has to do with tragic loss,50
nah there’s no way. You don’t let a kid hole himself up in his house, not going to school, for FOUR years and not know that something is horribly wrong. I think she is talking to him like that on the phone because she’s treating him like a twelve year old who hasn’t changed or matured at all. I’m not sure if she knows the truth but it’s implied.,3
[deleted],8
>You're putting way too much reliability on Sunny's POV.. . Sunny's POV is the primary view through which the story is told, we have no choice but to rely on it. If we just say that Sunny is unreliable full stop then we have no way of knowing for sure if anything we see from his POV is accurate or not. The only time we shouldn't trust Sunny is if something in the real world directly contradicts something in headspace. (for example: Kel likes milk in headspace but says he hates it in the real world). . >First off, that steak might not have been rotten, that steak wasn't even microwaved. The power was out that night.. . It was microwaved. Only the lights were out, not all the power,9

agreed,46
What exactly are canonically wrong w Sunny’s parents?,75
nah, Basil's parents are far worse than Sunny's mom. . . Sunny's mom is at least trying and clearly cares about her son, even if she isn't perfect. She's doing one of the best possible things she could do for Sunny by moving. I mean fuck, the kid literally >!represses the existence of entire rooms of the house. Everything about that house is tied to serious trauma for Sunny at this point, it's best for him to move.!< I get that her >!leaving Sunny, a suicidal kid that barely eats and hasn't been outside in 4 years, alone for 3 days was super irresponsible. She has been unintentionally facilitating Sunny's dangerous coping mechanism as well.!< I never said she was perfect, but she's at the very least trying to help him and clearly cares about him. Considering that every other main characters parents besides kel and hero's are either entirely absent or outright abusive, Sunny's mom is one of the better ones.. . Basil's parents barely even seem to care about him beyond making sure he isn't dead. They've left him with his grandma for his entire life, and don't even bother to visit him ONCE after needing to hire a caretaker for Basil after grandma's condition is too severe to look after him. Let me make this clear, Basil's parents haven't visited their child in two years, when the only parental figure in his life is slowly dying. Basil's friends were the closest thing he ever had to an actual family, because his real family had better things to do than actually take care of him. >!it's no wonder he's the clingy, lonely, self loathing, and suicidal mess he is after hanging Mari and watching his friends all leave him because of what he did.!< God I utterly despise his parents, and they aren't even the worst parents in Omori, Aubrey's mom somehow manages to be worse.,47
i mean maybe you were saying theyre the least shit but. . if youre saying kel and hero's parents are good, id heavily disagree. . with how they seem to barely care about kel, and put so much pressure on hero, its... yeah,18

I know, but she's definitely more of a parent than Basil's actual parents.,9
Now that you mention it, yeah. Albeit Basil's actual parents likely sucked as well, his Grandma wasn't really a 'parent,' she was more like a caretaker to him, kinda like Polly.,24
And more than likely dead.,10
I think I might just commission one of my two favorites of the gang in the style of the [PV.]()  Sunny or Hero. (probably Hero, because the whole. Grades motif. 「A」「D」iykyk). . But thank you for the kind words ,12
I like how code word for su!c!de is oyasumi now,7
Good bot,16
The one where she guilt trips the hell out of Hero for not wanting to be glued to her side as soon as he gets home? It made me so uncomfortable too, hit way too close to home.,56
Thank you stranger, I like your Madoka pfp,4
[The Headphones Kid](),6
somewhere in an alternate universe, this is real . . now time to cry,12
How is Kel not winning awards his parents' fault?,3
>!To be fair when the incident happened I'm pretty sure Hero was in a worse state than Kel,!< although they should still recognize Kel as a chad just like Hero,57
jesse what the fuck are you talking about,10
[deleted],8
real. (real),1
I'm not so sure it's fair to say that she absolutely knew the extent and symptoms of Sunny's mental illness. He really tries to keep that bottled up nice and tight.. . Even if she did, what other options did she have? Leave the house completely unattended?,18
OK fair. I mean there's no evidence to support she neglects him and it weird she left him.. . I'm not biased but she definitely is just a usual mom I guess. So yeah I guess I agree with the tragic loss on that one,21
>!Hes 16, she leaves notes everywhere, and who else would move the stuff when the dads out of the picture?!<,10
Nobody's saying she's perfect, but neither are any of the kids. Yet they're given 100x more sympathy than any of the parents.,2
WUAHAHAHAHAHHA CADUCED STEAK,0
Well, since she knows the truth, she obviously know what's horribly wrong, but Sunny's state was in another level. Heck, I don't think anyone could guess how bad it was except for himself, in the truth segment.. . . Also yeah, she treats him like that, but cut her some slack, sunny is the last thing she has lmao,2
If I might throw something out there, we objectively see no gifts or signs of Sunny’s mom contacting the hospital at the end, despite enough time having gone by that the entire rest of the town was able to pitch in and send get well gifts. While one can argue that they simply didn’t show it because the focus was on Sunny’s group of friends, it doesn’t change the fact that, narratively, we do not see even a mention of his mother visiting after at *least* one or two days at the hospital, during a period where we know she would’ve been there. . . For comparison’s sake, game saw fit to make clear that the random nameless shopkeeper from Fix-It wishes Sunny a good recovery, but omitted his own mother. That can’t be accidental. . . Absence of information can be just as informative as spelling things out, and the omission of Sunny’s mom at the hospital is a pretty damning example of that and tells us everything we need to know about her.,1
We are well aware,61
does that really matter when she acts more like she is than his ACTUAL parents?,44
Perhaps that's why she's good with the leaf lover boy,1
>!The fact that Sunny's dad left after Mari died, even if he knows the truth can generally be seen as a pretty scummy parenting move. As for Sunny's mom, we don't have enough information to know for sure, but the argument can be made for the possibility that she wasn't as attentive to Sunny as she should have been.!<,132
>!|Sunny's mom left her depressed teenager alone for 3 days with no food but a frozen steak.!<,164
Dad left him and it doesn’t seem (to me at least) that Sunny’s mom cares much about him.,10
Sunnys dad went to get Milk and his mom left him alone at home for three days knowing damn well he has panic attacks,6
Sunny’s mom pretended nothing was wrong and left her son alone for three days with only a rotten steak. . . Sunny’s dad just abandoned him after you know what,10
i agree. i was suprised to see sunny's mom before basil's parent's,12
Especially if you hear kel’s story about how they handled it(forgot how to use spoilers so can’t specify),2
Hey Sunny’s dad has a perfectly reasonable response to what happened. . Their about even do,7
I’d say that Basil’s parents are worse than Sunny’s mom. While she’s not a perfect mother, she is at least trying her best. (?) >!Although she did leave Sunny unsupervised, she did remain in his life, despite possibly knowing the truth. Basil’s parents are never home, which makes them extremely neglectful at best.!<,35
Yup but she's still not his mom,-2
Ohh, I dig that style! Please do share on here, if you end up pursuing it further . . And anytime!! I've always been a "wannabe artist," so to speak-- so I know all too well how harsh the self-criticism can get. And while I hate to say it... >!just look how the path of perfectionism ended up for Mari!< ,5
OH THANK FUCK someone else said it. . Yeaaah that's exactly what I'm referring to. Way too close to home and while I don't think it was intentional on OMOCAT's part....it does seem a bit 'starts witn an N' parent-y. Again! Don't think it was intentional! But that combined with some things I've read about Favoritism and my own experiences.....it doesn't exactly make me feel good about her, personally.. . But because this game is told entirely through sprites and text, we will never know exactly how all that played out, so I prefer to not debate it with others. Just turns into a neverending argument, and I've had more than enough of those for one lifetime :'),23

The post text,1
Yes, he definitely was, but they should definitely recognise KEL as the chad he is,26
Its not just that incident, its from other stuff too. >!The house is full of awards, none of which are kels (not counting participation as an award). Kel tries to avoid his parents like 3 times iirc. Kels mom yells at him but thanks hero.!< Not to mention [this](),54
I mean didnt Kel say that they kind of forgot about him even though he was greiving too, snd that's why he had to get through it by himself? Its not like he wasnt hurt; he also avoided Mari's grave for 4 years until Sunny gathered everybody,1
real. (real),1
Yes, he keeps it bottled up, but he still isn't leaving the house on his own, is he? If Sunny used to go outside before Mari's passing, and doesn't go outside like he did before, post-Mari's passing, what other conclusion could you draw other than mental illness?. . Unironically yes? It sucks if a house gets broken into but in the case of a break-in, I would much rather have my child with me and lose some material possessions instead of shot dead by a robber. Or, you know. Potentially offing himself like my daughter supposedly did.,14
? The lack of supervision in and of itself is considered a [type of neglect.]() Now, that's the law in my state. I don't know what US state Faraway Town is supposed to emulate, but this is the rubric by which I am viewing the situation. Sunny might be older but his circumstances certainly put the question of supervision neglect into question.. . Also, it's worth mentioning, that parents don't always intend for neglect to happen. But that doesn't change that it does happen, separate from their feelings and intentions towards their child.,11
>!My man... Im pretty sure, she justs wants to get away from sunny as much as possible, most of her phone calls sounds like excuses. And some of the only food she left hin with, is expired stake. There's a reason why sunny looks so close to his younger self(omori) and thats cause he is heavily malnourished. And he fact that he obviously hadnt have any sort of therapy(from what we can see) are some proof i found of child neglect!<,6
She leaves him raw steak, and he doesn’t know how to cook it properly,2
Correct me of my memory is wrong, because I admit my memory could be wrong and I don't feel like scouring youtube for screenshots but. . >!That's not actually the reason she's away for 3 days straight? If it was one day and she comes back that's fine but I think the reason she gave on the phone was something about a sale...? I don't consider that a good reason to leave my kid alone for 3 days straight, even with notes and answering machine messages. It doesn't take 3 days straight to get the new house ready, does it? Genuinely asking, I have never had to move as an adult before.!<,7
Dear internet stranger.. . I understand your plight. Really, I do. Being an adult woman/man myself, I get that a lot of people in this fandom don't care to think about the more adult characters more deeply. Seeing as a lot of this fandom are teenagers. Combine that with the fact that we don't really get Sunny's Mom's point of view, makes it really hard to sympathize. I get it.. . But I'm not saying these things maliciously. And that might seem hard to believe from my other comments. But the truth is, I want, more than anything, for someone to write something for the parents. I want them to become multidimensional characters with flaws and mistakes and lessons to learn and part of that is outright saying: "your actions here fucking sucked, especially when you are an adult with a child depending on you". . I feel like the best way to get that is to start with pointing out where the problems are. I'm certain that Sunny's Mom is actually quite a lovely person. Probably quite good company, based on how nice her notes are. But being good company doesn't always mean being a good parent, and that's something I hope she works on in the future with Sunny.. . Does that make any sense? I want drama, I want healing, I want it to come clean and be honest...for example from another franchise, Rosa Ushiromiya and her daughter Maria. That sort of thing, if those two characters mean anything to you.,6
it just sucks, because she’s the only one who could possibly begin to understand him since she knows what really happened. He either needed some tough love by making him at least leave the house or go to school, and/or some professional help. but instead she lets him just keep existing in a sorry state and lose out on some of the most important years of young adulthood, hence the part where she acts like he’s a kid still. i mean, i sympathize because he is a danger to himself and she doesn’t want to set him off or mess him up worse, but her behavior is not making anything better and ultimately she is still responsible for him,1
She also gave him 20 bucks, so that he could order some food. He probably wouldn't even need to go outside, just order it over the phone.. . Being a single parent isn't easy dude.,184
You're putting way too much reliability on Sunny's POV.. . First off, that steak might not have been rotten, that steak wasn't even microwaved. The power was out that night.. . Second, we can't judge a character purely based off of one time we see them, especially in Black Space of all places.,61
I think abandoning your family is a pretty selfish thing to do,52
>!Mari commits dead (they probably don't know the truth), and instead of being there to help his son get his life together he just leaves. I mean, Sunny's dad would be happier, but still pretty scummy!<,18
That... isn't exactly an answer to the question ,9
Aren’t basil’s parents dead? I thought I read that somewhere on the wiki.,5
She’s not his mother, but she is his mom.,4
Oh totally understandable, no worries! I super relate, there's peace in knowing when/how to choose your battles . . Definitely feel you on The Word™️ though lol, the dishes agreement thing was so real. I've done the same thing for my SG little sibling, the GC privilege comes in handy sometimes even if it comes with constant N smothering 🙃,6
[Here](),1
true,3
I mean... He didn't win awards, that's not his parents fault.,17
to be fair this game is set in the 1980’s when most people would just let their 7 year old kids roam outside with no supervision. plus, in the early 1980’s mental health was extremely neglected to a point where some people didn’t even know what depression, ptsd, or anxiety even was. with all the factors of this i think that sunnys mom was sorta justified to leave the kid alone,5
The problem with this is its up to interpretation, we haven't seen her so we don't know her entire personality. She could've been avoiding him purposely or not, we don't know. We know her husband left and Mari died and took a toll on everyone.. . The issue arrives with the moving, why would she pick up Sunny for moving if she was avoiding him?. . Also it was never confirmed she left him around the break since Maris death, at least in some way. I dunno why a kid could even keep a house and pay the bills,22
>!I think the sale thing is right, but she wouldnt be at the store for 3 days lol. If the new house is several hours away, itd be better to just stay for a few days when setting it up!<,13
Plus leaving a child with raw steak who doesn’t know how to cook it!,-1
Aight.,1
Implying sunny goes outside or uses the phone. If you have a mentally I’ll child at home who you know hasn’t gone outside in 4 years and presumably not used the phone at that time why would you just leave them at home with 20 dollars under the assumption they’ll get food themself. I’m no way is Sunny’s mom the second worst parent in the entire game and I believe she gets way too much flack and no one said being a single parent was easy but the food situation specifically was dumb.,123
bruh she let the electricity go out on her teenage son like 💀💀💀,13
Bro I'm sorry can you order 3 days of food with a 20?,20
We keep going over this - the power *isn't* out. The fridge lights are on, the microwave runs, Sunny can use his answering machine, and his computer. The power to the LIGHTS are out. General electricity was not. In plenty of suburban neighborhoods the lights are separate from outlet power.,26
The power was out, so he couldn't cook the steak... but the power thing was the mom's fault, and she should have realized that he wouldn't be able to prepare the food she left him if there was no power. Besides, even best case scenario in which the power wasn't out, is a steak and 20 dollars enough to hold him over until she got back?,3
>!”Stay away... You are not my son...” it’s unclear if that quote ever happened or if Sunny imagined it, Blackspace and all, but if it’s a real quote then Sunny’s dad probably knew the truth.!<,30
no, their alive. their quote on quote, “too busy” or smth. Looking at the source for the wiki saying that theres a quote from polly.. . Polly: BASIL's lived with his grandma since he was a toddler. His parents always seem to be too busy... I've only ever seen them once.,16
Omgggggg yeah I- My situation is a bit different because I had it the other way around. I'm the youngest, the baby, but I was always the more academically interested/""gifted"" kid. Along with being the only one born female, it made her coddle me in ways she didn't do to my older brothers....but now we're essentially trapped in the same house together, neither of us pull our metaphorical punches, and we have mutual hatred so I went from being GC to SG 🙃. . That scene made me so uncomfortable, I was just yelling "yOU'RE A GROWN MAN, YOU'VE MOVED OUT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A DAMN THING ",7
I mean they put em on the fireplace and stuff too which just rubs it in lol,2
....isn't this set in the 90s tho? I could’ve sworn everyone mutually agreed on the 90s because of the gameboy Sunny has and the fact that Hero is mentioned to be born 199X in the Last Resort (i think),14
... because they were moving. Duh.. . **Credits roll**. . But seriously. I have no real idea, that was just my own little theory with evidence. But yes, you're correct. . Heres my thoery but its a bit of a stretch >!so sunny's dad might've knew that sunny was the cause of mari's death, maybe. And of course, it wouldnt be farfetched to day he either told the mom, or he himself told her. We also know sunny's mom said something along the lines of "you are my only child left, i dont wanna lose you too". So, maybe the dad suggests that him and the mom should just leave ssunny, but the mom disagree. Which leads to their inevitable divorce. And that causes the mon to go over the edge, but not completely. While she still brings him food, she cant stand to look at him because he lost her to lose 2 of the people she loves. But in contrast, he's the only one left, so she tries to take care of him as much as possible!<. . I know its preety dumb. But im no psychologist,2
who says he doesn't know how to cook it?. . Also it was already cooked and then refrigerated, it wasn't completely raw,9
Sunny’s mom - within the fictional context of the game so far as it goes - probably knows well enough if Sunny is capable of using 20 dollars to order food or not.,64
20-30 years ago yes you could,30
if you were a "gifted" kid you may also relate on how hero's parents wishes for him to be a doctor without questioning him even when he wants to be a cook. i bet hero, the people pleaser he is goes along with it because of the pressure,6
It was the opposite for me during that scene actually aha, my siblings and I are 23/16/6 with me being the oldest so I was skeeved out by their mom being Like That, but I was just sighing and nodding along with Hero the whole time lmfao. I've had my fair share of "yes, ma, I'll be your coparent next time I see you, just lemme take the SG out for a fun day and then you can have all my attention when we get home" negotiations over the years. It's a fine line you have to walk, figuring out how to balance the "SG deserves nothing" and "GC has to get what they want" in your N's brain so you can actually give the kid a day of freedom. . . Moving out actually gives you so much more pull too, I was never allowed to take my little sibling farther than the corner store when we were both living at home because "they'll cause too much trouble out and about!!" but now that I've moved out, I can leverage time with me to get permission to take my sibling anywhere I want. We have sleepovers at least once a month and I got to take them to Pride a state away earlier this month :) and all it cost was a few hours of gardening with Nmom. . It sucks and it makes me feel manipulative sometimes but I tell myself it's okay because it gets SG out of the house for a little while 🙃 sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire yknow? It's for a good cause :p. . Sorry for rambling lol it's so easy to infodump about N dynamics, tldr Hero girlboss moment and I love it for him,5
i vividly remember seeing 198X on kels wall and the last resort painting or i’m going insane, i’m gonna load up my game and check. . edit: dude what the fuck i just checked and it said 199X i swear it was 198X i’m losing my mind,7
He MICROWAVED IT,1
Then he would have done it. From the 4 years he’s stayed at home she would know he’s not gonna leave💀,28
You really are a good sibling  unfortunately for me, nothing like mine!. . And it's okay I actually trimmed that message down because I almost rambled about my own N dynamics ,6
Well yeah, probably because it was already cooked and it just needed to be reheated,2
Sunny’s obviously at a bit of a turning point with his depression by the time we meet him in the game. Is it really that hard to believe he’d been capable of calling in a pizza or something before the game’s events and that his mom knew as much?,31
Then why, tell me, did he get so sick from it his vision wobbled?,1
Yes. Have you played the game? He was basically nonverbal and absolutely not willingly to talk to or interact with strangers,12
He’s not really at a turning point at the start of the game. He only started getting better after opening the door for kel. And if he could speak to order pizza then he would have spoken to his friends when he left the house. The only time we see him speak is at the end of the game,11
Idk probably because he ate old reheated steak at 3am,0
Guys... Are we really arguing about whether a video game character would order a pizza after being in his house for 4 years... Im in, my bets are on he wouldn't be able to,4
Counterpoint, he fucking *screams* PIZZA DELIVERY. It seems pizza is the exception to his depression.,2
And his mom simply trusted him with it? A 14-16 yo boy,1
I wonder if that was an oversight by Omocat considering that doesn’t fit his personality at all lol. Or maybe it was supposed to be an ironic joke.,1
Sunny is 16, and idk about you but when I was 16 I could definitely reheat a steak in the microwave. Even when I was 14 I did that,2
I feel like he just takes his jobs very seriously,3

The mental image of Mari bursting into Sunny's classroom just to scoop him into her arms and whisk him off to Dairy Queen is actually really sweet, lol.. . The next tweet is them eating ice cream, followed by Mari doing donuts in front of DQ with Sunny cheering in the passenger's seat.,11
There was a pizza party that's why.,6

Omori is relatable (kinda? not in the sense that you're probably thinking),397
I relate to The Maverick. . ,242
I relate to the no parents part 😁,334
i relate to not going outside since 2011 🤠,447
I like pushing people though,101
I somewhat relate to it, but not a kind where >!"I killed somebody by pushing them down the stairs"!<  but the kind where I have this bubble of isolation a small circle of safe zone which I rather spend time in that than facing reality.   . Again it’s not as severe as Sunny, but the feeling he feel are sometimes familiar.,255
those who relate to omori don't relate to it literally, depression is a pretty widespread issue in modern society so many people will (figurativly) find themselves in the game and really resonate with Sunny's problems,201
I relate to Auby. . No father? Check. . Is racist? Check. . Bullies children? Check,132
I relate to being lonely to a crippling degree and having no one to help you through it and using escapism and day dream fantasies to try and forget about it /srs,41
I relate to OmoriBoy,37
I uh- I kind of can. I accidentally made my mum >!fall down the stairs (she tripped over my bag when she was running down & I didn’t have enough time to move it before she got to it)!<. She’s okay. It was New Year 2019-2020. She broke her foot & had to get surgery, she has a metal plate now, but she doesn’t blame me, she did in the moment but the day after it happened after she calmed down she realised it was partially also her fault for running & not giving me a chance to move my bag. I can confirm that like >!Sunny, the situation is scary & you panic. Rational thinking goes away lol I just ran upstairs & cried for an hour, I had no incentive to think “I should check she’s okay” or “someone call 999”,!< it was just fight or flight. Obviously my situation is significantly less bad, but it was a horrible situation none the less & I do understand why >!Sunny & Basil!< acted the way they did in the scene. I was 15 at the time btw, so I was even older than they were 😅,64
>!Did you accidentally kill your sister too?!!<,28
I relate to sunny and or omori, aswell as Basil. But it's a pretty relatable game I think? Minus some things but a lot of people can relate to either of them or any character. Atleast I think so haha,28
I relate to Sunny wanting to stay in his dreams and not face reality,25
I relate to the part where I don't come out of my house since 2018 and the part that I have a very fertile imagination full of silly things,20
I know no one here (openly) relates to what the post is insinuating but based on how many copies the game sold >!how possible is it that someone out there who accidentally killed their sibling bought the game?!<,18
I relate to Sunny a bit cus of the whole imagining epic adventures with a non-existent group of friends.   . Oh...also, my sister is learning to play the piano...and she has >!a black cat...and I live in a two story house!<,18
My ass who relates to almost the entire cast: ,32
 <--- this guy? Oh god...,15
I relate to Basil,14
Hah.. . oh I relate.. . Just not to the >!manslaughtering your sister and sleeping all day!<parts.. . But Basil's anxiety, Sunny's imagination/personality, trauma generally, 'regular' loss, loss of friendship and general happiness.. Kid Aubrey a lil, Kel’s funny(lol), Mari’s wisdom, Hero’s people pleasing(except not the actual charming/pleasing people that he does)..,13
I find Omori very relatable ,10
You can relate to certain aspects of it without relating to the whole.,13
i relate to the violin part and to the escaping reality to fantasy world part 🥲✌️,22
Guilt is relatable even if it’s not to this insane degree.,11
i relate to the crippling depression and loneliness,11
I relate to Kel. . ,9
I can relate to the visualisation of trauma. So yeah xD,5
I mean you can find Omori relatable. I found several parts of Sunny's personality kinda relatabke. Especially Sunny's want to just not have feelings. Several other things are kinda relatable as well, not as a whole, but enough bits and pecies to make it feel relatable.,6
>!okay buddy, where did you hide the body!?!<,5
I relate to the loneliness,6
I deal with depression and maladaptive daydreaming so I find it relatable on those aspects. Also the >! Final fight against Omori and he starts telling Sunny all those horrible things !< Though, no, I’m not dealing with >! The guilt of killing my sister !< I still find the imagery in the game relatable. The Something’s and “something behind you” is how I’ve always imagined my mental illness and intrusive thoughts. Playing Omori and the imagery within it was like watching my own mental health through a looking glass and made me realize that I… really need therapy ,7
My older sister is lucky there are no stairs at our house,5
i relate to the no friends part & the living inside my own imagination part & the feeling of slowly fading away because no one remembers me part😝😝😝,3
I mean I did go Hikkikomori for a while there so I relate to that.,7
I found it relatable in some minor ways. Mostly the isolation part. I can proudly say, though, I've never >!pushed anyone down the stairs!<,6
Except for the reason for isolation, I have gone through something incredibly similar to the narrative of the game,4
i relate to sunny in pretty much everything (when i first played the game at least), minus the >!murder!< and the going outside to talk to people and get jobs,5
>!Relatable in some ways but not in a kill your sister way!<,4
Except for the incident it’s very relatable to me, that’s why it hits so hard. Main difference being I never had a good childhood or true friends like sunny did, although I wish that were the case.,5
playing omori i was so shocked at how much i relate to sunny :,) >!but hey, at least i haven’t killed anyone yet!<,6
maladaptive daydreaming gang where y’all at,4
The only thing I relate to in that game is the overuse of escapism,4
can't relate to >!accidentally killing my sister!< but the words that the final boss said were very relatable,2
I relate to the shut in part and rhe dreams of wishing things were okay,4
I relate to missing childhood 😓,5
I relate having friends :),3
Relating to some of the emotions the game shows is fine. relating to the events? Now that’s something to be worried about,3
Lit's of people relate to it. Not because of YOU KNOW WHAT but because of other things.,3
I relate trying to lock my self in a dream world named after a color then space (green space) from where you can access other dream world throught door two are three years ago.  But I don't sleep enought to suceed.,3
I pretty much related to it since Covid was a thing.,3
I think the story itself is not relatable because it's kind of a specific situation but I think the way the characters specially Sunny deal with the situation is kind of relatable ( for me tbh ). The way sunny isolated himself from the whole world after that situation until the guilt "decorated" him inside is something I do,3
Omori is the game that I relate the most.. . I don’t go outside I’ve lost all my friends I have depression and I love anime manga (like you know the basic hikikomori) many people are hiki so yeah…. . Also I have trauma and they are ruining my life.,3
i found Omori relatable in mid-2021 like i just spiralled into depression EVEN deeper because i did something very horrible to someone i love so much like Sunny. i guess i learned it the hard way, but when i got a job it got better then bad again because of my monster of a boss asking me to help him do something similar 🤢 like dude's asking a young woman to help him do something bad wth. i would never go back there. also if you guys want more details just ask because I'll probably comment it here,3
I relate to small parts of each character. . The way >!omori talks to sunny!< is something I've felt, >!aubrey's home life!< reminds me of something I dealt with when I was younger, >!Basil's fear of change/being alone,!< I don't relate to it literally but it feels almost inspired by someone similar to me and it's kind of a good feeling to know that,3
Only way i relate is by having a reoccurring dream every single easter day that picks up from the last dream for the past 9 years,3
I relate to disassociating from the real world to avoid dealing with my problems,3
i'm an older sister who plays piano,3
I can relate a bit. I have a bigger sister and I love her to death she is my favorite person ever >!, If she were to die rn I wouldn't kill myself because that is not what she would have wanted but I'd be an empty husk.!<. . >!If I was responsable for her death I couldn't live with myself. I know that if it was the same scenario she would want for me to forgive myself but I don't think I could. Probably getting the bad ending irl if that ever happened.!<,3
I mean relation can be anywhere on the spectrum from “I’m introverted, shy, and like to think about my ideal concept of friends because real ones are complicated,” to “I am consistently in and out of the hospital and struggle to live because my mind keeps attacking itself.”,3
It was relatable to me unless until I know the reason why he's isolated,2
I relate,2
Me but with cry of fear. Like I shouldn’t be a near one to one copy of Simon please help,2
……I relate to Omori 😬. . (or at least I used to. Brings up lots of memories of my childhood),2
I think omori has a character everyone can relate to in some way lol,2
I haven't gone outside in 5 years and my sister supposedly hung herself ,2
I didnt go outside for two years after family member died ,2
I more so find ot relatable because YAY mental health issues! :'D. . Like I also have the self isolation, a white-space Kinda safe space where I can just feel st home and comfy, and never want to leave because I "have" everything I need there... one being my own bedroom (which is starting to feel less and less like a safe space sadly) and my own imaginative world to keep me happy, same, and collected. That and wishing for things to go back to the way they were before all the sad things happened (for me it was 8th and 9th grade where I had the best of times even though my depression was more severe and I was more mentally unstable then). . E,2
I can relate to a few things in it, but only like two or three,2
I find almost everything within Omori relatable...minus the "hanging and accidental murder".. . I find a little bit of myself in Basil and Sunny, over-attachment, choosing fantasy over reality, depression, fear of loneliness, pressure from older sibling, the desire to just lock myself forever, harmful self-deprication and even the smaller things like introverted behavior are just some of what I relate to.. . . So yeah, it was a game that really hit me to the core.,2
I am the one on the right, I also never leave home, Don't eat that much, Have good friends,2
I find almost everything within Omori relatable...minus the >!hanging and accidental murder!<.. . I find a little bit of myself in Basil and Sunny, over-attachment, choosing fantasy over reality, depression, fear of loneliness, pressure from older sibling, the desire to just lock myself forever, harmful self-deprication and even the smaller things like introverted behavior are just some of what I relate to.. . . So yeah, it was a game that really hit me to the core.,2
im addicted to omori because i relate to sunny lmao,2
i just relate because the headspace is simmilar to our did headspace lol,2
i relate to the >! dead sibling !< and being a shut in part ,2
My sister died last year and I've kinda fallen into being a social recluse and my depression is just getting worse, I wish I didn't relate so hard ,2
I found Aubrey and Kel releatable,2
I relate to basil and sunny (i haven't left my house in 4 years and killed my sister then staged her murder as a suicide),2
Relating to the game is bad somehow. . I relate to Sunny somewhat and have a few disorders so uhhh,2
Uhh... ,2
well depression, dissociation, childhood trauma moment. its why snuuy is the best,2
Wait so you're telling me not everyone has pushed their sister down the stairs and framed her death as a suicide?? Not to mention feeling so guilty that you create a false reality? I must be crazy then,2
I relate in the sense that my little brother pushed me down the stairs out of anger,2
Its not exactly the same but omori has inspired me. Well like. Kel has inspired me. He’s a hard head at times but Kels coping mechanisms, constant optimism, and fitness has inspired me to get out more, and more importantly gain weight and muscle.,2
I murdered my sister on July 23rd, 2014. Her body was never found,2
It's a long story, but I actually feel like I couldn't appreciate the game's story as much *because* I related to him.,2
I relate to fucking my younger friend's older sister. . ,2
I relate to living in the best country on earth baby 😎😎😎😎😎🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸,2
I find relatable >! My brother killed me when he was 12 !<,2
I relate to the fatherless part,2
I mean kinda… I’m depressed lol,2
I find it very relatable. Especially when i kin Sunny and Aubrey. They're just like me fr fr.,2
I relate to the part about having well built narratives in your head to avoid coping and coming to terms with things!,2
Well I can bet that some of the **much less dark** parts of it could be seen as relatable, like seeing friends change after not seeing them for so long or how easy it is to see those friends as some perfect versions of them because you do not want to focus on the flaws that even you know might drive you or them apart.,2
omori is relatable to me (i’m a human like most characters in the game),2
Don’t worry. I only found Omori relatable after helping my friend cover up them accidentally murdering their sister, being lonely for 4 years, then stabbing myself with some garden shears 🥰,2
Oh no…,2
Giggles i sometimes wanna push people off a fucking staircase ,2
relatable for the depression part 👍,2
Because of my condition, the in depth headspace every night is very relatable. Almost scarily so. But nothing else lol,2
Just the themes of it. There was a point I’ve shut myself away from the outside for at least a year, and around that time I was so depressed that it felt as if something was looming over my shoulder, that’s kinda what seeing Something had me thinking of,2
Close,2
I find it incredibly relatable, like I relate to sunny, hero, Aubrey and Basil. Not because of specific actions or events (you know what I mean) but because I am depressed I have anxiety, I have maladaptive daydreaming that I use to escape my terrible life. I feel like a burden, like I am useless and I am just making everything worse all the time. I am angry at the world for doing this to me and the universe doesn’t even care. I wish I could stay in bed all the time crying and not do anything. Hence why I relate and I think omori is a very relatable game especially for people with mental health issues.,2
Haven't pushed anyone down the stairs but I do relate to the idea of having a truth that I know makes people see me as a terrible person and having to come to terms with it,2
I think it’s relatable in the sense that we can’t just pretend our trauma isn’t there. We have to accept the truth n overcome it,2
I relate to Aubrey from hating my parents who largely neglected me and to Sunny whose imaginative personality I often escape to,2
I relate to being a colorful figment of the reader’s imagination. Wake up,2
I relate to not remembering trauma, and having hiki-esque tendencies unless I was told I need to go to something, and feeling like everyone can see ‘something’ I have done at all times (tho in this case it was something done to me),2
well uh, you see, the funny thing is...,2
Sunny relatable,2
Unfortunately I do relate to the creating headspace to escape from reality part,2
I relate to both Kel and Sunny at the same time. But mostly Kel.. . Sometimes I feel reclusive, but other times I feel like I can run all over the place saying whatever and slightly annoy my irl friends while doing it. ,2
I can relate to basil when it comes to being absolutely terrified of change,2
It’s designed to be relatable what are ya talking about,2
sunny looks suspiciously like me,2
this post technically breaks rule 5 because the original image was not relevant to omori,2
I got pushed down the stairs TWICE. I was trying to got for Mari moment any%,2
I relate to humphrey,2
I’m just mentally ill and relate to the depictions of mental illness such as in black space and the nightmare sections.,2
I can relate to Sunny and Basil a lot, maybe Hero a little bit, but not because of any major events that happened. Mostly personality and stuff. Sunny is probably the one I relate to the most, since I barely go outside/miss school a lot, I'm depressed and a couple of other things that I won't bother to think about  also heavy on the personality part with Basil, when I play the game it's almost frustrating how much I see myself in him, and the fact that I look like him a little doesn't help,2
I find basil and sunny relatable (in some ways),2
I think a lot of people can relate to having trauma or just generally dealing with mental illness.,2
Me....,2
I relate to Hero and Kel alot!!! And I kinda relate to Auby too (AKA i relate to the three mcs that are somewhat mentally stable),1
Not really the story, but the character is relatable ,1
My brother is relatable not due to the plot being incredibly accurate, but the details being close. Lost my older brother to suicide via noose a few years back. Can’t really bring myself to finish the game due to the symbolism.,1
Omori isn't relatable for me, besides being in my room most of the day (besides school and other shit) but also that's just me being lazy and playing games a lot.   . Also I have never had a sister, only 2 older brothers and my parents are still going see strong with their marriage, also I don't have an upstairs house, don't think I ever lived in one. Almost did, with parents trying to find a better house thats for sale and the that's better than old house.,1
Omori Be relatable fr. I kinda endured a little bit of everything he had, really intestine seeing what your going through in a game. Kinda a problem but you know, I’m personally better now before anyone says anything like I need help but, because I had a really really bad time we will say I love the game and am obsessed with it,1
Babil ,1
I relate to Sunny in that I havent left my house outside of my backyard in some time (since 3 months ago i think) but my reason is different. I don't leave due to intense bullying that gave me some pretty bad anxiety. The bullying became sexual harassment and people using my sensory issues against me and basically forcing me into meltdowns.,1
I do relate to some parts of Omori. Obviously not >!Sunny's story!<, but I do relate to >!Aubrey's abandonment issues!<. Also, I have two anxiety disorders and the phobia sequences at the stairs were very accurate to some of the panic attacks I had. That and, of course, I've have some really bad bouts of depression in the past, especially when I was a kid.,1
Tbh it is relatable >!though without the stairs!<,1
I relate to it,1
i relate to ir,1
I can't relate to it, I killed sis intentionally :D,1
I think since Omori goes so in depth into the inner lives of its main character (and side characters) it can be relatable to many with specific aspects, for example I relate heavily to using sleeping/dreams to escape reality,1
Communities ranked by prevalence of mental illness. 1. Omori. 2. Steven Universe. .. .. .. 3. Undertale. . [source](),1
.... . Tbh, i DO find it relatable.. . My parents fight so often to the point where i have just made up a fantasy world where im happy.,1
i relate to the guy that has burgers on his mind tho,1
uh oh lmao,1
I found the game when I was at a really low point (severe depression and anxiety, having periods of time where I didn't think I was real, that kind of stuff) and honestly as fucked up as it was, it felt nice to know that I wasn't alone? Like yeah it's a video game but at least someone might understand what I was going through. So yeah, it's not fun to relate to, but it certainly feel like some solidarity ,1
my ass who uses dreams/sleeping as a coping mechanism and has like 3 people I talk to, that’s it,1
"Nobody" what kinda unrealistic expectations are these,1
related to the depression and napping just to go to imaginary worlds and fighting with my sister 👍,1
I kinda relate to the anxiety parts, basil's reaction is similar to mine,1
I mostly relate to Aubrey on a personal level. Genuinely.,1
As someone who has dealt with episodes of crippling anxiety, I can relate with the Omor ,1
I find some things kinda relatable. But, like, most of that is b/c I've got depression and use escapism/avoidance to cope with lit anything. (It is... a work in progress, heh). . So I feel like I get some of Sunny’s struggles, even if I don’t personally have it as bad. It makes me wanna keep an eye out for him! But he's not real, obv, so I'm kinda using it as a precautionary tale instead.,1
I found Omori relatable that’s why I got into the fandom,1
I find omori relateable mostly because of how sunny processes trauma, it's the same way I processed mine, making up a fake world and isolating myself, even the way intrusive thoughts were protrayed.. . Some may find it weird to relate to this game in that way but it was the first time I had ever seen a character cope with their trauma the same way that I did, it has really made me feel less alone.,1
~~I can seriously relate to Experiment 667~~,1
I got accidentally pushed down the stairs before, so there's that.,1
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|scream),1
i kin hector (head space) i just love how the character thinks ,1
i kin sunny ,1
If you replace >!mari dying!< with my childhood dying then yes omori is very relatable and he is probably the closest character to my exact life rn ,1
I find Mari relatable. . . By name.. . I'm terrified of stairs now.,1
If I didn't have a job that required me to go out, I would literally never step outside my apartment.  No guilt but probably a bit of depression,1
Omori like me fr,1
I related... a lot. It's made me think in different directions.,1
You related to omori because you hide your trauma. I relate to omori because I killed my sister by pushing her down the stairs. We are not the same,1
I relate to the isolated and blocking out reality part. I am not in a good mental state but thankfully I don’t relate to killing my sibling,1
Minus the homocide, yeah. I can,1
I relate to most things but I won't reveal what things-,1
I relate to all of the cast,1
I only relate to Mari bc of a (head)canon that she is EXTREMELY a perfectionist and tried so hard to be perfect and please her parents. That's why I love her so much, I see myself in her.,1
Depends:),1
It’s relatable,1
\*insert sunny AND omori kinnie moment here\* ,1
I mean I think Sunny’s pretty relatable on a basis of intense mental illness making it difficult to leave/go places and unrepentable ~trauma~ lmfao. And if you make it to my age (I’ll be 30 in 3 years) without one or the other following you around I’m genuinely surprised.,1
For me it’s the whole ‘staying safe indoors’ and ‘dreaming about childhood friends and places’ thing, and thankfully not the  thing.,1
I relate to being so depressed I sleep whenever I can and my reality and my dreams start to blur into one another,1
I actually can, and the game was a huge therapy thing for me- it really helped me in a lot of ways!,1
It's kinda relatable to me? Like I had an upstairs house when I was little (in my early twenties now) I accidentally got into an argument with my brother and he fell down the stairs. He survived though, some bumps and scratches with bruises. Cried to my mom, never been slapped so hard in my life.,1
Sadly,i do,apart from the killing my sister part,1
Haha, yeah, w-wouldn’t wanna be that guy haha,1
Haha I relate to Mari 😜 no one’s fault tho, i did it on my own,1
I relate to Aubrey, sunny, basil,1
I relate to kel ,1
Relatable, threw my cabbage patch doll down the stairs… felt guilty ever since.,1
>!Sadly I heavily relate to sunny!<,1
Wait is it talking about OMORI the game or OMORI like in the game,1
Currently playing the game while going on a  journey with repressed trauma myself XD,1
I've always been creating imaginary worlds inside my head,1
The only things that are relatable in omori for me is the fact that Basil is willing to cover up an accidental homicide to keep his best friend (or crush Idrk) and that sunny makes up a dream world in his head to cope with the accidental murder of his sister,1
i am sorry to disappoint but all the characters are insanely relatable to me in different ways. mostly aubrey and sunny/omori though.,1
ok ya. but what if someone related to fnaf ,1
The fact that Sunny had to move on without his friend hit close to home, I spent one year in a game design school with a routine I liked in a town I liked, but I had to quit despite loving it,1
I relate to omori moving out and having to say goodbye to his faraway town friends,1
I relate to sunny wanting to go back to the good old days of childhood 😭,1
I did a terrible thing last year and forgot about it for a year. People's gonna hate me if they would know. I told about it someone and he left me though. Now I prefer to not to think about what I did and live in my imaginative world with my lovely friends when everything was fine yet (before this all has happened),1
Omori IS relatable tho,1
But it IS relatable,1
>!You didn't have a good childhood if you didn't throw your sister down the stairs !<,419
So you are a Chad?,29
K Mikhael,14
The chadverick,15
So you got beat by a starving kid and a basketball kid?,1
I relate to the blatant older sibling favoritism with the two characters that *do* have parents ,69
Wooow same, buddy 🤝,59
My dad is just dead, he didn't leave lmao ,12
That ain't even you finding OMORI relatable at that point  that's OMORI finding YOU relatable,216

You look like you would be fun to **hang** with           👉👉 haha another murder joke i hate my life,51
I love Ur avatar please I want my happy meal,3
To be honest I can relate. I have Maladaptive Daydreaming, and I always spent my time in a safe zone that isn't related to reality. People constantly tell me that I should pay more attention to reality but I'm too scared to face it. I prefer to stay in my own world ,108
This.. . I accidentally mentioned I found Sunny relatable to Omocat herself (she asked who my favorite character was) and we joked about it when I was like 'well not THAT part', and she was like 'Yeah I was going to say 'are you sure about that' and we laughed. And then I realized I probably would have sounded more normal if I said like, Space Boyfriend or something.. . But I am very unwell a lot of the time so I live in isolation and escapism, with other certain destructive habits, and guilt. I mean >!I didn't kill anyone obviously !< but yeah, besides that... I am basically a hikkikomori, lol.,13
Yeah this is something I relate to a lot! I isolate myself constantly and I daydream a lot. As you said, too, it's not as bad as Sunny, but it's still very relatable,2
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|surprise) —>. . HE’S LITERALLY ME,91
This right here— its not the *literal* situation people relate to. People relate to the overall themes like depression/anxiety, grief, isolation, etc. . . For instance, one if the reasons OMORI was bittersweet for me was because it so successfully portrays how surreal/alienating it is to come out if isolation and see that everyone and everything has changed around you, while you stayed the same.,58
i relate to the childhood guilt,44
Yeah, that's pretty much the reason I can relate.,2
[removed],42
You're racist and a bully? Damn..,18
I hope you do better.,6
hope you get better, even if I can't directly help, you have my best wishes.,3
Most redditors do,24
same,3
Did that impact you while you played omori the first time? It’s not as bad, sure, but I bet it’s still a very unpleasant memory,37
I’m actually a little shocked this is the only commenter who has made someone fall down the stairs. It sounds quite scary though, sorry :((,22
>!I accudentally pushed my sister into a giant barrel filled with sulfiric acid!<,20
>!the murder and non negligent manslaughter rate are about the same as of 2020 in the us 21,570 murders 22,000\~  non negligent manslaughters 6.5 per 100,000 i.e you'd need a sample of 100,000 people to find 6 murderers omori has sold 10x that amount this has statistically happened 60 times 120 if you count murders (I'm doing this at 3am very tired please forgive possibly bad math)!<,7
please >!do not get in an argument at the top of the stairs with her!<,11
Same. Like, I have: 's personality, 's passion to hate old friends, 's chance to me do something weird funny crazy shit if I'm bored, being big brother just like , despite of all that I also own a bit of 's kindness >!(and stairs are also pissing me off)!< also I believe I have my own counterpart of me in my dreams cuz in dreams I have things I would probably never have irl including trauma demons. Aaaand that's all.,25
Oh yeah, because I can kinda see myself in all of them.,3
flair checks out,2
Spoiler tag,4
We're just silly goofy  def not hiding any of our feelings ,1
Are most characters in omori actually human? Since most of headspace is not human.,2
fr fr,1

I don't have sibling (never had), I had a good childhood anyway.,93

Eyyy mommy and daddy issues 🤜🤛,45

Brooo same. . RIZZ me up while ya at it🤙,2
Nah mf relating to omoriboy,36
🤣🤣🤣🤣,2
How long has it been since you were outside?,16
this robot mf really booted up from october 2022 to copypaste a comment from someone else,10
Don't leave me hanging, that's no good.,23
Sure thing, that will be $69.69. Credit card please!,1
Same.  . Tho I have a very active imagination but not Maladaptive daydreaming (I didn’t even know what it was and I had to go read about it which was really cool I know it has its ups and downs but I think it can really help in Art and writing ) but when I can’t imagine the space I want I cope with it by doing some Art or Gaming.,40
Omg maladaptive daydreaming buddy!!,7
Through a bizzare blend of mental issues, my brand of maladaptive daydreaming is involuntary, like it's my default state. Focusing on anything at all requires a monumental amount of effort, including things I've managed to hyperfixate on. It's analogous to holding your breath, do it too much and you'll shut down as your body takes over. Being able to relate to sunny made the game's plot hit me... *really* hard, especially with my sensitivity to suffering, guilt, and losing the things you love, and it taught me a lot of things about myself. After 6 straight months of crying at least once a day, anything Omori related has taken up permanent residence in my eternal daydreams.,4
I don't think I have maladaptive daydreaming, but I can still relate to this a lot, in class (if I even go) or whenever I get the chance I'll start daydreaming and I'd much rather do that instead of facing reality,2
🧢,1
he borgor,19
he jus like me fr!! ,14
👆,5
...do I want to know what it's about?,11
That's what he's racist for,31
It did a bit, yeah. I feel guilty whenever I watch that scene & intrusive thoughts aren’t very good in combination with that. It’s definitely the most guilty memory I have as well. 😅,35
I hope to god this is a joke. ,10
Amateurs,1
Too late, but >!we both are alive !<,4
I have Kel/Mari’s personality (who knows how that works) Basil’s interests, extreme trauma, and Aubrey’s mommy and daddy issues . . I also fell backwards >! down some stairs (and many other stair related injuries) as a child so I relate with Mari on that one!<,14
Oh I forgor,2
haha we're defo just borgar ,2
Are you sure you never had one? Think long and hard.,104
You dont have one because you threw them off the stairs so hard they stopped existing,21
It was a joke ,18
>!Neither does Sunny anymore!<,4
H o w,2
[rizz](). . You've been rizzed,2
,5
How bad is it if you can relate to it?,2
Probably didn’t leave the hospital he was born in.,20
Oh, my bad. Last time someone said that kind of shit to Basil, >!they got stabbed in the eye. I guess they only survived by **shear** luck ✂️!<,29
It can be really useful for Art (coming from an artist) but sometimes it might just make everything else a troublesome task. Like paying attention to class, coming up with solutions, doing chores and other things in general , but it's useful when you have free time and you're bored,20
YESSS,2
no,24
Ofc not, who doesn't love to have a sulfuric acid barrel as housing decoration?,2
BRO ARE YOU /J ,3
Change that,3
I did the opposite of what mari did many times by falling up the stairs more than falling down em,7
Yup, never had.,38
>never had. . BUT!!! I have an story.,7
I know.,17
he said.   . >never had.   . . so it won't work,3

Yep and I still do it from time to time,2
I never had bruh.,28
It's was a di\*k move of my part so no. (tbf, I was like 4-7),7
I had plenty of time to play, my parents (and family in general) were always good to me as well, although I never had friends, only acquaintances I'd say that my childhood was better than what I could wish for.,1

Yes,6

Bro wtf? ,5
made a joke about Sunny being a switch,9
Something about how Sunny is a switch because he had a crush on Aubrey both before and after the incident ,5
Those two situations are not comparable at all, jfc when will you pro shippers learn. People enjoy video games for a multitude of reasons, and none of those reasons have to do with fantasizing about actually killing people.. The implication of saying a child is a top/bottom/switch is done for only one reason, and that's sexualizing kids. It's an unnecessary comment,7
sad fact,15

Proshippers are people who think ANY ship is okay, no matter if it's paedophilia, non consensual, incest, beastiality, etc. Of course, this means they heavily romanticize these topics and normalize them. It's a huge issue in Fandom spaces, and is why in some people's bios they will straight up say "proship do not interact".. . . Honestly, they're just paedophiles in denial considering you can often find then sexualizing kids, or defending media that sexualizes kids,4
search up "Base Delta Zero", then look at the sky, it should be a pretty good day with chances of 99% of occurring a turbolaser storm, see you on the other slide,3

It's kinda funny that Aubrey carries around a NAIL BAT but cries when sunny uses knife ,125
This has got to be my favorite piece of Omori fanart. The feeling when someone holds up a knife to you, let alone a childhood friend, is fucking *terrifying.*. . Aubrey saying to Kel “at least I don’t hang out with a psychopath who carries a knife around” was one of the most impactful moments in the game for me, maybe because someone was *finally* acknowledging that Sunny is far from normal. Idk it made him a lot scarier in my eyes, even if he was just a broken kid– again, threatening someone with a knife? Yikes. . Edit; And more relating to this fanart, the artist really captured the shock and horror in everyone’s faces. Great choice to not show Sunny’s face, I think it all works really well together,124

To the people saying the bat is “for intimidation” and that “she doesn’t use it”. She actually does use it. Her normal attack is “Aubrey attacks ” and will play the bat swinging animation on whoever is attacked.,26

Oh that mkes more sense, i always imagined she got stubed in the side (around hips) but i guess this makes way more sense,1
Even if Aubrey was unarmed she still has like 5 of her friends who could jump in probably 4 out of those 5 would be easily able to overpower sunny. Bro is justified.,1
I love their shocked faces sm,1
Aubrey deserved it ,1
yes she has a bat but she never uses it does she,1
Anyone know link to artist page or something? I enjoy this art style,1

Careful now, you're gonna attract a lot of Aubrey fans who are gonna tell you "she only uses it for intimidation" even though she very much uses it and the menus show her equipping it. . . We have many Aubrey fans on this sub smoking copium.,113
She's most certainly a bloody hypocrite I'd say.,3
Wat,1
I mean Aubrey hangs out with a group that actually abuses, steals and is a public nuisance, I’ll take a child with a knife as a friend any other day,17
>Aubrey saying to Kel “at least I don’t hang out with a psychopath who carries a knife around” was one of the most impactful moments in the game for me, maybe because someone was finally acknowledging that Sunny is far from normal. Idk it made him a lot scarier in my eyes, even if he was just a broken kid– again, threatening someone with a knife? Yikes. . I think the impact is lessened a bit for me because she's one to talk... since she carries a nail bat around.,35
Kinda coincidental that kel means bald in turkish,12
baldmori,7
That made me chuckle,7
People who say she doesn't use her bat are on some hard-core copium,21
yeah, but by the looks of it, the nails in the bat aren't all the way through. so yes, it is a nail bat, but only the heads of the nails are hitting.,-3
: holy shit….. ok that makes me sad, lemme just ⏮️. . (Sunny un-stabs Aubrey). . :…..how?. . : ⏮️👍,41

I'd like to hear your reaction after you find out who he is lmao,1
Charlie is as strong as a fucking huge oak tree. There in human,2
(sunny would bite aubrey, giving her rabies),1
A common steak knife is obviously much worse!!,154
I'm pretty sure this is the vine that everyone thinks of when they see Sunny or Omori.,24
This is dumb.. . Everyone knows Aubrey's tank is pink. Get your facts straight smh.,79
Text in combat says “aubrey kicks you”, “aubrey punches you” etc. . . Violence, just not bat violence,68
"ummm actually a bat with nails in it is far less dangerous than a steak knife" 🤓,22
Carrying it around in the first place and using it for "intimidation" is still enough to justify using a comparatively small knife to defend yourself.,22
Not the biggest Aubrey fan, but she never uses the bat in-game, just in the cultists section, and that was Sunny's dream, so yeah. She readies it before a fight then her sprite shows her just having it on her back, and if that wasn't enough the battle log explicitly says she kicks, punches and stuff like that, never something like "Aubrey hit Sunny with her bat", not once on Kel or Sunny. As I said, I know Aubrey did awful stuff (not as bad as  tho) but you have to be fair on the fact she never uses it, at least on her friends, so it could be just intimidation, it could be that deep down inside she still cares about Kel and Sunny and doesn't want to open their skulls lol. . And then you have Sunny with the steak knife doing a little trolling ,20
Fr though like mfs she attacked us **first** and Sunny didn't even hurt her enough for it needing medical aid or something smh,10
Yep. I don't blame Sunny for bringing a knife man ,3
Sunny and Kel would die if they were hit by a nailed bat.,2
She only uses it for intimidation tho ,2
:you ruined them basil. . &#x200B;. . (throws them in the bin),3
LOL,3
XD,5
but the recicultist quest was a daydream?,3
Copium, also known as reading comprehension. The game at multiple points acknowledges the direct danger of the bat (the comment in the menu Sunny has on it being more dangerous than the knife, the fact that she has a skill where she uses it and it can literally instantly kill someone), so the fact that no comment is ever made on her hitting people with it, but a comment is made when Sunny cuts her, makes it blindingly obvious she's not using it on anyone and that they just reused assets since they're tied to Aubrey. . . Now, if Sunny were in his right mind, I'd say it's just fine that he used the knife to defend himself from someone who had a bat (even if Kel didn't seem concerned with it, presumably because she hasn't used it on anyone else either). But he's not carrying the knife around for self-defense. He's carrying it around because he's barely cognizant of reality and is behaving as if he were Omori in Headspace, where murdering things with knives is just how things go. All the fights with the hooligans end with everyone at worst like, mildly scuffed up, so presumably they aren't especially intense, so someone actually using a weapon on someone is concerning. If he weren't a malnourished shut-in who probably weighs less soaking wet than Kel does normally, someone might've gotten seriously hurt.,7
Um, it probably still really hurts.,5
THE MAVERIK: Did he just use Crazy Diamond?. . : Dora 👍,18
: I didn't mean to harm her like that. I simply wasn't in the right state of mind.. . : It was in self-defense, and I-. . : I didn't mean to.... . : .... . : Come on, Sunny. We should go before this gets any worse.,1
Even more reason to show that whelp your plot armour,1
I don't think Kel can take another loss lol,1
Nothing compared to Kels basketball!,137
Funnily enough...no it's not.,13
Yeah... Sure.... . ^(ayo),14
Yeah. Tho funnily enough her head but hits like a fucking TRUCK! She doesn’t need the bat,45
Ya, like if Aubrey actually used her bat, she would legitimately one shot people and kill them. There would be no "fight" for us to win lol and Kel and Sunny wouldn't be walking around afterwards.. . The only thing I can imagine is that Aubrey used the bat for intimidation and actual gang violence (if that exists in faraway).,35
She has a skill called homerun in which she uses her bat.,6
iirc she did use it in the church fight?,2
But also "AUBREY attacks x!" with the aubrey attack animation, which is meant to be a bat, or bat-like weapon,1
The game itself says otherwise,8
Definitely, Sunny was justified in defending himself, even as a fan of Aubrey!,18
No, she doesn't. She uses it in one of her skills.,0
: Guys, I’m a Stand user, look. . : oh hey I’m the stand. . : what else can your Stand do?. . : I can make people omor☠️. . : what?. . : yes,16
(aubrey would hit snuuy over the head with her bat 5 times),1
Nothing compared to a single tiny can of pepper spray.,82
Even if there isn't any hardcore gang violence, even smaller towns that I know of have their fair share of juvenile violence (at least between kids in different parts of town or from different schools). It just depends what crowd you run with. I would assume Aubrey would be exposed to that.,10
She specifically has a skill, homerun, in which she uses her bat. And guess what, its an instant kill move,20
so sunset in faraway?,1
As I already mentioned in a different reply. And guess what, the skill can only be used in the recycultist dungeon (you know, the imaginary world where Sunny and the gang murder people), and it is in fact an instant kill move. Meaning the danger of the bat is not underestimated,21
average copium addict,1
No, she just held it. Using the bat is a kill-move. (As seen by her homerun skill),10
no the knife has 30 attack which is higher then the bat, it's just sunny attack stat is pathetically low. (even if his hands hit harder then heros),1
especially since this is probably sunny’s first time seeing aubrey pull up with the bat, who knows what she’ll do?,3
The Recycultists are Sunny's daydream though,7
It isn't canon,are you telling me they just have a rpg battle in the middle of a slap fight?! It's only there to make the game interassting,2
: Can I get a superpower too?. . : I used a stand knife on you. You already have a stand. . : Hey, I'm a stand. . : Awesome! What do you do?. . : It's Aubin time. .  (Gets brutally killed),8
 (Sunny is unconscious.). . (What will Kel do?),1
>!Or Basil's rope!<,29
Nothing compared to Hector.,5
good bot,6
If that's her using the bat, she's **real bad** at it. Honestly for a once per fight skil, it's could at least deal low damage.,3
but the only time you get to use aubrey irl is in a dream sequence so moot,3
(sunny can tank it with persist do),2
I mean the description of Aubrey's bat, if I'm remembering correctly, literally says that it's more dangerous than a steak knife.,2
Yeah sorry bad memory.,2
: …..shit, not again. Why can’t I heal him?. . : don’t worry, I used my ***\[BY YOUR SIDE\]*** on Kel, he’s perfectly fine now. . : oh hey cool I’m a ghost too. Am I my own STAND?. . : I think you’re just dead, Kel.. . : so… no one will comment about me… just coming back from the dead?. . : naaaah, i see bizarre shit like this on a daily basis. . (BIZARRE INDEED),6
: IM GONNA DO THE SAME THING TO YOU, YOU BITC-. . (aubrey would knock him over the head with her bat 5 times like she did to sunny),1
not sure, but this should probably be spoiler tagged.,13
That has low accuracy tho, >!the target has to be paralyzed first.!<,13

: i fucking regret hitting kel and sunny,1
I've been playing the game nonstop for a couple weeks so far, I have around 50 hours in the game so far. But I see people who debate some of the most obvious questions, and it's like, even I know that and I'm new here. I really feel this is one of those games you just need to really get into in a quiet room with the lights off, it's surprising how many people here say they haven't experienced it for themselves. Love the entire fandom though nonetheless.,374
I really regret watching the game before playing it myself,367
honestly i'm convinced the majority of the fandom didn't actually have the attention span to play through the entire game and just feeds on fandom content; that or they just aren't emotionally mature enough to even understand wtf is happening. i get the game is long and padded but i can't count how many times i've seen people viciously debate like their life depends on it over an argument that is obliterated by a blatant detail in the canon game they were somehow entirely unaware of up until that point. . . half of the time people subconsciously argue over fanon, surface-level versions of the characters they got overly attached to their headcanons of instead of the actual characters in the game; real discussion is so convoluted and rare bc everyone wants to fight for the morals of whichever character they personally resonated with the most (eyes directly on the aubrey and basil mfs pitting the characters against each other). . so much potential yet we're left with basically the old undertale fandom but worse. maybe the hundredth community-dividing "vote the worst character" poll will save it /s,520
"Don't fuck with us omori fans - we're younger than the cast",212
the made a game out of it?,138
I fucking love air conditioning,65
I think my biggest annoyance with the fanbase, is how Bagel is treated as a character. He's easily the most misrepresented character. His entire personality and character is always either summarized as "Gay Flower Boy" or "Total Psychopath and Deserves 100 years in Jail". There is almost no in-between. This oversimplification of his character is honestly kind of sad to see, because he's easily the most complex character of the bunch, but he's also probably the most misunderstood character.. . It's incredibly sad to see, as someone who's favorite character playing the game was Basil, to see how the fanbase generally treats him and his character. The discussions always boil down to "He's probably evil or smth idk" instead of actual discussions about how interesting he is as a character. For example, one thing I thought about the entire game, was the fact that Basil probably suffered the most out of anyone after >!Mari's death!<. Hell, even Sunny probably suffered less, if only because of headspace. Basil had no headspace however. Basil:. . * Has no present parents, and his grandma is literally dying.. * Lost all his friends. They either went to college, locked themselves away, or even started bullying him. Only Kell stuck around (the real one he is).. * Took the blame for everything Sunny did after the event. This, of course, caused Aubrey to hate him leading to the bullying.. * Literally had to go to school with the guilt of knowing what he and Sunny did, hoping that nobody ever finds out.. . I don't know if anyone else understands the feeling of having done something and not wanting someone to find out, but having no control over that, but that feeling is easily tied with being hungry for how awful it is. The hints that Basil is suffering more are even highlighted by the fact he's the first person to actually choose to >!commit the dead!< in the neutral route. It's not Sunny, who you'd think would want to do it the most considering, but no. It's Bagel who acts first because he had no one else to fall back on, unlike Sunny who had his Headspace. Obviously none of this is to say each character didn't suffer, or a competition on who suffered less. It's just a point to highlight when people bring up Basil as a character and misrepresent him as Frollo levels of evil.. . The herb boy is so grossly simplified and misrepresented in the fandom that it's really sad. For a game that has such a good message, it's really sad to see people honing in on a single character and portray they so commonly in a bad light, all because of a single action. Considering the true ending of the game, that quite literally throws the entire message of the game away.,164
10000000000% im about to leave this sub as well. As much as I love omori. And I thought the fandom for undertale was bad,45
At what point does the soyjacks appear to sing with Omori Boy?,42
I saw the game on game pass and the pixel style(I don’t know what it’s called) kinda turned me off. But after hearing about how it’s one of the saddest games ever I decided to play it. So I dove into the experience with no knowledge of anything about the game. And it was an amazing experience. But after I beat it I didn’t truly take in how soul crushing it was until I was laying in my bed a few hours later. But playing the game was 100% worth it. And now I get to be here with you all, enjoying memes of Hero tagging Sunny into the afterlife.,36
Don't fuck with us omori fans... we..... . WE HAVEN'T LEARNED A SINGLE SHIT!!!!. . ,36
Honestly, I feel like my biggest issue with this fandom is how they treat Basil and Aubrey.. . Basil is self-explanatory at this point.. . But Aubrey, it just feels like it's a war crime to even question her behavior throughout the game on this sub.,28
The Omori fandom is truly the South Park fandom of game fandoms.,50
one of my massive issues with the fandom is " is evil." NONE of main cast are evil, the entire game shows each and every one of their trauma responses. a huge plot point is how each of their responses contradict one another. each character has their own response, some being better than others, but none of them reacting well. they're not evil, just traumatised, and there's a huge difference.,24
Wish ii was auby,61
Yeah with some of the takes that are so confident but so wrong where its like, do you know anything of the game,68
Bought it, played it, obtained the true "secret" ending, never played it again because things are on their best as I left them,14
No. That's the Persona fandom,13
... is there people here who havent beaten the game?,11
“Basil is so cute and innocent!”. My Brother in Christ, he >!hung the corpse of his friend’s sister in an attempt to frame it as a suicide.!<,97
Metal Gear Raisin moment,10
I'm on my second play through for a different ending. I think this is just another case of a really good game having a terrible fandom.,10
Ive literally seen 10-12 year olds in this fandom in places like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. Like get the hell outta here. I get that its the preteen idea of “Im ToTaLlY mAtUrE eNoUgH sToP gAtEkEePiNg” but bro- you’re not even old enough to play the game OR use those sites without a guardian. Go play Minecraft or something. ,10
Also I feel a little uncomfortable because of so many minors in this subreddit, since the game is obviously 18+. FNAF feelings lol and last time I said that in an old account ppl said I was gatekeeping??,20
I encounter this the most with Dragon Ball. 90% of the fanbase still do not understand the powerscaling and the lore of the series despite it being branded as a story that has no complexity. Mind you that the DB fandom has a lot of adults compared to Omori, which I feel is made up of a bunch of kids and very young adults that are below the age of 25. With Dragon Ball, it's 30+ yr olds that still never watched Dragon Ball, only Dragon Ball Z & GT, & sometimes Super.,9
Omori is a game?,7
i left the fandom for a while and came back to a cesspool of just... whatever you call this. sucks to see as someone who waited for the launch of omori since it's first trailer. . ,7
But.. I did. ,7
The ones who played or watch it aren’t talking about it on Reddit. They’re talking about it with their therapists.,5
guilty gear fans 🤝 omori fans. . not playing the fucking game,5
There’s people here that haven’t played or watched the game? Yikes. I first watched a complete playthrough, then some months later I played it on my own. I have watched a ton of analyses on the game. That game broke me and changed me. I’m not as obsessed as I used to be, but I still love the game and will play it a third time. And probably more times after that.,4
i played through the sunny route and cried like a little baby thank you very much ,4
The fans really weird me out.This is a game about loss, suicide, self acceptance, forgiveness and much more deep topics, yet people treat it as a disney cartoon fanbase. It's hard to take it seriously anymore. . Omocat isn't helping by becoming a vtuber....,6
POV youre reacting to my “Sunny is kind of evil throughout most of Omori” take,4
I am an Omori veteran from April 2021 and I still have questionable takes sometimes 😎,4
I don't get it, if you haven't even played the game why the fuck are you acting like you know shit about it?,4
i've played the game like several times but never on my own, always on my friend's computer. we have a lot of fun,3
Persona 5 fans, Metal gear rising fans.,3
Basil when melon,3
I am exactly that mene and I don't know why reddit is reccomending me this subreddit and r/omorimemes,3
Lots of little kids who shouldn't be on Reddit or Twitter probably just see the artwork and get really into the fandom but don't have their own money and thus can't buy the game themselves.,3
I know I'm a little late to the Party, but I wanted to say something as well.  . . . I've noticed that different subreddits of different games tend to ruin the experience for me.  . Same happened with Omori.  . . . When I first played it, I had **no idea** what I was about to experience. Never heard of the game, never saw a single frame of it. Literally just saw it was on sale on Steam and had almost only positive reviews.  . . . And now I'm here. Finished 100% of the Game. I love the Story, the characters, the writing, everything. Although the Gameplay-Part is somewhat lacking. But it's a RPG-Maker-Game. So they made the best of it.  . . . When I found out about this sub I was expecting a community of people like me. People who really enjoyed the Story. But it didn't take long to realise that a huge part of this community seems like they never even installed the game in the first place or are just not mature enough to understand what is going on.  . . . The other day there was a theory-post about Aubrey being an unplanned-/accidental child.  . And OP said, that this theory might be "disturbing"...  . I mean.. are we talking about the same game? psychological horror, self-harm, depression, suicide, murder. All of this and we say **unplanned parenthood** might be **disturbing**?  . . . Also: Im aware that most fandoms love to do this, but I never understood it.  . The whole headcanon and shipping thing.  . There is a Story. And it's canon. Someone put a whole lot of work into it.  . If I were that person and people would start to make whole thread-discussions over a topic that isn't even officially part of the game I would totally lose it.  . Same with the shipping. The game suggests 2 possible love interests. hero - mari (which is pretty obvious) and sunny - aubrey (which is implied in the late-game)  . So why would we start to make up anything other than that?  . . .   . I guess all i wanted to say is:  . as fans of the game, we should all respect the art.  . And a whole lot of people on this sub are just way too young.,3
. . This happened in the game guys trust me,4
I mostly watched the game. I played a bit of it though.,6
Lol I’ve played and watched way, way too much Omori.,5
I have been on this subreddit longer than I have been playing the game itself,2
I totally feel you! When I see people who hate Basil it makes me assume most of the fans must be kids who don’t really get the game because Basil is almost as much of a victim as Sunny and sacrificed everything for him,2
I barely interact with fanbases now due to that sort of thing being way past me, aside from a few discord servers. So what is going on with this fanbase that people are pulling a DBZ/Persona and not actually interacting with the source material? Not understanding certain characters?,2
I mean takes I can't justify because people are dumbasses but fan works are called fan works for a reason lol. They're not meant to be canon,2
I discovered Omori some months ago. I had a friend who said it was a great game but didn't spoil me. The only thing I knew was that the people in the fandom were afraid of stairs but I had no idea why. I couldn't play the game myself but I watched a blind playthrough by one of my favorite streamers and I really enjoyed it! Though, I wish I played it myself 🥲,2
The fandom sometimes seems a little too fixated on who's "fault" the pizza incident is and just in general wanting to find the main scapegoat for everything bad that ever happens in the game out of a friend group comprised of depressed teenagers.,2
I don’t disagree but some people don’t draw the line between people who don’t understand the game and people harmlessly having fun,3
me fr fr,1
...I have to tell you guys something ,1
I recommend you don’t visit tumblr then,1
I feel like this fandom generally just misinterpreted the the overall message and how the game is . . People seem to only latch on to the headspace characterisations of the characters . . As the headspace counterparts are meant to be simple but then they add it to the rw cast and it doesn’t make sense plus with added headcannons and putting all sorts of random pro nouns and hobbies and lgbtq sexuality stuff (which they don’t have and we aren’t shown to have). There’s nothing wrong with lgbtq characters in games it’s just the game doesn’t even show them to be like that. . Like if omocat wanted them to be apart of it, wouldn’t the game show us and even heavily imply it?. . But no instead we get people misunderstanding characters . . I think another character that’s mid understanded is MARI. She is either shown to be an egotist or such a wholesome person who is perfect in every way. But we are never shown that she is . Sure she is a kind person but she is by no definition perfect, from the photo album we can see that she is insecure about making mistakes and that she doesn’t think anything she does that really good is not worthy (reference being the flower crown rw description or the photo of her getting camera shy). . While MARI is a “mother figure” in the group she is also a massive troll however people only associate this with HERO and completely forget the photo where MARI stole BASILs camera to take a picture of SUNNY and BASIL reading . Although this is more understandable . Then people viewing her a narcissist . . And I feel like people misrepresent HERO. Although it’s less bad but still weird . Like people think HERO would kill SUNNY after the truth I get it’s a meme but there are fics out there that are like that and that’s not like him at all the only time he lashed out was at KEL but that’s when he was at his worst but after his rant he realised that he unintentionally hurt KEL he stopped. People also think KELs and HEROs parents abusive to KEL when while they have their favourite they are never shown to even abuse KEL if anything KELs mum is strict with KEL because how much she worries,1
There are so many people wandering around Roblox Omori builds who don’t know the story (but will within five minutes when someone makes a joke about character deaths),1
I cant afford omori cuz its like 760 buckaroonies in my currency but i *did* watch ALOT of Omori and i could tell you alot of things about the easter eggs. SPOILERS AHEAD!. like that one poster in orange oasis that says YOU DID IT! in front of stairs(ladder but okay) and with a jump rope on the ground, we all know what that means.,1
Spoiler? I feel like this image is sorta major,1
I’ve never played the game; Reddit recommended the subreddit and I thought the art style was cute so I stayed. . . I don’t even know what the game is about or what genre it is !?!?!? . . Yet, here I am nearly a month later.,1
People having innacurate fanworks or headcanons does not mean they didnt play the game, they just want to have fun and dont care about the lore police.,1
Is this another typical redditor everything-must-be-canon-no-artistic-or-fun-fandom-freedom-or-queerness-allowed thing or is it about people genuinely the misunderstanding characters? Because that definitely happens lol,-3
I watched like 3 youtubers’ playthrough,0
I feel so called out I tried playing the game I am just stuck on this one section and can’t get through it lol, most of what I know is from watching my dad or brother play/talk about it,-1
I have never played the game before, I didn’t even know it was a game before I saw it in the store(xbox). I was recommended the sub and liked the art.,0
I know the whole lore and I haven't seen a single gameplay of it and of course I haven't played it yet,0
Nah that’s Persona fans,0
Okay i only WATCHED it,1
I got over 104 hours on steam but only 54 % the game my regret I wanted 100% but lazy,1
Me with undertale for the longest time,1
i went in blind and played through the game last year. i still havent recovered.,1
I spoiled myself before playing because I didn't think I'd be able to but then it came out of consoles. Even after that I've played three times and loved it anyway lol,1
Not as bad as undertale,1
I dont even know what this is . . This community just happens to appear on my home page,1
Me.,1
I've never played the game before (i don't have any ways of getting the game rn but i do eventually wanna play it), but I have watched several playthroughs of Omori and while I still had a few questions about the lore (for example: I was confused why Basil took photos of Mari's death before learning that it was just Omocats way of telling the truth and that the photos weren't actually taken), I feel like I've been able to understand a lot of the story of the game and I really enjoy the story.,1
I regret playing it,1
[removed],1
played it then told my friends to play it. they watched it and still got trauma,1
i dont even like the game and im not in the fandom either (i saw this post from reddit recs) but even i watched a 20 sth hour gameplay of this to determine if i liked it or not. i cant believe people dont even play the game but are fans of it. very interesting.,1
i played through the game twice, once on pc a few days after launch, and once on switch downloading the day it came out and then i bought a physical copy. . i like the gameplay plus messing with the glitches is great,1
real,1
I have played the sunny route and Omori route and gameplay wise I liked omori route more but feelings wise it has got to be the sunny route,1
The ending got spoiled before I even knew what the game was...,1
Me who played the game first,1
I played for about 20 hours, before having to set it down. There are some elements that hit very close to personal experiences and it’s been tough crawling out from that pit I fell into. Fantastic game and I can’t wait to finish it and cry my eyes out more,1
I watched an explanation video and then only got through half the game because I kept dying during the SG fight.. Getting stuff spoiled for me is the same reason I refuse to watch that show with the giant robots and angels and whatnot.,1
"Don't fuck with us Omori Fans! We WILL cry!". . I did actually manage to avoid major story spoilers, even though I watched my sister play a good portion of it (Up to Sweetheart's castle, but excluding most of the first faraway town section).,1
I did, it was great. I got all the achievements!,1
me fr fr,1
I played it up until the slime girls and then gave up ,1
That was me for so long until I finished the game. I had it pre-ordered when it came out on switch but didn't get paid that month. I later ended up with two physical copies and I love the game so much,1
Just like persona 5 fans but they watched it at least,1
I lowkey hate rpgs, so I just watched a play through, lol,1
i played for 5 hours, couldn't past an enemy, and just completely forgot about the game,1
Im very proud to say I played the game not knowing a single thing about it. My brother enjoyed watching my reactions while playing the game since he spoiled it for himself. I honestly was at lost for words at times while playing and currently I’m doing the kikikomori route and I’m still getting blown away. Sometimes the fandom does cringe the hell out of me but fandoms wouldn’t be fandoms without some cringe included,1
gonna be completely honest i have over 100 hours on the game and i have every achievement but there’s still a few things i’m not sure i completely understand,1
I played through the game throughout the span of a month and a half. Starting halfway through January (19th) and ending in March (3rd) of 2022. I only played through the game once, and that one playthrough lasted just about 30 Hours.. . I think the fact that it took me so long to finish it is one of the reasons why it was so memorable. I even documented all of my characters stats as I played so I wouldn't have to keep checking them manually. After I finished it on March 3rd (technically 4th because I finished it at 1 A.M.) getting the good ending, I stayed up for the rest of that night just... thinking about it. Talking out loud to myself about that god damned >!"Left up to Interpretation"!< ending. I continued to think about and be depressed about it for a *literal week* afterwards.. . It is one of my fondest gaming memories. It felt so great to feel such extreme emotions over an art medium that I have always felt passionate about.,1
,1
True, while I’ve played the games and have over 100 hours in it, many of my friends who are OMORI fans unfortunately just watched the game, that’s ok, but I’d recommend playing the game, it’s a way better experience,1
To be fair. If the game is designed to look and work like the game designed for kids, there will be some kids tricked by it and majority of kids will want to continue to play/screw around with game just because it’s actually age restricted content. So once their in, they have no reason to leave.,1
Is haven't played the game and i don't like it.,1
I played Omori,1
I literally walked into this knowing nothing about the game because it was on sale for switch. I have sunken almost 30 hours into this game in 2 weeks.. . What have I got sucked into.,1
I got traumatized by the game.  .  . And I **like** it.,1
but i did play the game): i finished it twice):,1
I can't imagine people loving a game without experiencing it...that's so weird. I found this late on Xbox gamepass before it was taken off and was lucky enough to finish 1 playthrough before the Xbox removed it. I'm so mad that I didn't find it sooner, one of the greatest games I've played in a long time,1
Played 22 hours in 4 days as it was leaving game pass,1
Number . . ?,1
I played the game pretty much exclusively late at night while streaming to a discord call with 1 other person who had played it before. They didn't give any spoilers, because they're based.. . I was constantly on edge, worrying everything could go to psychological horror at any moment! :D,80
Out if curiosity, can you give an example of an obvious thing people were debating?,47
>I've been playing the game nonstop for a couple weeks so far, I have around 50 hours in the game so far.. . Off topic, but "non-stop" for couple of weeks & you got 50 hours?!   . . . Bro, whenever I play a game "non-stop" legit, I easily get 50 hours in 5 days, even less. I finished the Witcher 3 within 5 days lol.,1
ahahah, 50 HOURS? I got the game 3 days ago, and yesterday I played for 7 hours straight. My total amount is 20 hours,1
i watched a 90 minute long video on it like a month after it was released but i only came to actually play it some months ago,101
Same  . . . Deadass wish I could fucking reset my damn brain so I can experience the game correctly,38
I feel like most of the people who did this watched the exact same video,16
I went into the game knowing that Mari died, and how (though not by Sunny, just by stairs), and despite knowing pretty much nothing else about the game, I really regret not being interested in it a few years earlier... . . Why couldn't you have listened to world's end valentine sooner, me?!,2
I bought the game but my decade old laptop lagged while trying to play it, which really wasn't enjoyable. I had to watch a Let's Play series instead.,3
So true! I didn't watch it like a full play through but I did stumble upon clips and stuff . . I would of absolutely adored playing through it all without knowing anything 💔,2
I didn't even finish the game and now I know the truth,1
[removed],182
Same. It sometimes feel like 80% of the fandom hasn't played the game nor has the intention of actually discussing it. Just looking at the way the characters are treated hurts. (Me seeing the 162th argument of why "Aubrey bad" while blatantly ignoring one day left and her development, or another fanart of fanon Kel being nothing but a complete moron because god forbid we look at the character as more than surface level). . The worst ones is people twisting canon so it fits their headcanon or argument when there's a rare conversation about the game.. . God don't get me started on the polls. It blows my mind that the mods even allowed that in the first place, when it breaks a couple of rules. ,72
Omori fans 🤝 Persona Fans. .      We didn't play the game,18
Basil haters probably didn't even play the game,109
>they get overly attached to their headcanons. . . . Guys....the changes has started... The gatekeeping made it worse.... We... We are turning into THE UNDERTALE FANDOM,32
I'm not trying to instigate an argument, but I've personally never seen anything as outrageous as you claim. Do you remember just one specific instance that makes you think like this because now I'm intrigued.,14
>i get the game is long and padded but i can't count how many times i've seen people viciously debate like their life depends on it over an argument that is obliterated by a blatant detail in the canon game they were somehow entirely unaware of up until that point.. . >half of the time people subconsciously argue over fanon, surface-level versions of the characters they got overly attached to their headcanons of instead of the actual characters in the game;. . . . "Aubrey is abused by her mother". . "Kel is in the wrong for confronting Aubrey". . "Basil is obsessed with Sunny". . "Kel is secretly depressed". . "Sunny is evil". . "Aubrey was right in doing what she did". . "Kel has been the only one knocking on Sunny's door for 4 years". . "Basil wanted to kill both Sunny and himself". . "Sunny's Dad is an asshole". . "Sunny's parents knew the truth". . "The entirety of the Omori AO3 community". . >!"Mari was alive when they hanged her"!<. . "Sunny is controlled by Omori",28
Tbf my dad doesn’t have the attention span and the entire prologue is probably a few long before you actually get what what the games about… still agree though,2
i played through the game twice, and some of the shit i see on here is wild lol. . i get liking fandom content as even i do with sunny x basil but god damn at least respect the actual canon in the game a little bit,5
For me the best example is the SunnyBasil ship, like man it's so dumb,0
There's a lot of subtext in the game, but I've noticed some people play games when making their points. For a recent example, whether or not Sunny left his house after everything that happened.. . We have a character saying he hasn't left his house in years. No other character denies that statement.  Cris, who came back shortly after Mari's death [three years before the game's events], acted as if she hadn't seen Sunny in years. . . And yet, since we can't definitively prove that Sunny never left his house, there is just a small chance that he did leave his house. Despite statements from multiple characters saying and acting as such.,-11
From headspace💀,89
I heard Omocat's making one yeah, might be a scam though with how long it's taking,100
Real,1
i think basil is interesting within the fandom because he's a really good example of how scapegoating can be propagated; to the point where it extends outside of the fictional friend group in the game to the real beliefs of the fandom itself. (>!psychology sidetracking below since this is a good topic imo!<). . basil is easy to shit on because there's no actual reasons to not shit on him that the game provides you. he victimizes himself by taking on the blame for his friend's wrongdoings because he'd rather see himself as the problem than them. to sympathize with him requires the effort of putting yourself in his shoes on your own and willfully trying to understand his motives which some people might be less open to doing than others. . . the game--assuming that you want to offer him the sympathy and moral support he needs--provides you the option to help him out, **but**: sunny is perfectly fine >!fucking off and leaving basil to die because it means he can repress him and all of his own wrongdoings that basil took the blame for without consequence or difficulty. that's why the neutral ending isn't called the "bad ending" despite being "the worst" ending; basil killing himself is quite literally the natural, expected result of the situation taking it's course on him;!< he's that hopeless.. . since basil's wellbeing relies entirely on the sympathy of the player/mc and half of the remaining cast heavily feeds into his unconditional self-blaming (sunny+aubrey), someone attached more closely to that portion of the cast may rather try and justify those character's actions by reasserting basil as the problem as a lot of people lack the nuance that both sides may be flawed and would initially believe it's one or the other who is "at blame". . ...and basil, naturally, is the easier target because his character doesn't actually defend himself in any way and is the identified patient (scapegoat) of the friend group's interrelated wrongdoings i.e. the person presenting all of the symptoms of conflict: since he's constantly the one seemingly at blame for all of their problems and pleading forgiveness >!(often for things he didn't do)!<, if you remove him everything will "seem" fine even though it actually isn't. that's why sunny can so easily carry on by >!repressing his suicide and thus entire existence in the real world,!< because he was the only thing reminding anybody that something was wrong with them in the first place. he's the only one who tries to take on the burden of everyone else's issues so it's only natural to conclude that he is the issue himself that they must be rid of.. . people who resonate with his character more are more likely to actually understand his position (as is with any other character) but his position is predisposed to defenselessness thus receptive to vitriol- if that makes any sense- so he naturally leans towards being an easy punching bag for a self-driven community like this one because he doesn't make any canon moral arguments to justify himself. basil's morality is at full mercy to the empathy of whoever judging him. . . i agree people should actually treat the characters with the individual nuance and sympathy they deserve since a lot of the fandom likes to make it a black-white "well, who's worse?" scenario, just wanted to go on a tangent explaining why his reception is so (unfairly) polarized since he's a more delicate and complex character. (>!and it's so sad that basil, aubrey, sunny are all incredibly lovable and flawed characters who made up in the true ending yet people still want to argue over the traumatic conflict they canonically accepted their hurtful roles in and tried to move on from.!<),135
It hurts a lot of what I see from these people.... Basil is my favorite. Because im more of an omori when i was going through shit. And I admire basil more. Im sad now,25
And I don't like how people continually make it seem like Basil has nothing to atone for.,25
Note: Kel did not stick around, implied by him being unaware of everything regarding Basil - Aubrey.,6
I'm tempted too honestly, this is why I like to search for smaller communities bc they're much less toxic. With this fandom I take solace in 2 facts. . 1. A lot of people say this dandom is worse, but at it's peak the undertale fandom was much worse than anything that exists today (not many go as far as attempted murder).. 2. The undertale fandom nowadays isn't nearly as bad due to most of the immature people growing up/moving on (there are still some tho).. . Well, time to start a war in the omori discord by saying "basil is straight" /j,32
I wish this community could go back to just making funny memes like that...,14
I meet this game because a close group of friends would constantly throw trash at the game, however i saw it on gamepass and decided to give it a try. I was almost instantly hooked with the plot. Ended up really enjoying this game a lot and now i feel happy that i didn't listen to them my friends back in the day. Im honestly really disappointed because no one seems to actually have played the game. I joined here to post a meme myself, and never really hanged up a lot with the sub but i do find it at least a lil shocking that people really haven't played it,3
Sunny and Stan Marsh somehow generate virtually the exact same discourse, down to what people think of their friends and family in relation to them,35
,18
saem ,19
I sense a group hug coming ,12
Saaaaaaaame.,1
No. That's a lot of fandoms. Danganronpa, Persona, Omori and Undertale all share this. People like the designs and the style and then start creating headcanons for the characters and declare themselves as fans of the game, because they think they know the characters. The Persona fandom wasn't even the first with this issue...,16
You'd be fucking surprised at the quanity of people who have such a low amount of commitment for thing they like that they don't even have so much as the vicarious experience.,16
That just makes me feel even worse for him. . He was a kid, not a psychopath. He must have learned that somewhere like on tv or smth because his parents weren’t there to stop it idk.,59
Those two statements are not mutually exclusive,70
Chad headspace bagel vs virgin faraway town bagel,37
Everybody makes mistakes ,20
I'm gonna be honest, fandom often says that some people think he is innocent but I've never seen this take. Maybe someone was saying this ironically?,10
I just finished the game yesterday, got the good ending and secret ending on my first time, and do people really despise Basil for what he did. I know it caused more problems than solved it but, I am curious if >!Sunny was in it as well since we kinda saw him carry her body to help Basil but it is f- up that Basil took photos of it happening which typing this out, made me realize it was messed that Basil did it!<,5
Dude, basil IS cute and innocent because he didn't kill anyone and his a murder for his best friend. Best omori character.,3
People can’t realize that “game staring teenagers =/= for teenagers” when it comes to western developed games,8
...the game isn't 18+ though? It's definitely not suitable for younger kids, but a lot of older teenagers do fine with it.,1
Yeah, someone on this thread already did it,1
You should play Omori!. . I promise you that you definitely won't be traumatized!,2
Why ,3
Yes,2
I meant “canon compliant fics” lol,1
It's an horror rpg, it's about a boy who lives in his dream world because he's an escapist, he can't accept an harsh truth, when he wakes up he sees Something, so he decided to live an ideal life in his dreams, but sometimes he's tormented by Something there too. His journey is about finding peace, and to save his best friend Basil who seems to have drifted away,4
I was more or so talking about “canon compliant” fics and I didn’t mention anything about fan canon lol,3
The second one lol,18
What part are you stuck on?,1
So how would you compare the main cast's (6 characters) behavior in headspace to their behavior in the real world?,2
My heart wasn't ready,3
When youre a kid you can't afford much so I think it makes plenty of sense,1
If you just want to obliterate, give Kel the Beach Ball Weapon, use Coffee on him, make him Ecstatic, have him Flex, make the boss angry, and then next turn have him use Run N' Gun on the boss. He'll do like 5000 damage in one hit.,3
Our experience was basically the same then with the exception of talking to someone, I wanted that complete silence so I could get super scared lmao. . But I think that's an issue that a lot of people in this fandom are having, they watched someone play the game already online and now they feel no reason to play it themselves. I was lucky enough to know NOTHING about it before playing, but it sucks how many people spoiled themselves, accidentally or intentionally,36
Lucky you, i cant convince any of my (above 30 iq) friends to play the game ,3
man i came in knowing how bad psychological horror could get but i just took everything at face value. . "aw cute game! hehe basils house-  hi sunny!!". . so i wasnt scared waiting for anything which i think is kinda funny ,2
An easy example would be the arguments that "sunny is evil" or "basil is innocent". Can't think of any more complex ones I've seen off the top of my head,51
Well it's more like "nonstop when I get the chance" lol. I'll put in as many hours as I can when I can, but unfortunately my console stays at my dad's. I'd say out of the 2 weeks I've mentioned, I've only been over there for 5 days at most. Just put in about 5 more hours since I made that post lmao,2
lol refer to my other comments where someone else mentioned that,2
I watched a video about the history of it and how it was made and accidentally spoiled myself of the ending 🥲 didnt make it any less enjoyable though and there were still a lot of things i was unaware of, but still,4
Amnesia or Dementia, your pick,2
I actually watched Phisnom's playthrough lol,1
idk I just finished it yesterday and i could have sworn I knew parts of the game from somewhere before,1
This is exactly why I absolutely HATE the “Omocat told me, it’s canon” meme people do, or “if kel’s in it it’s canon” people say it’s just a joke but istg people be saying the most baseless shit is canon and defend it like it really is. They just say EVERYTHING is canon even if it’s not so who really knows what’s canon if you haven’t played the game. And it’s genuinely impossible to tell when it’s a joke or not at this point.,45
Headcanons and ships are fun though, for the most part it’s what keeps me invested in a fandom a lot, I only wish most of the spaces that talked about them weren’t so toxic and angry,52
I got into this game completely on accident and it’s one of the games that I’ve found myself actually having physical reactions to my emotions towards this game. Little details that are dropped in sentences seem to never fail in amazing me when they are utilized later.  One of my favorite pieces is when >!Aubrey talks about basil and Sunny’s withdrawal from everything after Mari’s death. Then the reveal came and it shocked me. (I haven’t completed the game, I still have about 2-3 hours to go. Stuck on the OMORI VS SUNNY fight 😂)!< regardless, the game has a lot of content and it takes a good Chuck of time. Since I’ve been spending more time playing it than I’d like to admit, I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look into this fandom fully, but just from what I’ve seen on other social medias, it’s strange seeing how they treat characters. . . Anyways, Mr. Jawsum for the win,7
You guys need to realize the difference between people who haven’t played the game and people who are just having fun💀💀. . Edit: cooking me for being right😭,-19
"Aubrey bad, no redemption" thing is such as annoying thing because outside sure, but there's plenty of stuff scattered around the real world to explain why. (Spoilers naturally):. . >!Her going to church to repent for how she feels!<. . >!The way she blames basil for the defacing of the book that omori caused!<. . >!The stealing of the photos to cling onto what little she has left of mari!<. . >!The fact that most of her friends shrank away after mari died leaving her alone and bitter towards them!<. . That's just a few off the top of my head, there's likely more.,36
People think Aubrey is bad because they think “oh no boo hoo, violence” as though violent is a permanent stain on your character, she was misunderstood by the cast for the longest time, it would make sense that people would be all like.”oh no poor soft boy basil was abused by gorilla Aubrey. Like naaaah, basil at least deserved a flick for all of that coward shit and the stabby,16
I am both, this is too true.,5
I think most basil haters like me are just doing it ironically though, could just be me,43
I played the game, and I couldn’t help but find basil annoying, sympathetic, yes, but putting myself in Sunny’s shoes across the endings really made basils presence feel anywhere from unsettling to annoying, which is kinda the point? I dunno. The way basils face starts to contort as they begin to anxiously lose rational thought is annoying, chad maladaptive daydreamer vs virgin panic attacker,-8
I hate basil because he is sad and pathetic. I love hating him because it's funny,-29
&#x200B;. . ,-12
>!Mari was alive when she got hanged!<. . Or. . >! Sunny's evil!<. . I guess it's not hard to see how those two are related, and how improbable both are,13
Okay, most of these aren't correct, though I will say that Aubrey's mom is, at the very least, implied to be neglectful, which is a form of abuse.,56
Some of these are pretty possible tbh,6
Well, sunny's dad abandon his depressed child and wife, kinda of a asshole If you ask me,17
I'd like to add another one: . . "The gang saw >! Mari's hanging body !<". . This was literally never implied at any point in the game.,2
then what explains that black space room where a man (likely Sunny's dad) was like ''Stay away.. You are not my son"? He had no reason for saying that besides the truth.. . Also Kel is hinted at repressing his emotions at the graveyard scene where he is smiling while describing his parents neglect.. pretty bad takes ngl,5
I deadass had an omori fan who was TEN get mad at me because I didn't want to talk to an elementary schooler 😭😭 they were so dry,5
LOLLL,3
what the fuck is an omocat?,35
Damn bro, take my upvote.,27
This is all so fantastic. Really amazing explanation of how a lot of people seem to see Basil.. . I didn't mention it in my original post, but I definitely do agree with how people tend to have a problem with sympathizing for two sides, especially when the two sides were both involved in **Something**. It feels like for a lot of people, it seems like it's instinctual to have to idolize one of the sides, and then villainize the other. It's a fantastic example of how taking things at face value, and not looking at the world in black and white shades really helps in understanding certain contexts. It's honestly really worrying how people argue over who has the worst trauma. Like dude, even if it's just a game, you should never argue over who has been through the most, especially when most people haven't even experienced what certain character might go through. Obviously, and again, it's just a video game, but that shouldn't change the fact that it's still interesting to talk about these things, but how Basil is treated by most of the fanbase, that's a problem because it actively impedes real discussion about his character.. . I think my favorite part is how the game handles Basil, or at least his relevance to the story. He's barely even in the game for the majority of the early and even middle parts. He feels like a ghost so when he does show up, he leaves a big impact. And while it's a bit of a story tangent, I love how this is explained because Basil is really the only person who truly knows about the incident. It's a great way of showing how important Basil really is, because of how little he's present.. . But my favorite part of all, is how it is literally impossible to get the >!true ending!< without interacting with his plants. He is literally the most vital part of getting the >!true ending!<, but it's never mentioned, nor explained that this is the case. It is entirely out of the want of the player (or the spoilers) that they end up watering his plants to get the >!true ending!<. I think if he was anymore present in the story, it might end up ruining the impact that his flowers really have.. . It really highlights how important Basil actually is, because without helping him get over his trauma and fears, it's impossible to truly help yourself/Sunny. It's also a great way of showing that it's entirely up to you as the player if you want to truly help the kids or not. It's a complete individual decision to water those plants, and the game never tells you, and I love that.,4
wow this is great writing. Could you convince me that Sunny cant be seen as purely evil even in the true ending? From my POV, theres an argument to be made that Sunny just kind of only cared about himself to the end, and his character arc was him learning to love himself when in reality he should have learned to truly love others.,9
>he person presenting all of the symptoms of conflict: since he's constantly the one seemingly at blame for all of their problems and pleading forgiveness (often for things he didn't do), if you remove him everything will "seem" fine even though it actually isn't.. . I didn't really see Basil as the scapegoat considering that most of his friends treated him normally. Only later does Aubrey explain why she bullied Basil in the first place which paints the picture of Aubrey as the only one who actually blamed him for anything. Basil did scapegoat himself as the one who drew over the pictures but I think that's minor compared to the big reveal.. . >to sympathize with him requires the effort of putting yourself in his shoes on your own and willfully trying to understand his motives which some people might be less open to doing than others.. . The whole sequence in real life was made to sympathize with Basil >!even after blaming himself for the photos.!< He is constantly the target of Aubrey and the rest of her friends and Sunny and Kel are given the goal of trying to protect him.>! As the risk of Basil commiting suicide increases, I think most people felt compelled to save him. The reason why people hate him so much is because of his involvement with the incident and attempted murder of Sunny at the end which is completely contrary to his character up to that point. I think that if Basil was replaced with any other character in devising the plan to stage Maris suicide, they would get almost if not the same amount of hate simply because coming up with the idea of a staged suicide is much worse than committing the accident in the first place for some. If any other character tried to murder Sunny in fear of them leaving, I think they would get a lot of hate too.!<. . Also, I think its also hard to say that Basil suffered more>! since Mari and Sunny were obviously a lot closer being siblings.  !<. . >Literally had to go to school with the guilt of knowing what he and Sunny did, hoping that nobody ever finds out.. . Being able to go to school is a sign that things are better off for Basil considering that he is even capable of having social interaction even if he didn't have any friends. Sunny on the other hand is unable to go to school at all and basically doesn't talk to anyone but his mom.. . >Hell, even Sunny probably suffered less, if only because of headspace. Basil had no headspace however.. . Even with headspace, Sunny is still haunted by his extreme fear and hallucinations in the real world. If Basil is capable of going to school and acting relatively normal despite his anxiety and guilt, it's implied that he is able to cope in his own way significantly more effectively.. . &#x200B;. . >>!The hints that Basil is suffering more are even highlighted by the fact he's the first person to actually choose to commit the dead in the neutral route.!<. . I think it's kinda arbitrary to say that one commited suicide before the other since it's basically inevitable sunny commits suicide in the neutral ending even through the omori route where he never gets to see Basil irl.. . I do agree tho that it's bad to be oversimplified as either the stereotypical evil character or the gay flower boy since there is plenty of nuance in his character. I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified.,7
Who tf does that?. . I have not seen this attitude even  a single time.,2
That's fair, though I would imagine Kel still checking up with Basil every once-and-a-while based on some things said in-game.,1
attempted murder???,10
that just means u have to play a game with the best community ever (outer wilds),4
Wait attempted murder?? What happened in the Undertale fandom??? ,2
They even both do the character design thing where they have 2 strands of hair sticking out.,14
Coming heheheehehehehheehehh,5
As someone who does gardening, a noose is a very common knot that most people who deal with plants would know. It's commonly used to hang plants up and stuff, so it would be completely fair to assume that Bagel learnt how to do that just by nature. . . Literally.,57
I mean sure he can still be cute, but innocent not so much.,22
...that's not a casual oopsie...,0
IMO, he is just a sweet and sensitive kid who was thrown into a traumatic situation and handled it poorly. >!He believes the murder was accidental and wants to help Sunny hide it to save his friend from the consequences.!<. . Whether this makes him innocent or not, I'm not sure where I stand.  I guess not? But he's not evil or even a bad person from my perspective.,38
>!basil did not *literally* take photos of mari's hanging. the segment where you recover and watch through all the "photos" is meant to represent basil's recollection of the incident!<,59
You should read the [unused descriptions]() for the black space album, they explain >!a lot of the details of what exactly happened plus Basil and Sunny's thought processes. Basically Sunny was in a completely dissociative state and just went along with what Basil was telling him to do, hoping it'd be over soon and not fully believing it was even real. Basil on the other hand was desperate to protect Sunny from consequences, not thinking that anyone would believe it was an accident.!<,33
I understand it was the panic of the situation that made him do it,but it still super fucked yo,7
Yes, hanging your best friend's dead sister is very innocent.,2
Yes it is, look it up on Steam or any site selling it.,2
unless its on switch I gotta watch it on yt,3
Because ,4
Idrk, I just haven't really heard of it and saw Merg played it, so I watched some videos, then watched a story summarized video. Then just kinda watched from the beginning, and I realized the game was pretty cool, and here I am after pre-ordering an omori plushie that isn't gonna be here for a few months.,2
I mean that's one thing but I've seen people get upset over just some fanfics in general lol like they're headcanons,1
Well, fanworks is a damn broad term. Canon unoverse fanworks can deviate from canon because they *are* fanworks.,0
Ok nice. . Downvote was unnecessary tho,-7
Inside the whale, I got to this puzzle room and just couldn’t figure out the puzzle, haven’t played in months cause every time I’d pick up the game I’d just wander around not knowing what to do,1
I knew a bit about the game before since I had watched my sister play it a bit, but I only saw the Space X-BF and Sweetheart headspace segments, and a bit of the first Faraway town segment (specifically, the fights against Angel and The Maverick).. . So basically the only major spoiler I had was that Faraway Town existed.. . I really enjoyed the game,8
Moment,1
Sunny's just guilty of involuntary manslaughter and basil of covering it. They're simply not evil nor innocent,35
Oh ok ,2
Nah lobotomy,2
They probably aren't old enough to know what canon means,14
Or we just kept them separated from the canon stuff,9
[deleted],1
\*Sunny,12
I agree with the first part but not the second, Basil >! already had been through so much guilt and nobody deserves bullying.. you can't really also blame him for the stabby because he had a psychotic episode, it's not like he was calculated and aware of what happened in reality!<,1
i see it mostly the other way where people say that aubery is a girlboss and stuff for bullying basil and the demonize him to insane degrees,1
nah man I've heard people talking about how much they genuinely despise basil and how unforgivable he is (despite the opposite being literally the entire theme of the game),89
So you admit to treason then?,42
Yeah, me too. (I personally watched the entire gameplay all Easter eggs too.),3
Yup I fuckin hate Basil but I'll be the first to admit he did nothing actually wrong,-12
so you basically said you are not a Basil hater lol,1
Putting yourself in Sunny's shoes is literally the worst way to look at it,8
Projecting much?,5
She's severely neglectful and she's also putting Aubrey's health in danger, judging by how trashed the place is.,35
His mother isn't a saint either for not even visiting Sunny, or maybe it's just that when the game takes place she was outside doing the paperwork to move,1
Keep in mind that that scene takes place in Sunny's mind. We don't know if this is an actual memory or just Sunny's way of blaming himself for his dad leaving,5
probably a gay feline idk man,35
appreciate the compliment!! not sure but i'll try my best to summarize to my knowledge (focusing on the route up to true ending) good typing practice since i find this is an interesting take lmao. . i don't like the idea of "pure evil" as a moral concept in regards to this game but i'll still try at a (spoiler heavy) counterargument.. . .. . comically short summary: . . as daddy longlegs said: "how does one define malice without intent?". sunny in reality is consistently portrayed as having never carried ill will in his actions so by that logic he can't be evil.. . .. . comically long summary:. . there's an argument for omori being an "evil" character in a certain way but >!omori and sunny and entirely separate entities. !<. . sunny is, at his core, a depressed and traumatized child who's immediate coping response was to try and mentally prolong >!the time he and his friend group happily spent together when mari was still in it..!<. . the day that sunny leaves his house in his route and reconnects with kel is, in a sense, him leaving the house as the same emotionally and developmentally immature 12 year old boy he was the day he started isolating himself in it. sunny is forced to both unlearn 4 years worth of life in a lonely, false reality in the span of 3 days and also come to terms with what he lost and caused in the same timeframe too (>!which ofc to such a mentally stunted kid is going to be jarring and overwhelming. !<). . his mind's only learnt defense against negative emotions and trauma is to block out the stimuli causing it, and since sunny as a kid was stoic and kept his issues (>!like getting frustrated with playing the violin!<) to himself >!until he snapped (recital day)!< he never established any reliable sources of emotional support besides.. mari. >!and even on recital day; if you check the truth album's text in the game files, he only pushed mari after she frustratedly tried to block his path so he couldn't escape, meaning the push!< most likely wasn't out of impulsive anger but instead desperation to escape the situation, same method his brain only knew to retreat back to throughout everything that happened afterwards as a result. . . the days after >!mari's death!< sunny resists basils attempts at >!helping him remember their memories with the photo album to come to terms with what was lost and later scribbles out the photos and isolated himself; none really implied as malicious acts of spite against basil and the rest of his friends but as a mentally distressed response for sunny trying to mask the pain of remembering what's gone and the self-loathing of being responsible for it.!< it's not that he chose to ignore his mistakes; he psychologically could not bear living on knowing what he did that his mind had to desperately block all of that trauma out from ever disturbing him, without choice.. . that further developing mental response to the trauma then manifests as >!omori (sunny's mind disassociating from who he even was as a person because of the guilt), who *is* described in deeper well as an "evil form" in the sense that it's sunny's uncontrollable, maladaptive coping mechanism and not a representation true to sunny or his wishes. omori is uncontrollable as the creator of headspace because he is literally sunny's constant depression+repression personified. !< despite this, the constant headspace fog and self-questioning: (>! "do you **want** to high-five kel", "do you **want** to save basil", "do you **want** to pick up this photo", "do you **want** to open the door"!<) show that despite his stubborn coping response, sunny--in opposition--does still have a will to ease into making social gestures and personal decisions that threaten the repressive escapism he's emotionally relied on. he always loved his friends; he just struggled to mentally bear the reality of >!mari's loss!< and his guilt for what it caused. along with that, all the confusion and conflict stemming from >!mari's supposed suicide!< was entirely a result of sunny's coping response and not a decision he could have consciously maintained (>!somewhat supported by omori killing truth basil in blackspace regardless of whether or not player wants to save him when prompted!<);. .  >!the final fight with omori!<--where he overcomes his maladaptive repression to finally remember both the good and bad memories he made--is symbolic of him breaking out of that harmful cycle so that he can mend his bond to the people that his real friends have become instead of to his self-protective childhood fantasy of who he wishes they could all still be, risking the consequences of him sacrificing the blissful ignorance he relied on to survive until that point so that his friends could finally have enlightening closure regarding what tore their friendship apart in the first place and properly heal from it.. . lengthy read (>!i've never tried to question his morality so thoroughly until now!<) but the counterargument i'm trying to make with this is that sunny isn't "evil" because *almost all* of his harmful actions after the beginning of the game are >!perpetuated by omori; his subconscious internal repression that he doesn't even fully understand!< rather than himself. when real world progress is made, when sunny discovers the truth, when the storyline develops in a positive direction and the final fight starts, it's never carried out as omori but as sunny, even if it's still somewhere in his mind. sunny is always the one making the gradual effort to improve himself for the wellbeing of his friends >!whereas omori is the one trying to actively stall and prevent that positive change!<. even shortly before moving there's really no reason for him to even have left his house again for his friends if he wasn't concerned about them anymore. which imo is evidence.,13
While I'm not certain if you meant to respond directly, I'll answer some things.. . >Being able to go to school is a sign that things are better off for Basil considering that he is even capable of having social interaction even if he didn't have any friends. . . I think there is a little more nuance to this than just saying "He can do something that the other can't, therefore better off". That's a little simple. Just because Basil is able to do something, doesn't mean he's better off, or not suffering more. Just because someone can go to work everyday, doesn't mean that there aren't issues in their life. People can hide things, and Basil has evidently hidden the truth for all the time that Sunny was hidden in Headspace. . . The biggest point though, is character progression. Generally, the most painful part about trauma, other than the trauma itself, is accepting that it happened. Sunny at the point of the game, is a constant static character. He's trapped and literally isn't able to accept it because that's what would truly hurt. It's only because of Kel that Sunny was able to accept things. Basil was in a constant mix of accepting it and denying it. He knows for a fact of what they did, but he's always denying it because he doesn't want to accept it. It's a constant back and forth, and every time it he thinks of it, it probably hurts him. I think that, personally, it would be a lot better to just not be able to think of something, over having to wrestle with myself over if it really happened, knowing full well that it did. . . So just because he's able to go to school, doesn't mean he's better off mentally. If anything, it probably means he's worse off because he doesn't have a sleepy little daydream to escape to.. . > I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified. . . My main issue isn't if the hate is justified. I think a little criticism is good for everyone. My main issue is how none of the other characters are even remotely criticized as much, or as harshly. Sunny is almost never criticized to the point of Basil, and that just feels unfair. It feels like the mentality of needing someone to hate. Someone has to be labelled "worse" because there always has to be someone responsible for bad actions. And it seems like most people settled for Basil. . . It also doesn't help that Basil is probably the most complex character in the game, written and gameplay-wise. He barely appears in the game, even near the end, so most people reasonably can't get a read on him. However, it's the nuance that he never appears that pushes his character. Think about the flowers. It is never told tot he player that they can go back and water his flowers after the first part, and this is entirely intentional. It is entirely up to the player wanting to do something nice, wanting to help someone, that ends up allowing them to get the true ending. It's entirely up to the player wanting to help Basil, that ends up netting them the best outcome. . . This is pretty much how all of Basil's character is told. Every bit of his character, with no exceptions, is told through nuanced bits. >!His fight, Final Duet!<, his appearances. His character is almost never actually obvious, and his history is even less obvious. For a character like Aubrey, we are pretty much told that her family isn't the best. It's pretty bad actually. But we're never told about Basil's parents, and can really only see what's implied. He says that they're always travelling and never really home. Obviously this doesn't mean they're bad people, but if they're never home, they are pretty bad parents. This is just one example of the player having to actively look and analyze the nuance of Basil's character instead of it being told face-value.. . Sorry if that sounded harsh. Hope that got at least a bit of stuff across.,10
"attempted murder of sunny" bae they were literally both trying to kill each other (each others "Something"s),4
>I didn't really see Basil as the scapegoat. . It's within meta-context. Basil is used as a scapegoat in order to victimize Sunny.. . Speaking from personal experience, the majority of Basil-hate is somehow related to Sunny.. . Sunny this, Sunny that, wah wah poor Sunny.. . The other 3 are rarely brought up, and even then it is more of a sidenote.. . >!Sunny is treated like he is a genuine victim even though he is the primary culprit.!<. . &#x200B;. . >>! attempted murder of Sunny!<. . Context of this is a >!psychotic break. Basil meant to attack 'Something', not Sunny.!<. . This is a general thing. People either fail to realize or intentionally ignore the full extent of Basils issues. . . >!Psychosis is the root-cause of literally every questionable thing he ever does, including the 'truth' and his fight with Sunny.!<. . &#x200B;. . >>!Being able to go to school is a sign that things are better off for Basil considering that he is even capable of having social interaction even if he didn't have any friends. Sunny on the other hand is unable to go to school at all and basically doesn't talk to anyone but his mom. !<. . Sunny *can* go outside. And he *can* speak. . . He just refuses to do so.. . And Sunny still has Head Space. While it's not perfect, it's a whole lot better than nothing.. . Basil doesn't have that luxury. Hell, he has full-on psychotic breakdowns on a regular basis.. . I do not recall Sunny suffering from that.. . &#x200B;. . > I do agree tho that it's bad to be oversimplified as either the stereotypical evil character or the gay flower boy since there is plenty of nuance in his character. I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified. . . The problem isn't the hate existing in general.. . The problem is the sheer hypocrisy and bias that come with it.. . Sunny is arguably worse, yet no noteworthy amount of hatred towards him exists.. . The reason for this is blatant bias. People generally like him and will go out of their way to present him in the most positive light possible. This includes baselesly assuming things and ignoring even the most obvious negative implications.. . Prime example are the >!scrapped captions of the BSA.!<. . >!They point at dissociation and pretend that this somehow means Sunny has nothing to do with the cover-up, even though his state did neither prevent him from realizing that it was a horrible thing to do nor did it stop him from feeling relieve at the prospect of escaping the blame.!<. . >!The worst thing is that, according to the captions, Maris death wasn't even an accident.!<. . >>! Photo of Panic!<  . >  . >>!It happened in an instant. You didn't mean to do that. Well, you did mean to push her, didn't you? It was an accident, right? You're not sure. You tremble your way down the staircase. !<. . >!It's openly stated that he meant to push her.!<. . >>! Photo of Guilt!<  . >  . >>!You want to scream for help, but you're afraid... you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? There's no way you can tell them the truth. Who would be able to forgive him? Who would believe... that it was... an accident? !<. . >!Look, 'm sorry, but I don't know how else I am supposed to frame this:!<. . >!Sunny made a concious decision not to call for help. The reason being a fear of consequences. This is NOT okay.!<. . >!He literally prioritizes himself over Maris literal life.!<,6
Er, the post I was responding to?,2
Well, i somehow didn't ever notice that out of the dialogue through the multiple playthroughs.. . "You do you" then.,1
Around the height of Undertale's popularity, almost everyone was finding some new way to depict Sans or anything related to him. This included the "fontcest" ship... which ships him with his brother Papyrus. Obviously people had a problem with this. . . One artist of internet fame was an active proponent of this ship and openly defended her right to depict it. Eventually another fan allegedly gave her food with metal pins in it in an attempt to murder her over this. There was photographic evidence. . . Needless to say, incestuous ships are disgusting, but attempting murder over a work of fiction is beyond ridiculous.,6
Yeah I've been searching for something like that. I've found that the OneShot community is pretty nice and wholesome. Also shoutouts to the tiny but very nice Mother: Cognitive Dissonance community.,1
Something something shipping something something needle cookie (why is it always shipping?),2
Yeah, that too. . . But the ’staging a suicide to cover up manslaughter’ part he could’ve easily seen in a movie or smth,21
that was not a casual situation either. Bigger stakes, bigger mistakes :p. Can't expect a kid to act rationally,11
Ohhhh I forgot there was a part where >!A mirror is shown and there's no camera!< I just finished yesterday and already messed up the story 😭,35
Unused content isn't canon though.,1
I guess it also adds that they were really young at the time and didn't know what to do,11
He did it for friendship. He is innocent.,2
It's not 18+ on Steam. I got it off of Steam when I was 16 or 17, it has a message about how it "may not be suitable for all audiences", which is standard on any psychological horror with no specific guidelines on exact ages.. . Admittedly, I googled to see what on earth you were talking about and the physical switch copy (which only released last year) has given it a rating of 17+ in the USA and 18+ in Europe, but this is recent, and still not displayed on Steam.,1
Well I have good news for you.  . [,2
It was probably a rando that didn’t like the first part of your statement lol,12
The red, blue or green one? Also, there are tutorials online for each one online, I needed one for the red puzzle lol,3
so real ,2
Just visit Geometry Dash like a month ago and your wish will be fulfilled,1
That’s just not how fandoms work. Headcanons and ships shouldn’t warp perception of canon but people can have them and talk about them,3
Honestly, one could argue that it was OMORI or SOMETHING working through Sunny that led him to blackout the photos... with how it comes up on the beach in Headspace it seems like it was almost an involuntary thing . . ...Just some musings lol,10
>!Nah omori was intentional, in one route where you take back the memory book but hold onto it, you wake up to find all the pictures scribbled out anyway, sunny never conciously does it!<,10
I think it was made pretty clear that OMORI and SUNNY are one in the same. OMORI is the reaction of grief and guilt to >!Maris death!< which is shown through >!The battle between SUNNY and OMORI where he is consistently blamed and made to feel like it’s his own fault!< I believe OMORI is the personification of SUNNYS guilt and grief. That is the reason you unlock “overcome”.,2
Basil  is literally the nicest character in omori, he was put through the worst damn things and didn't snap once,45
Literally me fr,-7
I mean the plot of the game wouldn’t have played out like it did if that was true lol,3
It's a sunny character study, that's what headspace is, we got to know his friends from his perspective lmao. Figuring out what sunny is thinking is a big part of the game that is hidden by his role as a silent protag, also it is annoying that if sunny leaves, basil dies. Canon sunny likes basil enough as evidenced by their childhood memories and dynamic, however, the game makes it palpable how unsettling it is at the end of the day, who's perspective should I look through? Basil is annoying so not them,8
but even that is weird because Sunny wants to help Basil, he doesn't put all the blame on him, and feels guilt for abandoning him, and still considers him the most important person of his life besides Mari, there must have been some  misinterpretation of his mindset if by putting yourself into his shoes... you hate Basil that much. Maybe it's Omori's shoes, but even Omori... still wants an happy slice of life with all his friends, Basil included. Sunny just hates to remember what he and Basil did, not Basil himself, he feels anxiety near Basil because that's what it reminds him, Basil knows everything and that makes their interraction uncomfortable.. . . Heck, Sunny jumps in the lake, goes to the bathroom, to Basil's room, to Basil's hospidal room, the last ones don't sound so cool but if you know the context they mean something,1
look at this thing. He is utterly puntable,-1
She's the girl who inspired that one Undertale enemy I'm pretty sure,15
>>!Sunny made a concious decision not to call for help. The reason being a fear of consequences. This is NOT okay.!<  . >  . >>!He literally prioritizes himself over Maris literal life.!<. . >!Fair. Sunny's actions to not call for help immediately is definitely wrong.  Despite this, if Basil was straight up not there to hang Mari, I think it's still unknown what he would ultimately do. I think it's still possible that he ends up just telling the truth, but it's also possible that he just finds another way to fake it. It certainly wouldn't just resolve the issue, but it would make the possibility of a better ending more likely where he actually calls for help.!<. . >>!They point at dissociation and pretend that this somehow means Sunny has nothing to do with the cover-up, even though his state did neither prevent him from realizing that it was a horrible thing to do nor did it stop him from feeling relieve at the prospect of escaping the blame.!<. . >!I agree that he was involved with the coverup in the sense that he was a bystander that could have stopped the situation but he didn't directly help with the cover up assuming that the captions are right and he just "stared at leaves" the whole time.

Even if his thought process is that he can't tell the truth and can't ask for help in the moment, Basil is the one that acts on it and Sunny just follows along. That's far from ethically right but it certainly wouldn't make him worse than Basil.!<. . >!It's also heavily implied that he told his father the truth with the "no son of mine" quote, and assuming that's true, I think it would be more likely for Sunny to do the right thing of getting help in the moment had Basil not been there (but that's just speculation).!<. . >>!Context of this is a psychotic break. Basil meant to attack 'Something', not Sunny.!<  . >  . >>!It's openly stated that he meant to push her.!<. . >!Yes, but not KILL her. He was mad in the moment and acted upon his emotions. It's still really fd up that he did it but not to the same degree of actually trying to kill Sunny even if it is a psychotic break. The argument could be made that Basil didn't really see a literal something but was using the arbitrary concept of "something else killed Mari" to justify intentionally killing Sunny because he would be killing "something" instead of Sunny. He could also have been saying "something behind you" in order to lure Sunny into looking the other way so that he could kill him. It is definitely possible that Basil intentionally wanted to murder Sunny, but it is extremely unlikely that Sunny actually wanted to kill Mari.!<. . >>!Sunny can go outside.

It's definitely hard to gauge how much each character suffers since a lot of the details are missing and kind of assumed from how they live in the present.

I have never seen anybody say 'Basil did nothing wrong', or anything similar though.. . And it's not like the original post is implying that, either.. . Sunny, on the other hand, gets absolutely whitewashed, or even victimized.. . If there is any character this message should be adressed to, it's Sunny.,2
jesus christ i knew about the razor cookie but didn’t know it was cause of that,2
Just because you did it to help someone does not mean it's good. Especially covering up a murder.,0
Yeah it was either that or you, I figured no one could’ve seen my comment that fast but sorry for ”accusing” you x),-3
Blue one I think, I can’t remember it’s been a while. I wanted to figure it out on my own but I’ll probably look up a guide just so I can keep playing the game,1

Well he kinda did >!he tried to kill himself!< after all.,29
I simply hate watermelons,5
Ackshually, Sunny's not a silent protag, >!in the good ending, he says "guys I have something to tell you"!< so that means he does actually speak in the game and thus isn't silent ☝️🤓,3

I don't want to get into a big Basil morality debate, but Sunny did not intend to kill Mari. Basil intended to frame Mari's death as a suicide.,2
Yeah, it was pretty shocking to me that it was because of this,2
I disagree, he probably saved sunny's entire future.,2
You're ignoring the context of Basils psyhosis though.,1
You definitely should! You're extremely close to where things get crazy,1
I thought they did, since omori was formed shortly after the issue which was around the same time the incident with the photos happened, since it also lines up with how sunny copes with stuff (with how he suppresses everything to the point of removing doors from his perception of reality),1
I mean that he didn't for example (as far as we know) do anything to aubrey even after she bullied him for 4 years for a pretty goofy reason,27
This turned into PCM pretty quickly,1
You are acting like the only thing Sunny did was pushing Mari.,1
By committing a crime.,0
I'm inclined to think it was the formative stages of what omori was to become, before sunny "forgot himself",7
goofy reason? but weren't the photos not only pictures but also great memories with friend group where Mari and everyone else was alive,happy and togeder?????,8
Yes, he shares some responsibility for the framing. But it was Basil's idea.,2
The law is rarely justice.,2
Yes, bullying basil because of scribbling the photos for a lot of time is a pos attitude. Just ignoring him completely would've been enough.,14
Still, bullying someone for 4 years just for that is a bit long,10
Oh yeah, and that warrants nonstop bullying and physical violence for years /s,2
Why should I care about whose idea it was?. . Sunny did nothing to stop it. The opposite. He actively contributed.. . And he has a motive.. . And unlike Basil, he was fully aware that Maris death was his fault.. . This leads me to the conclusion that Sunny did so intentionally.. . And that is not even considering that Sunny made not even the slightest effort to help Mari - his refusal to call for help was a conscious decision.. . He was afraid of consequences.. . He prioritized himself over Maris life.. . And that alone is imho worse than anything Basil did.,1
I call bullshit, he might have saved Sunny's future, but in doing that he hid evidence of a murder. Not innocent.,1
I agree with you,1
So Basil gets a pass because he was in shock, but Sunny doesn't? How does that make sense?,3
So you would have let your best friend's life get ruined... Basil isn't the bad one here.,1
Where did I imply that Basil gets a pass?. . It's not like I said that what he did was justified.. . All I said was that Sunny imho did worse in this situation, not that Basil did nothing wrong.,1
I'm not saying he's evil, he's just not good either. He's in a grey area. And you seem to be ignoring the point that Basil literally hid evidence for a murder.,1
The coverup was worse than the stairs, and that was Basil's idea and he was the one primarily doing it.,2
Basil is not in a grey area at all, literally everything he did is justified. He is the nicest character in the game and the best friend anyone could have.,1
I disagree.. . Pushing someone down the stairs, consciously refusing to call an ambulance, and then making it look like suicide is worse than the cover-up alone.. . The push alone would be easy to forgive, if he actually had called an ambulance, but he actively redused to do that.. . Additionally, while the method was atrocous, at least Basils motivation was justified.. . The same cannot be said for Sunny.,1
Yes, and hid evidence for A FUCKING MURDER! Ii'm not saying he isn't nice, but he isn't innocent, because he comitted a crime!,1
> consciously refusing to call an ambulance. . [citation needed],2
Manslaughter is not murder. He is innocent because he didn't do anything wrong morally.,1
>\[citation needed\]. . Here you go:. . >Photo of Guilt  . >  . >***You want to scream for help, but you're afraid...*** you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? There's no way you can tell them the truth. ***Who would be able to forgive him?*** Who would believe... that it was... an accident?. . Not sure how else I'm supposed to interpret this.. . It's grossly neglicient.,1
Because hanging a dead body to cover up "manslaughter" is morally right.,1
> Not sure how else I'm supposed to interpret this.. . As being from Basil's perspective? Note that it's "Who would be able to forgive ***him***?".,2
Not doing that would only have hurt everyone even more. So yes, it is morally right.,1
The descriptions are consistently from Sunnys perspective, yet you suggest a random shift in POV for no appearant reason.. . Like, look, Basil doesn't even know it was Sunny to begin with:. . >***When something killed MARI...***  . >  . >*When something ruined all my photos...*  . >  . >*I didn't say anything...*  . >  . >*I didn't want people to think it was you, SUNNY.*  . >  . >*SUNNY... SUNNY wouldn't... do something like that.*. . *Sunny* says it was an accident. . . Meanwhile *Basil* fails to comprehend that it was Sunnys fault to begin with, not even as an accident.,1
How would it even hurt everyone even more?,1
> yet you suggest a random shift in POV for no appearant reason.. . Why else would the text refer to Sunny as "him"?. . > Like, look, Basil doesn't even know it was Sunny to begin with:. . Very debatable. It is very plausible he is just in denial.,2
Because sunny would go to fucking jail?,1
>Why else would the text refer to Sunny as "him"?. . Because it is Reported Speech:. . >  you mumble to yourself... . . The narrator reports something Sunny mumbled to himself.. . Within reported speech there is a shift in pronouns. First-person-pronouns are changed to third-person-pronouns.. . Here's for better understanding:. . Direct speech: '*Who would be able to forgive me?'*. . Reported Speech: Who would be able to forgive him?. . It can't be direct speech, since in that case it would have quotation marks.. . &#x200B;. . Now granted, the sentence would still look the same even if it was Basils POV, but in context of the other descriptions consistently relaying Sunnys perspective, it's safe to assume that this one is Sunnys POV, too.. . &#x200B;. .  . . >Very debatable. It is very plausible he is just in denial.. . I don't see how. All evidence points to what I said, and nothing to this conclusion.. . You have to take authorial intent into consideration when OMOCAT puts lines such as this into the game.,2
He was 12,1
> Within reported speech there is a shift in pronouns. First-person-pronouns are changed to third-person-pronouns.. . Why isn't it changed to "Who would be able to forgive you?". . >  I don't see how. All evidence points to what I said, and nothing to this conclusion.. . > You have to take authorial intent into consideration when OMOCAT puts lines such as this into the game.. . We don't know what Omocat's intent was. All we have is a few lines that read to me like he is in denial and knows deep down that Sunny did it.,1
Juvenile detention.,1
>Why isn't it changed to "Who would be able to forgive you?". . Because it'd be unclear wether this is an internal train-of-thought or something that has been said out loud.. . The change in pronoums signifies that this is not an internal thought, but something the character in question - Sunny - said out loud.. . >We don't know what Omocat's intent was. All we have is a few lines that read to me like he is in denial and knows deep down that Sunny did it.. . No offense, but I honestly do not get at all how you reach that conclusion.. . Could you explain why think this?,1
> Because it'd be unclear wether this is an internal train-of-thought or something that has been said out loud.. > . > . > . > The change in pronoums signifies that this is not an internal thought, but something the character in question - Sunny - said out loud.. . No it doesn't. It doesn't do that at all. I don't see why you think it does.. . > Could you explain why think this?. . Because his dialogue on the matter reads very much as if he's trying to convince himself.. . Also it really damages the themes of the game if Basil is insane and doesn't know what's real and what's not.,1
>Because his dialogue on the matter reads very much as if he's trying to convince himself.. . I very, very strongly disagree. His dialogue reads to me as if he wouldn't have done jackshit if not for his psychosis.. . But I guess that's a matter of interpretation.. . >Also it really damages the themes of the game if Basil is insane and doesn't know what's real and what's not.. . . Like, that is what is actually implied.. . Are you seriously telling me to just ignore that?. . Like, why?. . That's the entire point of his character.. . A genuinly insane person whose actions are based on exactly that.,1
> That's the entire point of his character.. > . > . > . > A genuinly insane person whose actions are based on exactly that.. . See if that's the case Omori turns into an entirely different story. It's not about owning up to the truth and seeking forgiveness, it's about getting mental health treatment for someone delusional enough to be a danger to themselves and others. And it clearly isn't that.,1
Not sure how so, but I guess that's fair.. . That's just the way I always felt about Basil.. . Sunny and Basil are completely different characters, and I fail to see why they'd have to share the exact same struggle.. . To me, they very clearly represent two completely different issues.. . I guess it's a matter of interpretation and perspective.. . But I think considering both of their roles to be the same to be a huge mistake.,1

He got no one but kel,3
Sunny and basil were also really good friends and hero cares about basil as well.,4
Ye but well sunny is kimda afraid of basil becouse >!something and he kimda reminds him of the truth(i think)!< and hero is in collage and it was that time where aubrey was really angry at basil for >!"Ruining" the photo album!< so he only got kel,2
In the true good ending they confess the truth and their somethings fade away so they’re not afraid of each other in the end and they also smile at each other. From my pov sunny kel basil and aubrey all of them should be together as hero is in college they will help each other out.,2
Ye thats what i waa talking a bout he ia afraid of something and basils somrthing migth remind him of that maybe but here is the thing aubrey was angry at basil so kel was angry at aubrey and sunny didnt go outside for >!4years!< si thats why basil only had kel,2
Also please use spoiler i can teach you hiw if you dont know how,2

It’s because Aubrey,Kel and hero are chasing Sunny with pitchforks and torches,625

*SUNNY DID NOT FUCKING SUCCUMB*,14
I once saw another Guy in another omori youtube video comment section Who has calculated the height of The >!forbidden hospital building!< by using >!average 16 your old e boy weight And The falling speed of sunny!<,11
sunny's mom is just fucking sending it,10
Someone should write a one shot fic, where the car actually crashes,8
the car: i am retribution ,8
Don't worry guys Omocat's gonna fix it. By adding more poles,9
sunny's mom Irl [,7
Maybe he did something illegal and the cops are chasing him down after he called his getaway driver,6
Sunny: ?!. . Sunny’s mom: You aren’t the only one who’s a bit suicidal sweetie.,6
Mom, I want to see Mari,6
Further proof sunny has shitty parents,12
And this is the good ending…,5
he actually in a train,4
r/theydidthemonstermath,4
Plot twist: it's actually a small plane and Sunny's mom is just flying it really low,4
"NOT FAST ENOUGH HIT THE FUCKING S O U N D B A R R I E R",4
Even if the car crashes, Sunny can survive by just breathing.,4
So either faraway town (or whatever it was called it’s been a while since i played it) is actually in the dead center of los angeles and it just looks really suburban or sunny’s mom is a fucking maniac.,3
reminds me of the comment that calculated how high a building should be for a person that falls at terminal velocity to have enough time for my time to finish,3
do you really think that the woman that let her paranoid child alone in the house stabbing people out there for 3 days is going to worry about speed limit?,3
Don't worry there just going to visit Mari,3

kowalski, ANALYSIS!,2
There are still some iffy assumptions here.. . How many frames in a second?  One minimum is 24 frames, which means one pole a second, not 1.25 seconds.. . On the other hand, with 60 fps, that 24 is way less than a second.. . Or with 12 fps, it's a pole every two seconds.,2

Not to mention, they probably looked up the highest speed limit in the US. 85mph is pretty rare, unless you're on some deep south country roads, so more than likely they were going 65-70mph. It's even less likely that they're going 85mph because if you're taking an interstate that has 75-80 as the speed limit (which is much more common), it doesn't have any landline poles.. . DEBUNKED,2

Sunny would say “Nope.”. Basil would say: “Um, Kel, I think you’re wrong...”. And Mari would smile and say: “Wow! I didn’t know this!! It’s completely true, Kel! You’re definitely right!!”,161
I fucked your mom, shitlips,301
sunny: "ok",69
Basil: Well Kel I think I am smart enough to be able to come up with a work around  for such restrictions and still create a working sentence. How was that Sunny?. . Snuuy: Basil you just used the letter ***A*** multiple times.. . Basil: Shit.,57

I find it completely plausible that Basil has a genuine fear of the Pacer test,411
fuck this test,99
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.,74
I would litterally kill to have this dynamic with someone. I would also kill anyone who dares to disagree with this.,33
Vent? Like in .... Among Us?,115
Basil doesn't really seem like the type to complain much imo. He seems like a sweet bean who'd try to see the best in everything. . . It kinda feels more likely that Kel or Aubrey might have an endless list of complaints that Sunny just sits there and doesn't mind listening for a bit.,37
Vents? Sounds sus.,29
Basil just vent that's pretty SUS 😳😳. . >!Mari's body was found there's two imposters Among us!<,6

No, Like in FNaF,62

I mean that’s fair, but I was referencing something Basil said in his photo album about how Sunny would listen to him vent.,27
What if he never has anything to complain about because he's always already told it to Sunny or is forcing it out with toxic positivity,23
im pretty sure they all know sunny is like that, even aubrey said that he didnt mind listening to her problems,7

[Artist ](). . It’s supposed to be art post but there’s Kel so:. . **All Kel Meme are Canon**. . . ***And Sunburn is Canon***,106
This is canon. We can stop the shipping wars now.,31
i stan sunburnt tan like, i cant decide who i ship with sunny, kel or aubrey? so like why not both?,21
Kel is carrying the squad in more ways than one I see,19
now do Aubrey lifting Suntan,17
Kel literally supporting the ship.,14
I believe this is symbolic of the burden of having to deal with those two cute dorks.,12
Kel best boy!,11
Dude, respect to Kel. It must take A LOT of force to lift two people on top of each other, especially for someone his age. Not to mention the balance needed so that they don’t just sloppily fall off his hands.,11
Kel is the /foundation/ of every ship, and the sooner we all realise that the better,6
The right side of Kel's brain: damn these thighs are soft as hell even though they are heavy. . The left side: burgir. . Edit: I just realized what Sunny is looking at,6
Why wasn't he this strong during the battles,5
This is adorable artwork!,5
Talk about supporting a ship,5
Sunburn happens. Kel makes it canon,5
Hey, this is good workout material. . . >!Also, I want to say Kel is best wingman, but then I remember the dude cockblocked sunny during the treehouse scene. I got so frustrated that time XD!<,5
Kel starring as the main mvp for convincing Sunny to leave his house and somewhat making the ship possible in the first place,4
Sunny is like "don't blame me".,4
It's more like kel lifting all of omori amirite. . &#x200B;. . I'll go now.,4
Me a sunflower shipper: kel is strong i-,3
My brain is trying to process this,5
Why do everyone draws Aubrey with bandages in her legs? I cant recall seeing her legs at any point of the game,3

Now Basil defying logic to lift all of them at once.,162
**Stronk**,44
Now we're thinking with portals!,46
I mean Sunburn was already canon but this is even more canon now.,35
Which means THERE IS MULTIPLE TIMELINES OF SUNBURN. . KEL BROKE THE UNIVERSE HE STRONGER THAN GOKU. THE CANON CANON FRUIT. . shit my weeb instincts kicking in,3
Until Omocat starts World War Three by saying that Omori 2 is going to have one ship between Suntan, Sunburn, Sunflower. . Yes nukes will be used,3
I've been trying to figure out it I prefer sunburn or suntan, now I've finally realised thanks to this comment that I like *ALL OF THEM.*,20
I mean I feel like kel was the first to greet the new neighbors which means he would have led to hero and mari meeting,3
B O T H, B O T H  I S  G O O D,2

dont they comment on an alt,3
Shut the funk up,4
The entry in the lost library when Sunny fell onto Aubrey’s shoulder in the car mentions “the light tinge of tomorrow’s sunburn”,9
I don't remember why, all I know is Sunflower is Sunny x Basil, Suntan is Sunny x Kel, and Sunburn is Sunny x Aubrey,4
I wonder is Aubrey still wants that after what happend,2

i could play this,. . in an unironic way, . . fully fleshed out could play this,6
You play as a boy that, over the course of a fantastical adventure, learns that he is nothing more than a caricature of a real boy in someone else’s mind. That he is a disposable commodity in his friends’ party, dispensing comic relief at best, or Kel nukes at worst.,6

I’m gonna be honest here, but unpopular option: I don’t like Kel. He reminds me a lot of my ‘best’ friend growing up who was pretty gross and crass. And I don’t like basketball people! I much prefer Aubrey and her crowd.,2

FR I LOVE KEL I BREATH KEL,9
I cannot see him go into any strong anger, his best attempts are with Aubrey when she bully Basil. So pushing Hero isn't likely to happen,10
An Omori spinoff about Kel’s life after the incident would kick so much ass.. . No, I’m not biased.,27
Happy cake day! ,3
You really couldn’t have worded that any worse,3
GET KEL’D! ,2
 >!(Start running, for he approaches.)!<,13
. . Jarvis, somebody on the internet disagrees with my opinion. You and I both know that is a cardinal sin. Send them either photo of my genitalia or their IP address, then fill up their inbox with death threats. That oughta teach them not ti have an opinion not like mine.,12
you just made 90% of r/OMORI real angry,2

You got 20 DOLLAR,13
>!Omori's 2023 sequel, which follows the life of the convict Hero following the murder of Sunny Suzuki after his confession!<,80
Her,10
Yes,23
Which is why it is canon,22
Apple pool ,13
Aubrey foot ,14
not allowed it is for me only i crafted it with my own hansddss,7
I wouldn't have it any other way. No problem.,20
There's a high probability that it happens due to his... pardon my language, due to his stupidity.,13
Y E S! WE NEED A DLC/SEQUEL OR SOMETHING,8
a prequel probably, where we follow Kel right before the incident, there are different “endings” but it all still leads to the same thing ,5
oh really?. . >!Welcome to Orange Space, you've been violating rule 2 as long as you can remember!<,3
The fact that I can actually imagine this just makes me angry at the possibility of a ruined ending ,40
Her,7
apple juice ,12
,17
In other words : YOU CANT,3
I know a sequel would kinda ruin the game’s open ending, but like, could I not have just the tiniest glimpse into what life is like after the Good and Bad endings? Could I have a small morsel? A scrap? A teensy little peak? Maybe even a doodle or singular sentence by any of the developers?,20
>!Omori 3: Aubrey is sent to jail as a product of the hooligan gang misdoings, including the death of Basil after a drug selling dispute!<,48
Orange juice ,11
Waht if…it takes place after the most recent ending you got and goes from there.. (Example) : If OYASUMI, then Basil story now,9
~~This one made me laugh~~ NOOO! SHE WAS BABY,25
>!Basil, we need to cook!<,20
WELCOME TO JAIL. YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING HERE FOR AS LONG AS YOU CAN REMEMBER,14
Orange Joe,12
Hell yeah. I don’t really want an Omori sequel, but if omocat’s going to add a new addition to the universe, I think the best places to start are either post-bad ending Basil and post-good/true ending Sunny.,10

you can really tell who has actually had siblings when it comes to omori art lol,26
Did anyone else think kel was wearing a rec room shirt,9

Kel and Hero are too good for this world,5
knowing how classrooms are someone is going to moan right about.... now,7
u/kewlbeqns do you agree with kel from the hit indie game OMORI?,5
TWO YARDS OF LEATHER,5
I see no need to "hear you out" you are simply correct,3
smn smn canon kel,3
Aka, he forgot to do his homework for professor Hero,2
Awww this is precious!,2
Damn, Kel is me frfr ,1
Why can't I have a younger brother like that,1
not the warrior cats shirt ahahahahaha,1
He's kind of amazing, as the game leads you to believe.. . Although he will die of internal damage when a third of the slides are done.,1
So his brother is older than him, the would not be I. The same class,1
: Kel, why are you doing this?. . : Just wait until we get to the 1,000th slide!. . ,1
i don’t know where to put this but i feel like kel would claim he’s not gay and then unironically kiss the homies goodnight,1
: K-kel... Why?. . : GOOD QUESTION! It will be answered in the 100th slide!. . ,308
: well, why's there 200 slides???,20
only 200 slides?,1
: dont hurt me or hurt hero!,18
He has arrived.,14
the og,18
i would do that for my brother tbh,4
That’s not the artist, that’s someone’s Pinterest board. Here’s the real source: . . If you’re going to repost someone’s art, please make sure you’re crediting the right person.,50
Yes I do,3

: WAIT, THERE'S OVER 100 SLIDES!?,115

: well…      :it was going to be over 500.   : But I couldn’t get enough paper for the test,22
what reverse image site did you use?  the link i provided was the only thing that i could find haha,7
Eh, he tried his best,6
:Mine has 500,117
 200 hundred Sunny. You gotta pay attention cuz I WILL be quizzing you all on this later.,72
 : NOT AS MUCH AS I OHOHOHOHO-  : O U T .,24
: also, please dont talk about that one photo of me in a crop top...,21
I also couldn’t find any results thru reverse image searches (they’re always finicky at best), I just found it by looking up the Pinterest description (“omori meme redraw”); I just got lucky that the reposter copied the original’s caption. Generally if you don’t know the artist I’d recommend just asking in your post title, usually someone in the comments will know,10
i'm a female, but thank you,7
: that's way worse, also >!i though you died 4 years ago!<,92
: If you do a quiz on that I'm >!killing you a second time!<,85

: You got something you want to say Basil?. . : No it's just, why 200 slides?. . : Because the Powerpoint could only fit 200 at a  time!,14

i aint letting this fandom die like if this fandoms about to die, ill sit in a random cave painting omori memes on a wall so future geologists can find it,723
I mean what do you expect? It happens to most games that don't get consistent updates and That's okay.,767
do people stop being fans of things they like..?. . I can understand not talking about it as much, but what kind of question is "Anyone still an Omori fan in 2025", like duh of course we still like omori,350
i finished this game a week ago lol and it was the best i played in my life this game is a masterpiece,168
Absolutely not. Omori will always have a place in my heart. infact I'm working on a Shared Dream AU fanfiction with 20 chapters! its called Omori Nevermore and you can find it [Here on Wattpad.](),57
No? A game/series being old doesn’t suddenly make fandoms die. Especially one on the size of the Omori fandom which is an extremely popular and loved Indie game that everyone knows.,40
,32
As someone who has seen a similar thing in other communities: Most fandoms around narrative-focused games, that don't get regular updates post-release, fizzle out eventually. There's just not really anything left to discuss about the game as it's a finished piece of art so it's natural that people lose interest in being an active part of the community, especially 5 years after release.. While it's a bit sad, it's a phase every fandom goes through eventually.. . TL:DR, people move on to other interests if there's nothing left to talk about regarding a piece of media.,34
i mean its a one-off game from 4 years ago, so kinda yeah.,91
I just finished the game weeks ago and am in the same kinda rut you are in. Lots of content from 2021-2023. Must’ve been its Golden age.. . At least the subreddits kinda active, let’s plays are still happening, places like Wplace had tons of characters etc. In retrospect, I’ve seen a ton of Basil PFPs.. . It could be worse. I’ve seen deader fandoms.,21
No matter if the fandom is dying or not I will forever wear my Omori tattoo proudly, sitting next to all the plushies and looking at the aniversary pictures. This game will live rent free in my head as long as it can!,23
This isn't based on any scientific research but I don't believe that Fandoms actually "die". The player count may drop, this subreddit may lose participants and social media may not highlight this game in the future. That doesn't mean that anything died, just became less relevant. . . Omori lives within me. Within my memories. Within your memories. Unless everyone truly forgets about this game, the Fandom will never "die". Even if it were the case that everyone forgot about it, new players will always have access to it. If access to the game is restricted and all of the people who experienced it are long past, you may argue that the Fandom died. . . To say that the Fandom is dying, dead, or will be dead, is also to assume that history can die. Knowledge can be destroyed, hidden, or forgotten but in a metaphysical sense, it is never able to "die". . . One way that we can combat the erosion of time is to uphold our responsibility of documenting its past. Talking about this game, sharing it with others, and reflecting on our relationships with it and with others. . . I wrote this post as a way to document that we are here and will not let this Fandom "die" because it lives within us and can be preserved and passed down. . . Sorry for the long post.,14
no i hate omori mwahahahaha im evil,21
i will keep this fandom alive, even if only in my heart. plus i plan to have stuff to post in the subreddit soon,8
Been here since 2020, still loving it,8
I’m here too I’ve beaten it 4 time this year alone,7
I finished the game a month ago and cried my eyes out. Won’t forget it anytime soon.,8
It’s been almost 5 years since it first dropped, things like this tend to come and go in terms of popular talk after awhile, with a niche fan base still being retained (aka us!!),6
Land of the Lustrous on the desktop 👀. . ,7
It's not that the fandom is dead, it's just that there's nothing to talk about. There are fans, but they're not TALKING about anything because there's nothing TO talk about,3
Just finished this week lol. I’m currently going through a bunch of fan made content like watching a playthrough of autumn break. (I got the game on ps5 so no mods),3
Im here, and getting my start guide + artbook from my bday in a few days!,3
i love this game with all my heart,3
People love the game and probably always will, the “fandom” on the other hand….id put them in similar box to mha with the weird ships and twink worship. . . Someone should say it so why not. Rev up them downvotes to prove my point,3
I wouldn't say dead. It's just past its prime. When there's no new content being released, there really isn't much to talk about or discuss that hasn't been said already when it was a hot topic.. . Just like DDLC, the fandom is still there, but it's mostly fanart. Nothing wrong with that, it's just the natural cycle of games and fandoms, especially with much smaller fanbases.,3
My love for omori may sadly fade but it shall always hold a special place in my heart,3
I'll always be a fan, but not always active in the fan*dom*,3
I still happily play it and sleep with Sunny and Basil plushies. I don't make any fan content on it tho ,3
,6
. . People are still playing, not dead yet.,5
Time to move to the deltarune fandom 💔✌️,2
I just played and beat Omori for the first time last week. I've never heard of it before last month and now I'm a new fan of the game. I've been recommending it to my friends now,2
I just started replaying the game, and I’ve been a fan since 2021. It’s been a big part of my life, ups and downs, and I’ll never be able to forget it. I’ll be a fan of this game till I die.,2
Omori fandom isn’t dead,2
Omori is a quality visual novel with interactive contents. The gameplay is interesting, with a satisfying level of reward curve for certain mini-games. The OST has hits and misses. I personally think Bo En’s feature carries the soundtrack and I think that it’s a useful mechanic in keeping Western Japanese language enthusiasts uninterested in the game. . I personally haven’t completed the full omori game, and I’ve not explored the fantastical extra content of >!ditching Kel!<. . The fact that there’s multiple covers of It Means Everything and World’s End Valentine make it clear the fandom had a large audience. . I guess my question would be: is Omori worth sharing in <current year>? It certainly hasn’t helped us make friends.,2
yes, omori is dying, the only way to revive it would be adding some route that you can go killing everyone and call it the snowgrave route. Maybe it could trigger if you forced the player to stay inside instead lf going outside. but idk,2
ME MEEMEMEMEME I LOVE OMORI,2
I sell some omori fanart at conventions and it’s some of my most popular stuff! Beats things like frieren and dungeon meshi, even,2
I joined this year :0,2
Saying that a game or its fandom is dead is the worst lie you can tell yourself. As long as there is a group of people who enjoy, remember, or discuss a game, it's never truly dead.,2
Its funny how the manga is currently ongoing but its so hard for anyone to read it outside of japan,2
Whats land of the lustrous doing on your desktop,2
I am playing today for the first time...trying to do a good ending, wish me luck please ;-;,2
i just got into omori like a week ago so ill be here for awhile 🫡,2
I make drawings of sunny till this day, here's one of them. . . . (If you think its AI, it isn't, I'm a ibis paint user and I use a lot effects, most of the time being for the colors, and I have the speed paint of it, as a artist that is way too proud I would never steal art, that is for lazy people),2
Wdym? I posted a tiktok asking if I should play omori and it went viral. I think we have fans,2
Earthbound fans survive without any type of news for 30 years, Omori fans can survive some decade without content...,2
i recently joined the omori fandom a few months ago, finally decided to test it out, and holy shit. calling it a masterpiece is a literal understatement. unfortunately, it seems all the fans aren't as hyped anymore. hoping to find a few here!,2
I've been seeing more Omori fans lately ngl,2
I deliberately waited until the hype died down to play it. I don’t like playing shit when it’s popular and trendy. It’s never too late to play any game. r/patientgamers,2
I mean I’ll always have a place in my heart for omori but I’m not always gonna love the games and shit I loved when I was 13,2
Oh, I just came across this sub randomly. Good timing, I was planning on learning Korean about this game because ive heard a lot about it and it seems pretty interesting. So... I guess I could be a new recruit in this fandom...? Idk,2
I hop on GMod and play the Blackspace variant of Where we used to play and don’t talk to anyone when I’m feeling this,2
Please don’t let this game die more people need to play it,2
I WILL NEVER FORGOT OMORI. ,2
i’ve been a fan of omori since launch, and tbh it sucks how it got slept on in 2025. had a really popular account in the brazilian omori fandom, lots of ppl still remember me. feel super nostalgic thinking about those times. was just a kid back then, and have such good memories bc of my tiktok and my famous discord server. really wish it could get the hype it had in 2021, omori is a masterpiece :(,2
I just watched the end of it last night and wow,2
no bro i will ALWAYS be an omori fan,2
Nah, in 2 years Omori will become that one fandom with three surviving fans😭🙏,2
Nah people make mods to omori 4 times a month,2
i actually finished omori this summer and it was probably the best story game i have ever played lol,i will probably die on a hill saying omori is the best story game i've every played,2
I just finished it :p,2
IT AINT DEAD NOT UNTIL MY GODDAMN MOD IS DONE. . Cheeky plug I am looking for people to help with my omori mod: eg artists, musicians, developers,2
Why is there a Land of The Lustrous Icon?,1
I played it earlier this year. . I ain't letting the fandom die when I just got into it!,1
The channel Euro Brady is playing it at the moment and commenting on the characters psychology and talking about therapy-stuff in in the context of Omori (Brady's a therapist). There are already 10 parts out and he's not even through Sweethearts castle. Seeing someone with a new view point playing it and reading the comments under it, makes it feel pretty alive to me. Can only highly recommend it.,1
Yeah,1
this fandom won’t die till my fanfic is done. . . then it can go to hell,1
...        ❤️Me.,1
I played it for the first time just a couple of weeks ago.,1
I will never forget about this game. I have merch all over my house & wear my Basil sweater often 🩷,1
Kel.,1
I loved Omori until they stopped updating on steam so I can’t play it on my Mac :( I have posted several times trying to see if there is a way to get this fixed and…nothing,1
yes,1
i kinda got outa my omori phase in 2023. prolly cuz they removed it from xbox,1
I dunno I see people posting a lot, it’s mostly fan content though it’s not as based around the game itself as it used to be, it’s very much like the Undertale fandom in that regard,1
Me,1
I really like Omori.,1
Nope.  In fact, I'm eagerly awaiting a post-canon mod to update so I can have even more Omori.,1
I mean, it's been like a year since I last played the game, but I still love it.,1
I only just joined the fandom last month! I dont know how I managed to avoid spoilers for 5 years but.. I can now say Omori is one of my favourite games 💕,1
Not in my opinion, it's normal for a fandom to slow down after a while, that's not the same as the fandom dying.,1
not letting this fandom die.,1
I played it for the first time this year and finished it about two weeks ago 😊 so it’s not completely dead yet,1
what? i'm pretty sure it's not. I stll recieve a good amount of omori content on my fyp in tiktok, there are a lot of people on the internet with omori pfps and those who just talks about/mentions this game. In my opinion it's more than alive,1
I’d like to do a video going over every difference between the manga and the game if it hasn’t been done yet. At least starting with the first chapter as its own video. Cause there’s already an essays worth of changes in it.,1
It will be lively again once Rainy Mari drops its demo,1
I'm glad tbh. Hopefully there could be a big announcement in the future causing a reboot,1
I am a new Omori fan. I played the game for the first time last month and I immediately got hooked.,1
I LIVE AND BREATHE OMORI,1
Hell no! I love this game and everything surrounding it and don’t see myself getting bored of it anytime soon.,1
I swear this game came out like a year ago 💀,1
me! I love omori still! and my gf is replaying it on steam deck so that's also something. Regardless of dead or alive we can still love the game, no?,1
In a ditch.,1
I played back in 2021 and I still like omori. probably will make a few animatics here and there, just got really busy with life. Lowkey I only was able to make “content” back then because of the pandemic/graduating high school which resulted in a special blend of free time/being stuck inside. It could be your own perspective changing as you grow older, for me I feel becoming an adult has made me less involved in any fandom simply because of time.,1
Nah I’m still here, plus my friend who doesn’t use reddit!!,1
It’s probably because the fandom has mostly run out of conversation topics to discuss, that’s why it seems quiet,1
Definitely not. I still see plenty of content, just not as much as like- 2021. . . It’s not as overbearing as before, with edits and walkthroughs being posted everyday, but it’s definitely still afloat and doing fine. Hell it stays profitable, clearly. . . I’d say it’s staying pretty steady for now.,1
Me I'm never leavin!,1
we will never die! never die!,1
I just got my first tattoo and its a massive omori leg piece,1
I played Omori last year, me and my brother agreed we wait a few years than play the game again cause it’s beautiful,1
We will get a surge of popularity when rainy mari comes out, but otherwise the game is still decently popular, I still recommend it to people.,1
NEVER. . ,1
Oh now that you mentioned it, I remember this sub being way more active than it is now. . Anyone remember when we used to spam the custom Omori stickers?,1
Have you see the psychologist playing Omori?,1
A youtuber I found via omori named Whiz gaming recently played the whole thing, it got a ton of love and brought back my love for the game for a while. I'd definitely recommend watching his playthrough since you've beaten the game,1
WE'RE STILL HERE!,1
. . My contribution to the cause,1
Ain't no way am letting this fandom die.,1
I'm yet to play it. It let it rot on my desktop for awhile to aquire that winw taste,1
I don't think you ever stop being a fan of something you utterly love. I sure won't.,1
Still my favorite game. 🖤,1
What do you mean bro has a Land of the Lustrous desktop application. What does it even do? Is it a fan game?,1
Eastern fandom is still strong,1
Yah me ✋,1
One of the yters I watch is only just now doing a playthough of it and his subscriber count and member count has skyrocketed. I think we're good.,1
I have yet to beat the game but I’m slowly working on it,1
Still a fan. However I can consider this game lost media to me as OMOCAT has maintained utter silence on the console edition removal and will not re-release it. . . Love the game, hate my time being wasted getting invested in it.,1
NSO spotted 🙏BLESS🙏,1
I mean... Kinda? I don't know, I mean OMORI released about 5 years ago now and as a single player game, which it's story has already been discussed and analyzed and each one of its secrets has already been found by the community, it's not going to be as loud as it was during their first years. But even so I still love this game and I still look forward to anything made by either OMOCAT or the community, like I'm still searching for a way to buy or claim a collector's edition of the game and I'm still waiting for the release of the Rainy Mari demo, which supposedly comes out this year, as well for OMORI: The Dreamer.,1
Yes.,1
I feel like early in 2024 the fandom was very alive, then boom, by mid 2024 things slowed down,1
Land of the lustrous game??? That exists???,1
Kinda. The game is done, finished, nothing more. And the manga is just going over what we already know. . The fandom is out of its prime, but Omori is still a peak game to me. . . I don’t know if good fanfiction has come out recently tbh ao3 top kudos isn’t really the best way to find new fire literature..  The guy who made the Gang plays Omori is back though. . . And to be honest, I got real immersed in Omori, which makes it harder when there’s just nothing left to it anymore, there will never be more content to wait for.. . But I heard there’s real good mods in the works. If Undertale Yellow taught me anything, it’s not too late to revive a community.,1
We haven't >! met stairs!< yet.,1
The game stuck to me as it has elements i do really relate to. A friend and my brother who do know of the game actually even pointed out some things and it helped me to get a better gasp of my own issues. . . Im just waiting in silence for the next physical manga drop here in Europe.. . And I trying to get that said friend to play omori. They just got a laptop  this month.,1
legit started replaying the game a week ago, i miss omori so bad,1
The real question is why does your Hollow Knight need admin to open?,1
The game's always been by my side,1
it's not dead by any means, it's pretty quiet and a lot more chill than it used to be but it's definitely still around. a small fandom isn't a dead fandom,1
no way,1
Not really. I mean, sure, it's not as active as it once was, but it was kinda inevitable for Omori, a one off game, to have its fandom mellow out.,1
I wouldn't call it "dead", it still get new content from fans, but rather... relaxed on the thing,1
Fandoms never really die, they just run out of things to say,1
Still here,1
I still love this game, played it 1 week after release,1
yw,1
Me,1
I mean, a fandom doesn't just DIE. We're all still gathered here and we still have a mutual love of the game. . . So it's not getting updated. So it's not as popular as it once was. Who cares? We love Omori, so the fandom is still alive.,1
Still a huge fan myself,1
That’s okay, it’s not supposed to be a mainstream game and also people will always look back thinking fondly of Omori. I mean, Earthbound fandom for example don’t really get anything new in decades but is still well regarded by many.,1
i just got into it actually,1
I mean, people still like, lined up heavily in Omocat booth in Animecon, it's definitely not dead,1
Fym dead we still here dawg,1
yeah i love omori,1
Omori is the one game besides Cyberpunk that's EVER emotionally made me feel anything and will never change whether or not the fandom dies. Even if I have to wait another decade for more content. I'll always love it.,1
Why and how do you have houseki no kuni (land of the lustrous) as a shortcut,1
Pls don't tell me you've played the entire game in windowed mode,1
im still here, and here for a lot longer. trust me,1
I plan on getting it and playing it for the first time the next time it goes on sale on the eshop,1
Idk I still see a lot of Omori content nowadays,1
I've certainly noticed a steady decline of engagement in the fanfic-sphere. It doesn't help that I already write for a more niche part of the fandom (Headspace focus, none of the gang). As others have said, that's the curse oneshot games and other media face. A complete story was told, and a sequel just doesn't make sense.. . . The manga isn't helping as much as I'd hoped either. The direction it's being taken isn't particularly in-line with the game. ,1
It has enriched our lives forever. That’s plenty.,1
I am sure this fandom is not dead,1
Been into Omori since release. Now I'm getting a new spark watching Euro Brady play it, a therapist who has some interesting analysis—his series is ongoing!,1
Realistically? Unfortunately, OMORI is no FNAF or Undertale. The creator has a bad rep, game has a bad rep, the game itself is a 6/10 (good story, too much filler, gameplay is ok), a lot of people simply can't see the appeal, and things like OMORI tend to die out in 10 years or so if the fandom is devoted enough. Add all of this up and I honestly don't see it surviving much longer honestly.. . There will ALWAYS be fans and there will always be a fandom, even a small speck of it, but it'll slowly stop getting talked about because there is only so much content to talk about. No updates, no new games, only new merch, and thats very likely to not be enough.. . But hey at least it existed at all, its okay if it dies out imo. Nothing stays alive forever,1
I saw a ton of Omori content on place,1
Im just entering it cause i started to play it a while ago,1
I'm still heavily into it, but I suck at being alive in the fandoms, rip :(,1
Just because the hype isn't as strong for a game as it was when it was realesed, dosen't mean that people don't care about it anymore. I think that most of the game's content has been already combed to hell and back and there isn't anything new left to say about it. So yeah: people moved on and the fandom is dormant.,1
I dont think that the fandom is going to die. Its a relative small fandom but its presistant. Omori is a imo a hidden gem in the gamespace, not many ppl played it or can play it but those who played it mostly say its a one of a kind game and everybody should at least try it, thats just my opinion,1
Euro Brady who is a therapist is currently playing it on, if you want content you can check his playthrough on YouTube,1
Yes hello hai! ^^,1
Me too, it seems the more time passes the less content is made, but that’s how it goes… if the game doesn’t get any updates, people will be less active in the fandom and such. It’s really sad to see the decline of people 😭😭 . . But there will always be that select few that ARE still active ;) and for the time being, that’s the people on this sub AND discord or YouTube or wherever platform they’re on! So don’t lose hope yet :D,1
Ill play omori in a few years when i forgot most the story,1
I really really WISH I could finally play Omori, but I don't want to pirate it. :(,1
Still alive and traumatised 🗣️🔥,1
i’m doing my first playthrough rn but i’ve been stuck on the casino for like two months 😭,1
I'm still a fan and I wish they didn't remove it entirely from xbox. I still don't even know why they did it.,1
I'M HEEEERRREEEEEEE,1
I'm not in the fandom much but the game forever has a special place in my heart,1
Still one of my favorite games. Need to replay it one day.,1
Hell yeah,1
I forgot i was in this sub ngl,1
I don't think the fandom is dead by any stretch, but it's definitely not as big or relevant as it was back in 2021 - 2023, but that's just how all games go. Eventually time takes its toll and the game and community will fizzle out and most people will move on, especially when it's a game like OMORI, a singleplayer story game that doesn't get consistent updates and has basically had everything it has to offer explored. But even despite that, I don't think that any game truly "dies" outside of a few examples. The fandom will get smaller, the game will lose its relevancy to the masses, but no matter what, people will always remember the game, people will always look back on the game, people will always be able to see the legacy the game left in it's prime (whether for better or worse), and people will (probably) always make content about the game even years later. Think about Undertale, it just turned 10 years old three days ago and people still make content about it even a decade later, and that'd probably be the case even if Deltarune didn't exist. Another example is Oneshot, which also turned 10 years old last year, and yet people still talk about it as well, and it doesn't have a sequel to retain that fanbase's interest, they just stick with the game regardless.. .   . TL;DR - The fandom may be smaller than it was in it's prime, but I certainly don't think it's dead or will ever truly die.,1
Slowly been playing through over the past year, and i love it so much!,1
I still like it started a new playthrough 100 percenting it and js bought plushies bc of restock,1
headspace night,1
I just got a new Omori tattoo last month! I'm focused on other games right now but I still absolutely love Omori ❤️ one of my top 10 games!,1
How the fuck are you playing Frieren and Hoseki no Kuni??,1
I will ALWAYS be here,1
We're still here in Blackspace.....,1
Well i got 4 of my friends into the game this year so i think its just getting more popular,1
I doubt it,1
Its the same as it ever was,1
This game is like five years old, i'd hardly call it dead. To me, a fandom only dies when you bring it up and no one knows what you're talking about.,1
I AM HERE!,1
Me :D,1
I think it will happen the same thing that happened with over the garden wall, Its a piece of art that now ended, and thats okay, im happy they are not gonna add more content because the story is over now, we just gotta to appreciate and remember how it is a masterpiece from time to time,1
Honestly, I love this game but the Fandom is too young to hang out with.,1
I was still thinking of playing again soon.,1
Unrelated but whats the land of the lustrous app?,1
i just got an omori tattoo like last week,1
Never played it but it looks appealing,1
Regrettably.,1
I played this game like 2 weeks ago and had a blast.,1
Yep,1
yesssss i named my dog after sunny!!!!,1
The houseki game?!?,1
Is Omocat making more games?,1
IF THERE ARE NO OMORI FANS IT MEANS IM DEAD!!!,1
idk i haven't played since it left xbox in late 2023,1
No, i’m kind of new to the fandom since i just beat the game at the end of last month. Despite the game reaching its peak at around 2021-2023, the community definitely died down as of recent and that’s fine. Every game has to go through that.. . I’ve luckily went through the peak years without any spoilers and managed to play the game fully blind and it was an absolutely phenomenal experience.,1
I still like it,1
I actually just finished this game for the first time this year. I plan to go back and finish for every ending. . I also dragged my friend into this game, too. It was recommended to me by two of my friends. So yes, the fandom is still alive(:,1
Im here in i probably won't leave,1
Don't worry about how much content is on your feed. Just be a fan of what you like and use the search function.,1
The problem is that omori is a complete work that came out 5 years ago, there is little to discuss about the game at this point, we are just out of material, is a great game, but it has just so many content.,1
It’s randomly waking up rn ,1
ME,1
I’m here,1
MEEEEE A FAN!!!!!,1
Of course,1
If the omori fandom is dead so am I,1
I mean there is still the manga coming out so not really dead,1
I became a casual Omori fan THIS YEAR!!. . So me personally, the Omori fandom is still kicking and growing just very slowly as of now. 😅,1
The fandom was so cool when it had a lot of people :'). I miss that era,1
I’m right at the end of the game,1
Still love omori, definitely the most I’ve spent on merch for any franchise ever I think? Just quietly enjoying it as I’m not online all that much anymore :),1
I mean... There is no content to work with?,1
Not dead! Despite not being as popular as back then, there's still a bunch of people who loves this game and there are new ppl who is reconmended to play and join the fandom as well. Recently I saw a therapist called Euro Brady began playing Omori and analyze it, just shows that there's still people staying in the fandom and new people are still coming in.,1
me! i like omori!,1
I'm finally getting around to playing for the first time! Luckily I didn't get any spoilers so I'm going in almost completely blind.,1
Brother I have sunny tattooed on to me I’m locked in for real twin,1
Nah it's still very much alive, it's not like Mad Father,1
haven't finished the game but am a fan 😂,1
Yep,1
Hello 👋🏻,1
No, im still waiting on my Aubrey sequel,1
lit fuse,1
Me,1
NO nobody likes Omori anymore EVERYONE who liked it before DIED,1
Watch ‚Therapist plays Omori’.. . It is a gem.,1
Best solution. Go look at ao3. That stuff never dies.,1
like mari unfortunately</3,1
My friends are making a mod for the game so no not for me,1
yep,1
i wish i can erase my mind and play it again honestly,1
Well I don't know about almost but that entirely why would it be? It's only been 4 to 5 years theoretically could exist for at least decades.,1
I mean as somebody who just started playing Omori I can say that I’ll definently join the fandom and as long as new people like me come I don’t think it’ll die, but mabye just become less. ,1
of course,1
if our fandom dies, we'll be back in 8 years just like sally face,1
My fav game over 100, played it june 2025,1
Recently posted on X that I want Omori back on Xbox 😮‍💨 insane that’s not possible,1
not playing it or not talking about it doesn't mean im not a fan of it anymore. ill be an omori fan till the moment i drop dead,1
Currently tryna get all achievements so yes,1
Undertale ahh dialog box,1
Just played the game like a week or two ago and I loved it. Not the type of person to make memes n content but there’s still people becoming fans,1
Love omori but I’m stuck on sweetheart :(,1
I'm still playing but loving it so far,1
Dude I miss it too. I don’t think it died though, cuz just recently one of my friends revealed to me that they play omori, meaning we have fellow recruits hidden in the dark. We’re still thriving 😔 and alive,1
Ofc still my favourite game since its release,1
unrelated question but what are the Houseki no Kuni/Frieren stuff :o,1
Me,1
I will not die,1
I just joined but yes,1
I don’t wanna let this game die 😭,0
Yeah,0
Nah, that era was lowkey stupid,-1
You are so real for that,166
Alternatively, draw Something all over the cave walls along with a bunch of ominous messages to trick future geologists into thinking that there was once a terrifying creature that terrorized our society.,99
Lowkey a good idea let’s all gather and paint on rocks >:],11
Hi Mersault from hit game Limbus Company,62
Except tf2. It's not dying, it's going to live forever,19
I think it's more so "are you still active in the omori fandom", which would be No for most people,102
i mean i stopped liking friday night funkin,25
I legit feel the same way I also finished it last week for the first time couldn’t put it down. Hands down mite be one of if not the best game I have ever played. Most impactful for sure.,32
Exactly this is like saying the OFF fandom is dead,4
5 almost,31
But I just got here,1
This comment was a jumpscare in the piles of paragraphs about why or why not,5
I mean that’s when the game was released, but whoever played this in this current year (me) is like finding a gems in the ocean.,3
same,1
Ayeeeeeeee another Houseki no Kuni fan rahhhhhhhhhhh,2
Did you make this???,1
Omg hahaha the all-time peak was only 3 166 lol,1
real 🥀,1
Me too. I will never forget it. It is literally engraved into my soul and even if I die I’m brining it to heaven or hell or wherever I go,1
Wait there’s a manga,??,1
Manga,1
I’ll be one of the three 😭🙏,2
Link to manga shortcut,1
Manga,1
Manga :),1
Havent played in quite a while now and just read it as:. "Just paint literally ANYTHING just to fuck with these geologist" and i went like ????,44
Hi mike Ehrmantraut (finger),38
Still gets updated doesn't it? Might not be major but it still happens.,17
I just know u got tf2 humor,11
I didn't say that! I just said we were not filled with tumors!,3
same fnf and roblox and i moved to ultrakill,hollow knight,omori and deltarune,11
can't relate,7
fr the game is really unforgetable the idea of making you fight yourself as the final boss i never saw that in any game, and the words that omori throws at you, omori getting only stronger as he gets hurt, and then making you lose on purpose, its like they are telling you "its not about winning or losing, its about facing yourself" god this thing is peak,7
I can agree, literally near the end I almost cried. That's how powerful the storytelling is.,2
holy shit,12
,3
rahhhhhhhhh,2
It's in the game, friend,3
That just on steam. Some bought the game later on console,2
My man,2
No, no. Something. . ,43
Last update was 2018 I think,3
So real,1
same i cry very very rarely and in the end the ost of the fight with omori the words omori throws at you and then the ost of the hospital after all that chaos, i was about to cry to a game and i didnt expect that this would happen with any game,8
,3
IVE NEVER SEEN IT! SCARY!,1
I bet the peak on, say, Switch or PS would be much higher because the game had (I'd suppose) started getting known and thus hyped and awaited by the console gamers,. while on PC the stream was probably more constant for a while,1
Literally get updates every Summer, Halloween and Christmas,1
Take a look at yourself and your friends too many times and you'll see nothing but nightmares,1
Yea! I heared from the game when it released on the switch. And then after I finished the game I bought it on steam to play it again and try out some mods. . . I also thought about buying it on Xbox as I could play it on German there (it sounded so off in german in a funny way). Played on gamepass and then it was gone and couldn't buy it. Rip 5 hours in.. . I also though about buying it on Ps but my younger brother called me out. He still does jokes about throwing me down the stairs because of the game.,2
Oooo spooky. Do you know how many times you have to do it? Or is triggered by something,1
Lmao your brother is savage,1
Just a chance,1
Yea, he started it because well im his older sister, own a cat we also have a stair case that's easy to slip from and in the past i played the flute. . . Tho his personality is more of Kel and aubrey mixed. While I'm more like a mix of sunny and hero's personality.,1
Adorable dynamic (may the cat protect you),2
your sister is a saint. >!pls don't push her down the stairs btw.!<,370
Idk if I could use that lol. The art is so nice! Also happy birthday (?),149
if I recieved this I would die happy,80
oh my god this is so pretty!!! i probably wouldnt even skate it lol id rather just hang it on the wall,47
Bruh that aint your present anymore thats mine gimme,24
This is so cool!!!!! Your sister is so talented!!!!😍😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩,15
How did she do it?,16
Actually, I would like to see you use that skate board and slide on the railing of the stairs,7
Your sister is Mari tier,5
that looks really cool,4
What does it look like if you put the trucks on?,6
Looks official,2
I’d be scared to use it because skateboards get messed up pretty quickly.,3
That is actually amazing. Great gift.,3
[removed],3
Your sister has some crazy talent!,3
Don't ask for a violin just to hang out with your sister please,3
omori skatebored😳😳,2
My dude, this is extremely cute. Ask her how much for one lmao,2
Ok, that’s epic,2
That look so pretty!!,2
I reaaaaaaaally dont like having such a pretty thing on a skateboard, because with use it will scratch everywhere, so I would just hang it on a wall, because IS SO DAMN PREEEEETTTY,2
Omg that's so cool! Did she paint it?,2
Woaaah it’s very cool,2
Try to do a nose grind over the stairs and on the your left side,2
This is so amazing!!! I love skateboards, I never thought of combining OMORI and a skateboard. Super cool present,2
Kick flip down the stairs,2
Tell her to make copies she’d be rich lmao,2
That’s amazing!!,2
this is so sick omg,2
oh my goodness. its-. . . what is it?,2
Can your parents adopt me please? This is absolutely awesome,2
yooo now you can [eat shit]() like a champ,2
>!now skate on the stair railing.!<,2
WAIT IS THAT A FUCKIGNVSCKATE BOARDbbcnncn!!?!?!?!?,2

I thought this was a bookmark for a second,2
absplutley insbane,2
this is so fucking cool,2
DO A  KICKFLIP OFF A BUILDING (I'm being satire),2
YOOO SHE GOT U AN OMORI THEMES OVAL!!!!,2
Amazing!! I wouldn't be capable of using it just in case I scratch it tho,2
So cool 😍♥️😺,2
I am definitely gonna try recreating this masterpiece,1
is this a skateboard?,1
bonus points if its a skateboard,1
[deleted],1
😬,163
Thank you! Yeah, I was planning on hanging it up on my wall, away from all harm as I wouldn't do it any justice skateboarding anyways 😅,114
Hope you have a great day!,24
Hope you do well!,26
Agree,1
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm planning to do!,29
She says she used acrylics and pencils,13
I sadly don't have any to test this- I don't currently skateboard and don't have much experience but I still love it!,8
Nice!,2
I've just sent her a link so she can check this post out herself- I'm sure she'll be very happy to see how everyone here is reacting to it. Also, thank you :p,2
I think it'll depend on things such as shipping and how long it takes to finish it , which can depend on how detailed it is. If you want a more precise answer, then I think it's best to ask her directly on her [Instagram](). She's also got an Etsy page up, if that helps,1
Yep, she painted it with acrylics,1
Yepp,2
It's a skateboard deck,1
Is it too late,65
Keep it for when you really wanna style on some nerd,30
Good bot,17
[deleted],-17
Hmmm, thanks, I will try to do that to! :). Btw say to her that what she did its amazing!,7
I have a feeling Basil will suffer if you put on the trucks,8
[removed],18
You are the worst person i met on toontown,1
Doesnt he always suffer, somehow,6
And also make the board look bad. But it's fine if you just hang it on the wall.,5

Comfort bot stole my GF and totaled my car. He took my shoes so I had to run around the house looking for them, making me late for work. He even put dye in my dog shampoo, so now my dog looks like some kind of “Blue’s Clues” lookin’ MFer. . . That’s not even the icing on the cake. Oh, NOOOO! Comfort bot still has the audacity to say things like “hope you do well” or “things are going to be ok” after everything he’s done to me, just to taunt me. The gall. The absolute NERVE!. . So yeah, I guess you could say that I hate comfort bot.,11
Comfort bot killed my entire family and then said ":)" . . Fuck Comfort Bot,4
I will snap any second now,493
It's because they don't have air conditioning,356
oh no i was already mentally ill before omori  . . . it just helped make me sad,226
My psychiatrist had to request government mental health care systems to put me into several watchlists . . I'm not joking I now have to attend 5 different types of therapy on a week now . . Please end my fucking suffering I don't have enough money to buy all the meds I need ,123

I'm mentally well and have no problems whatsoever ,68
No, I don't have any issue,37

Wdym the voices tell im normal,9
I honestly found the game, though terrifying, to be somewhat comforting. My anxiety gets so bad I disassociate sometimes, among other things, so it's kind of nice to see that yeah it's fucked up but I'm not the only one.,8
Dude i was mentally ill way before omori ;-;,9
omori has worsened my mental state !,7

I just want some damn fresh Orange Joe,1
Just imagine Kel breakdancing. It helps.,1
You know, Its like that irl too,1

I held Sunny hostage at one point.,1
wait so it's not normal to find black space relatable?,1
I was depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation for the first time when I started playing Omori.  Depression followed me into the game, and lingered after I finished it.  Thankfully I had therapy (and lots of Omori fan content) to help me through the tough times.  The game resonated very strongly with me because I could see myself in Sunny through the way he acts in the game and the way he talks to himself,1
I am normal ,1
Omori is just relatable sometimes ,1
No it is not.,1
I am fine,0

yes,-1

Omori does a fantastic job of capturing the way mental illness feels.  Depression isn't sadness, anxiety isn't just fear.  It slowly changes your perception of yourself and the world around you, to the point where it almost feels like you're not quite real.  Eventually the fantastic and absurd feels as real as any other choice you can make.  Why not escape?. . Too many other forms of media seem to portray mental illness as something tangible, something easily understandable, or even simply as something logical.  How can you accurately portray something that is intrinsically going to change your own perception of itself?. . The game does a great job of accurately portraying the way mental illness feels from the perspective of the mentally ill.  Not too surprising that it resonates really well because of that.. . (fwiw, the other two things I think pull it off very well are Evangelion and Bojack Horseman).,48
Sad? To me it was cathartic,13
Same,5
It's insane how much medication fucking costs.  shelling out most of our paychecks to simply function without killing a bitch,54
Stay strong. Do not give in,6
I know this is non of my business, but do you mind telling why your psychiatrist had to do that?,1

THANK YOU,2
Slight correction, you're *autistic*. As of the DSM-5, Aspergers was taken out as a valid diagnosis and is now just considered Autism. And even if you are not from North America, you might want to refrain from using it since it has ties to >!Hans Asperger, the originator of the diagnosi, "Asperger's", who colluded with Nazis during the 2nd World War. He would call them "autistic psychopaths", and consider it a "puzzling and tragic condition". Which it's not. He had a major part to play in the deaths of autistic people during that time period.!<. . I just want to make sure that you're up to speed since many people, even some neurodivergent people, aren't aware of it's true origins.. . I also want to mention that functioning labels are rather harmful as well, and it would be good to alter that. The current terms from what I remember are "Support Needs". So if someone is High Support Needs, then they'll need lots of accommodations, but if Low Support Needs, maybe not as many. [Here's an article]() on that you can read at your leisure.. . I hope I haven't overloaded you on information, but it's good to learn.,-1
I am too afraid to do the Hikikomori route because I can’t bear the thought of Kel not getting sunny out of the house,5
I decided to do some research on >!hellmari!< at night. Worst decision of my life, for the longest of times I thought something was watching me from my door ,3

Not same,6
As someone who discovered Omori during the month or so I got diagnosed with depression and got my meds, watching this game really made me go "oh shit, yeah I feel that" instead of the typical "what if I'm making things up" schtick. So yeah other than the oyasumi part I find Sunny to be very relatable,21
You put my thoughts into words! I've struggled with mental illness for a long time now, and I recently played this game for the first time and I think what it did is so incredible and just a really good representation, I'm amazed by how well they pulled it off! I love Omori so much for what it is (´ω`),2
you put my thoughts perfectly into words,2
This, tho.. . I'm depressed and anxious af, but this game was a nice outlet.,11
Yeah...I haven't been able to even take my meds because it's either chosing between meds or rent,food, electricity bill,water bill,bills,internet AND taxes.... . At least they give me a single free sandwich everytime I go to therapy so maybe that's supposed to balance things out /s,22
All 5 of them already know that,but it's not like they can increase my paycheck...,1
,5
I'm mentally well and also dont have problems,16
Well not anything major atleast but honestly that's probably a good thing I would be so bored if their weren't atleast a few struggles to deal with.,2
Mmmm, I'm with gogocrazy on this one. I generally felt nothing nor was anything in particular awakened to me once I finished Omori. Doesn't mean I don't love it as I derive  my excitement from other aspects of the game. I only came to appreciate it after stewing a bit on it.. . Not to mention I have both thought about and seen horror stuff much scarier than Omori. Omori is less scary to me and more unsettling. It can really make you feel like something is off and only very rarely resorts to jumpscares and loud noices. Gigachad developer move,16
Probably because they have also seen things fifty times worse before they played this game and have stopped caring.,3

Man I just thought my mental issues was named after a funni vegetable xd Anyhows I don't really see how referring to something as high and low functioning is harmful per say but that's okay. Guess I'm a Low Support Needs accoustic guy now?,-1

I felt that, we have to stay strong!  Shit sucks, and it just gets shittier but hopefully things will get easier. Mental illness is becoming more seen since the pandemic and hopefully that means prices will drop eventually. Im sure you're an incredibly strong person considering you still are trying. I know I'm just a rando on reddit, but I believe in yout5\31hpy:2463,10
It's very unfortunate that you have to go through this. If only medication and therapy wasn't so expensive. (Though what I meant was why *did* your psychiatrist have to call for you to be on several watchlists. I was curious on what happened for you to qualify to be on a watchlist, let alone 5.). . There's nothing much I can do, but I can pray for things to get better for you. I wish you all the best in life. And for many more good things to come as well.,1
That's really concerning coming from sweetheart..,17
The fact that these came from ppl with Maverick and Sweetheart tag is suspicious,8

My two fanbases are combining. I don't know how to feel about this.,255
I bet basil planted herbs for Mari,140
So >!SOMETHING wasn't created by Sunny pushing Mari down the stairs, but it was created once she died from her addiction!<,183
“Hey Omori! Check out this new item I found in the Junkyard!”,50
I can't take it anymore,42
Reminds me of a story about one of my parent's college friends, who got their name "Mary Warner" mispronounced as Marijuana by a sub teacher with a thick southern accent.,31
GOD.  . . . DAMN IT.,21
I made a fic about Mari getting high on AO3 awhile ago and this is awesome,17
I hate this, because everytime I see one of these blunt memes, I know that the pose comes from a fucking Mario render,12
All I saw was "MARIjuana" in my notifications. This is about what I expected.,21
blursed,8
someone draw rasai and mari smoking togeter,10
Marijuana is legal in my country and id like you to know that.,7
ayo mari with the fat blunt 😳,6
im scared for my life,5
[Thank you for helping create this interaction with a friend](),6
Cursed,5
I'd gladly smoke a fat one with her ngl,4
WHY,4
Ah hell no,3
Mari's smoking a fat blunt,4
Mari is >!Smoking a fat blunt! Just why!<,4
perfect,4
>! Omori au where Mari dies of a drug overdose and Sunny and Basil frame it as a suicide !<,4
I LOL’D!!!!!,3
MARI STOP-,5
>!😡 ✋🪜!<,3
No.,3
i csnt,3
hey u/Moldea,3
she looks like if she was a character from the backyardigans,3
First Name Mari. Last Name Juana,3
HEROin???,3
Same with a meme I made long time ago on imgFlip.. . Also, Mari smoking a fat dart.,3
Mari goes down the stairs and dies.,3
OH GOD NO,3
oh no mari don't you'll get sick!!,3
Why- it was Ralsei, then Mari,3
goin hiiigh lil brotha,3
I swear this fandom will be the death of me.,3
Omori, but Mari suffers from addiction and dies from it,  I don't know but that sounds more depressing than the original plot.,6
Mari is high as f\*ck XD,2
Well this sub has gone downhill,1
doobie,1
it's the proud stance for me,1
hopefully she doesn't have to worry about lung cancer,1
,1
Omori get the watermellon,44
It's not dream stans so it should be fine lmao,55
feel proud pal, this...thing...is funny as hell XD,4
I wouldn't be surprised if Basil being a florist gave Mari some weed to calm her down in practice, hell that might even have prevented "the pizza incident" XD,59
That's actually a sick fanfic idea,85
So basically its just a videogame adaptation of requiem for a dream?,10
RIP Mari, she died from injecting one to many marijuanas.,7
I think it’d be from how hard it is to smoke properly. If you don’t do it properly, your lungs are gonna hurt.,5
"OH NO Mari! You'll get Lung Cancer and die!",11

I deadass just realized why it looks so familiar bruh,6
the weed duo XD,4

that won't work for them, that's how I see it.,1
Then sunny made omori so he becomes Omori Juana.,3
Tell me what would be the drugs that would rhyme with the names of the Omori characters,2
Water,19
my ears burn,5
"Perfectly Imperfect" it would be a good title, Mari uses drugs to improve her performance in music but at the cost of becoming addicted and seriously affecting his relationship with Hero and distancing herself from Sunny and his friends.. .    . and the worst thing is that this may be based on real facts of musicians who suffered from addictions.. . you...go to Ao3 and give them this bloody idea!.,67
smoke weed everyday.,2
Nice,5
It would be kind of funny for person to read this au, and be sad, then realize it was inspired but Mari smoking a fat blunt,36

Thought the same, it's literally the Green/Red shell attack from almost all games.. . Sad that Alphadream went bankrupt.,2
yeah but that's stat-wise, "pass to hero" is by far the best follow-up in the game,8

I'm sorry but seeing Aubrey do that suplex as soon as Kel walked in was just so perfect.,6
the face sun's doing at the end... *yes*,4
true,3
aubrey would suplex him,3
uhm...tbh i dunno if Aubrey suplex Sunny to prevent Kel from finding them like that, or if it really was part of a prank ,3

But they're already clashing Kel,2
Aubrey suplexes sunny, because she can.,2

I don't know if professional wrestling is that much of a secret...or a dance...,4
Its a glass eye,1
He’s got that unspoken rizz though. ,4
He's Mari's brother, he's just too shy to use rizz ,6
That's the problem.. . What If Sunny was enjoying it?,155
I'm pretty sure the reason Sunny was getting suplexed in the first place is because Kel barged in, and Aubrey's 'make it look like anything but what was about to happen' instincts took over,21

There's no wrestling involved, its something that your young mind must not know.,1

Noted then, have a good day, afternoon or wherever your timezone is at,2
Nah it's definitely wrestling,3
Maybe,10
Hollow Knight pfp? Definitely needs emotional support (I love the game),6
Hk players when there's no Silksong,8

omori doesn't want sunny to go to school,631
According to the artist's [twitter](), Sunny has to go to High School. Omori has to go to Middle School. Omori wants to go with Sunny. Mari is trying to stop Omori and send him to his school.  . . . (3 Sibling AU),262
At first I thought that Sunny was trying to pull the stop sign out of the ground and Omori and Mari were trying to stop him,38

Mari: OLD BAG WITCH?! OH NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT YOU MONOCHROME BRAT!,168
Too bad it can't stop the conflict,6

While not this setting, I did see one where it's after the game, >!Mari's still dead,!< but a previously thought dead eldest brother finds his way back home, Mori. Didn't read it all but I do remember it existing, thing it's >!The Eldest Sibling.!<. . There's probably some others where Omori is actually a sibling or where Omori spills into the real world and becomes a sibling lol,43
as undertale fan i hate AU's idk why,7

as an Undertale fan, I don't really care one way or the other.,2
she said kel is a gross color, so i guess she's racist,3096
Walter white reference??????!!!!!,1373
An indicator is perhaps Aubrey's mother, who has light brown hair,605
imma guess white tbh,576
She’s Aubrey.,404
The answer is very clear. . . Mii fighter,324
okay my head Cannon is Aubrey is half white and half asian,142
99% sure kel and hero are, or at least partly, mexican. they have an ofrenda in their house,321
She is R'lyehian,96
Sunny and mari are asian?,101
As I see it:   .    . Hero and Kel are Mexican.   .    . Mari and Sunny are half Japanese.   .    . Basil would be British.   .    . And Aubrey would be the only one of American nationality.  . . . ... is just a way to see this so please dont kill me xd,185
imo i think she's wasian,28
She is tarnished,50
99% sure kel and hero are, or at least partly, mexican. they have an ofrenda in their house,19
I’m gonna say she’s white just so there can be two of each,36
KEL AND HERO ARE LATINO!? Gnom a cry finally some rep of my favorite characters ,16
White probably because she is Christian and the only part of East Asia that is plurality Christian is South Korea and while that would be very interesting her heritage isn’t mentioned so it’s anyones guess. I would put a higher weight on White though because the game is set in a small town,30
probably also asian (in the end duet scene when she and basil were holding hands her skin tone is noticeably different),49
I ALWAYS HEADCANNONED KEL AND HERO BEING HISPANIC AND MARI AND SUNNY BEING ASIAN I LOVE THIS EEE,14
To me auby is auby.,25
Clearly Aubrey is Argentinian or Chilean,24
It's obvious. She's a bitch,11
She's a bitch,11
White, but has actually been able to get some form of light tan, unlike Basil who seems like he would be ether pale as fuck or sunburned to hell,21
Aubrey is a creature beyond mortal comprehension, she is a woman.,8
wasian,8
I mean, she could be mixed race. Hapa!,6
I just imagined her as half white half Asian in my head for some reason …? Maybe cause it’s similar to my group of friends,7
As a wasian person, she's wasian. Canon because I said so 💪,13
Sunny and Mari: Albanian. . Basil: Albanian. . Hero and Kel: Albanian. . Aubrey: Serbian,26
She looks white to me tbh,13
Polynesian,6
Unpopular opinion, but I think kel and hero are a Latino/Asian mix because hero has a slightly lighter skin tone and darker hair ,6
I had no idea kellogs and herobrine were latinos!. Truly the representation I never knew I needed,6
Why did you come to the conclusion that Hero and Kel are Latino/hispanic? Like was there something in the game that suggests it or are you just going off skin color? If anything I thought Kel was so tanned because he probably spends a lot of time outside playing sports.,29
Homo sapien.,9
Aubrey is a sixth dimensional five-headed centaur shapeshifter that has been sent from અરે પિઝા અહીં છે to research about humans so her nation can greatly take over the earth and destroy humanity. End of story,10
CaucASIAN,5
Aubrey is a demon from the far lands,4
She is Br*tish,6
What I go off of. . . Kel and Hero : Mexican (68% Spanish 1% Lebanese 29 31% amerindian). . Basil : Quebecer (100% French). . Aubrey: Half Irish Half argentine(40% Italian 40% Spanish 20% Welsh). . Mari and Sunny Half Japanese Half anglo American(100% wasp probably mayflower origins),23
How do you know that Hero and Kel are Hispanic?,7
I think she’s half white and half Asian,3
Kel gives me filipino vibes honestly,3
gay or european? it's hard to guarantee,7
Human,8
She could be mixed ig,3
maybe mixed,3
maybe she's mixed?,3
I think she's autistic,7
Definitely white,5
white?,2
idk🤔 I suppose she's just British or something like that, lol,2
White snow,2
she is neither. she is god,2
I always assumed wasian ig,2
I remember seeing a post that made Basil Hitler,. . . Guess Basil is an aryan,2
I thought I saw something about her being Puerto Rican but idk where I saw it from.,2
Basil is definitely a little German boy,2
Personally I think she’s white because seeing her family kinda points at it also. ,2
Aubrey is normal,2
why not be both??,2
I think she’s wasian, specifically of Korean and Anglo-American descent . . The Korean thing is because a lot of Korean ppl are Christian but that’s just my headcanon and I’m not claiming to be right or anything lol,2
Maybe American French cause Albury sounds French but idk,2
She's Auberginian,2
Maybe wasian???,2
Maybe she's mixed?,2
This is so funny cause I never even considered what race anyone was, I just played the game lol,2
Vegetable,2
What are you stupid, she’s clearly “???” It literally says it right there,2
I feel like Basil is a Greek Orthodox Christian while Aubrey is a Italian Catholic Christian,2
Just as white as Numbah 1 from Kids Next Door?,2
polish,3
She's god,3
Some wiki's say that aubreys full name is "aubergine" I am not sure if aubrey is an abbrevation or something like that I never had any friends with that name. . . . Update: I searched a little And some sites Said that the name "aubergine" is french, and is also gender neutral,2
black aubrey,4
Bri"ish,4
I think she's white, don't kill me.,4
I thought this was a meme about anime/Manga artist white washing all their characters. Lmfao,2
lebanese maybe? some arabic people can look really white,1
Sei lá, pergunta pra Omocat,1
Bosnian. Trust me.,1
Jew?,2
😐,1
y'all saying auby is racist but i dont think its canon that kel and hero are hispanic (or is it?), like they could just have tanned skin,1
What’s more confusing for me is aubrey gets blue eyes in real world when we can clearly see they’re black in the past,1
God,1
in all seriousness, in the real world her eyes seem pretty white when it comes to shape and color. only 1% of asian ppl r blue eyed which makes it pretty unlikely that she would be asian.,1
Not that it matters but… since this is set in a small suburban town in the United States, isn’t it likely that they’re all white?,1
anyone else think its weird and lame that there is absolutely no black ppl in this game lol,-3
I mean I somewhat agree on these headcanons but you could also just be completely wrong.,0
Grown up Aubrey has blue eyes. While it could be contacts considering she also has dyed hair, I’m gonna go with Caucasian,-4
ooooof you are wrooooong,-2
I think they are all humans and that matters more than their lineage.. .  Fretting over your lineage is what leads you and your family to be killed of by 4 kids and have multi generational trauma weaken your descendants, so that they also succumb to said kids with the last remaining one drowning in alcohol and depression. That is really this bad to obsess over heritage like that.,-4
nah kel and hero’s family are definitely italian imo,-6
I think she black,-5
They support lgbt,-4
Ey another fellow with poor racial detection sensors,-3
Hispanic are latinos,-6
WHITE->,1
Aubrey's ethnicity is Girl,1
Irish,1
Clearly she's a Corpus,1
Clearly she is from Waterdeep,1
Aubrey is Aubrey,1
Anteny is British with extremely heavy accent,1
Personally I headcanon aubrey as Quebecois,1
White? You mean American?,1
Japanese?,1
I hc that sunny and Mari are Japanese and Aubrey is half Korean,1
I am an unknown breed LMAO,1
I think Basil and Aubrey are europeans,1
Most definitely white,1
She looks European to me for so,e reason??,1
also white i guess?,1
she's precious,1
i think shes mixed, white mom and asain dad maybe?,1
Wait, can someone explain why Mari and Snunny are asian pls! Im curious now,1
Spanish,1
ascending above the concept of race,1
Auby is . . *BRI'ISH*,1
I I’m pretty sure she’s white but I doesn’t really matter what race anyone is,1
Just overthought it and yeah probably.. . 2 Latino (kel and hero). . 2 asian (the Suzuki kids). . and 2 white (basil and Aubrey.),1
Idk if Kel and Hero are latinos. I just thought Kel had that west coast kind of tan that can make you mistake a white guy for a black guy,1
gross color,1
mixed maybe?,1
Auby is probably white,1
Spanish,1
Aubrey’s extra white,1
She is a Polish icon /j,1
She's white,1
I'm pretty sure she's white. I've seen some interpret her as Hispanic, but the only connection  I can see Is her crippling poverty.,1
Possibly a mix of asian-white or just full white honestly, we only ever see her mother sitting on the couch backwards and have no real idea of what the father is. Safe to assume the mother is white because of the sprite, but it would depend on Auberys father if she's a mix or full-white, and since we never see his sprite or any npc of him, it's a mystery.,1
Aubrey is eu full.. Kel is from... dunno maybe he is eu? Or some Latam country but there's withe ppl on them too and i don't have enough facial things to point so... dunno.. Basil is the most white boy ever.. Same with sunny and mari,1
Well in Memory Lane, Aubrey has Dark Brown hair, her mother has light brown hair and we don’t know about her dad but it’s safe to assume his hair is black. . So it’s a possibility that she could be mixed of White and Asian or just White,1
French,1
Mother looks white. Possible asian father, but we’ll never know. Gonna go with White, possibly half asian as the final answer.,1
I thought they were all white except Hero and Kel-,1
Is sunny really asian?. . I don't think so,1
Idk why this reminded me of Camp Buddy..,1
She's clearly African American,1
Nah aubrey white man,1
This is a really strange question...,1
Albanian 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🦅,1
Wait, isn't Hispanic the same as white?,1
Auby is turkish cCc (joke),1
At least it not another post about green flower boy,1
Maybe she's black?,1
Latino hispanic?,1
She is an Eggplant,1
White but that isn't what matters. They're true americans, sons and daughters of our beloved nation. ,1
Dude, they all look the same.,1
Kel and hero are chads.,1
Persia or middle eastern?,1
shes auby!,1
Shes Jewish,1
white 💀,1
Auby = purple (aubregine or thanos, you decide lol),1
What if she's wasian? Or a dark haired white? Or middle eastern...?,1
basil is walter white?!,1
Auby is Southern European. . Bagel is Balkan (my headcanon). . the rest is obvious,1
Honestly they all look white to me except maybe kel,1
Shes pink,1
Auby is an AUBERGINE,1
I thought  Aubrey was Korean????,1
aubrey = aubergine —> french. aubrey = french. . (it’s why aubrey carries around an eggplant plushie),1
She is an eggplant,1
Korean, maybe? Idk, I seem to like the idea of the friend group being VERY diverse, because I also like to believe that Basil is swedish or german.,1
I say white bc Brown hair.,1
Tbh to me she's at least half asian, since the way she's drawn as a kid is really similar to the way Sunny and Mari(who are heavily coded as Japanese) are drawn, and in some of the official art she isn't nearly as pale as Basil. Her being half white makes sense to me, since her mom doesn't look that much like her.,1
My hc has always been that hero and kel are Asian Hispanic, Aubrey is Asian, maybe part white, and for me it’s really vivid that omori and Mari and Asian,1
Italian,1
She’s cute, that’s what she is,1
Asian I mean ig because of her eyes,1
… she said Kel was a “gross color” because Kel said her favorite color was gross. she’s not racist she’s a child. if he had said “pink is dumb” she would’ve said “you’re dumb”,1
Light skin color, preferably lighter than Asians, I am one my self, now, she looks like a Hispanic, or white, but judging by her future appearance (after the, thing, that happened, idk how to put spoiler tags) she has blue eyes, which might be a sign that she is white, because there aren’t Asians that got blue eyes, but there are white and Hispanic people like that, so aubrey is one of those two.,1
She's British, she just hides her accent.,1
*AUBY NO*,1048
Seriously though, where did the racist aubrey thing start,45
definitely asain,6
White it is,2
she WHAT!?,2
that was headspace/angsty aubrey atleast i guess i dunoo never played the game eyy,2
She was a kid and could have just wanted a comeback,1

Until you realise that white people have all the hair colours commonly!,10

That didn’t strike me as weird because there are shrines and photos with candles everywhere.,28
They could also be Filipino. A lot of Filipino culture also comes from spanish heritage. Basketball is also quite popular in the philippines.,16
Yes! I noticed so when I was playing the other day.,3
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Auby R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn,40
oh r'lye?,3
I think like half Asian, at least that’s my guess based on their family portrait,153
Mari in Japanese means Truth, their dad had a Bonsai tree, Omocat is half Asian, Oyasumi is Japanese for Goodnight, Hellmari is similar to an onryō, Mari and their mother took flower arrangement classes, and also, the type of flower language used in the game is specifically Hanakotoba, which is the Japanese language of flowers. Oh, and also, Sunny's flower, the white tulip, in the Japanese language of flowers means Forgiveness.. . Also, the white egret flowers are apparently native to areas around Japan.. . . . This link is where I found the meaning of the white egret without reference to the game (very hard with how popular Omori is). It also mentions Hanakotoba.. . . . This is the link I think Omocat used. Apparently my phone had to translate it from Japanese, so I think this is the best thing I got.,91
I mean their dad is Filthy Frank,52
The name Sunny is a predominantly Asian boy name, their skin is slightly yellow compared to everyone else's and the many japanese phrases and references such as Omori from the word hikikiomori but yeah mostly headcannon,59
I mean, Omori is part of the word “Hikikomori” which is a Japanese term for someone who avoids social interactions and personal hygiene. Plus, in the game, there’s a route called “Hikikomori”,21
Its a common headcannon, though I have no clue why as they don't look very asian to me.,8
In my headcannon they would be brittish,8
You can tell cuz one plays violin and the other plays piano,2
Oh, so that's why >!Basil stabs people on the eye!!<,185
Does the game ever give a set location? I don't remember. But I feel like Aubrey is one of those where setting would def affect what I view her as. . . Like most people in Japan agree Sailor Moon is Asian, as it is set in Japan and created by Japanese artists, but many white americans assume she is white b/c blue eyed blonde despite the setting and origin. Aubrey kind of feels like one of those where the player's bg has more of an effect on how we see her ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|thinkingfacehmm). . Alternately if you're gonna break it down just by looks, her features are closest to Mari so my guess would be at least part asian,25
Basil is British, do you know how little that narrows him down. He could be English, Scottish, whelsh, unionist or Manx,4
Basil's Irish take it or leave it,2
YES! BRITISH BASIL IS THE BEST HEADCANON!!! /srs,2

How is kel mexican? I can see the dream world kel but really??,3

Opening their fridge also says Sunny can't recognize what's in there, which doesn't apply to any of the other houses,7

balanced,6
nah religion doesn't really change much as much of my family who moved from Singapore to Australia are all very christian. and its quite common for Asian people to become christian when they migrate to a more western country.,48
My mom's side of the family is christian, and they are from Vietnam.,5
i can see her being korean but the small town part and "not many asians are christian" don't matter,2
Nah, Basil’s pasty as hell, #FFFFFF-looking motherfucker,147
i think basils just really fucking white and aubrey is just a little more tanned,70
as an argentinian myself I confirm we are racist XD. ,17
That explains her calling kel a weird colour, let’s just leave it at her grandfather being a German immigrant…,15

That and they have ofrenda at home which is an offering for the Mexican holiday "Dia de los muertos",73
yeah but she has to have a human cover if she's playing a character right?,1
aww yeah, some Argentina representation 🧉,11
Welsh? :D. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿,5
Imagining Basil speaking with a Quebec accent is the last thing that would've come in my mind, and yet it isn't that bad,4
Basil from Canadia,1
They have ofrenda which is an offering for the Mexican holiday Dia de los muertos (Day of the dead) also small hints like having a lot of family relatives pictures,58
ofrenda,5
mr plantegg,1
what,16
She goes to church,24
what? ,3
Its a joke because Kel said pink hair is gross and she said something like hes a gross color lol nothing actually personal or direct just a "no u" theres also ofrenda in their house which is a Mexican tradition for the holiday Dia de los muertos, they dont outright say it though because its not important its just fun hints and implications,12
They're contacts, you can see she has black eyes in her photo with Kim,10
She wears contact lenses I think,8
her eyes are dark brown/black (you can see this in old photos of her, esp the rain one), she just wears contacts,3
I coulda sworn there were black NPCs in the real world portions of the game...,5
we have one, and they are a massive bitch ,3
yeah there's some dark-skinned npcs in faraway but none of them look black. There seems to be a complete lack of any form of curly hair as well, and everyone in headspace looks white since (aside from omori being literal pure black+white) everyone has the same skin tone, even kel and hero.... . actually now that I think about it there is angel, I think he's the only character with curly hair, but he's not black..,0
why is this getting downvoted this subreddit is weird,1
Its in the game, at least the part of Kel and Hero being Mexican everything else ig you could claim its headcanon, but like Basil its pretty evident hes white.,9
It is contacts, it was said in game, wasn't it?,25
I think they're probably contacts. You can see she doesn't have blue eyes in other scenes like the [duet flashbacks]() or her [picture with Kim](),7
They are contacts...?  [proof](),5
about which part?,2
They're Mexican lol,14
Being from Spain makes you Hispanic but it doesnt make you Latino because Spain is in Europe not Latin America,14
NAH RLLY THATS CRAZYYY,4
Hispanic folks *can be* latino, but they aren't all latino. Same vice versa, since Brazil is majority Portuguese-speaking but still latino. "Hispanic" means Spanish-speaking, while "latino" means from latin america.,1
Also, I think Hero Is actually "Enrique" and Kel Is the short for "Kelvin", they both share the surname "Cervantes". . And I can imagine Sunny's surname así "Migasaki",1
at least she's not homophob-  okay nvm,692
Auby yes,10

Are you sure about that?,259
Asia is actually known for their bad treatment of darker skinned people lol, theres a reason why theyre obsessed with looking as white and bright as possible,161
My best friend's family who are predominantly from Cambodia and risked their lives, as well as lost loved ones, trying to escape to the U.S. during the Cambodian genocide are very anti-black and weirder, anti-refugee. Like friends? You?? Were literally??? Refugees??????? Like her mom literally almost died on the boat over due to starvation and her uncle is a 'build the wall' 'refugees from mexico are coming to make the US more democrat' type. . . Just bc something is logical, doesn't mean people do it. Not to mention how exclusive different Asian communities can get. Same friend tried to join the Korean student association in Uni bc she's half and talked about how insular it was and how if you didn't actively speak korean you were kind of subtly pushed out regardless of your background,18

she didn't mean it literally in that dialogue lmao,2
some of the east Asians i know are whiter than the whitest guys i know,1

yo thats a crazy take bro lmao,1
Id also guess white, since people say Omori is implied to take place in America, where Caucasian people are the ethnic majority. I still agree that Sunny and Mari definitely have some kind of Asian descent though.. . (Also, every race can be racist.),1
she's just that powerful,45

Forbidden black space sequence: Sunny's dad with the pocket ravioli,8
this is the best thing I’ve read on this subreddit,7
there is a good chance that the many Japanese references are just a result of all of OMOCAT's work in general having lots Japanese items, references and e.t.c. . i'm probably wrong but i thought i might add that. Sunny is still probably Japanese,32
I didn't realize. That makes sense as to why his dream version is called Omori.,3

Mari’s headspace seifuku would be my guess for one reason,16
How don't they look Asian when the art style is so simplified that it doesn't portray any racial features at all? Or are you one of those weirdos who think no racial features means white because white is the "normal race" and non white people should be drawn with caricatures to be anything else than white?. . Also straight (usually black) hair is an Asian feature which Sunny and especially Mari have,6

: >! oi, oi, oi... there really innit a way out of this... eh, bruv? !<. . : What are you even saying?!,253
Hey, spoiler,11
I think OMORI is definitely set in the US, due to the fact that real world currency is given in dollars with a George Washington symbol. I assume the time it takes place is late 90s early 00s. I assume that Aubrey would be American from this,45
It's set in the (probably) eastern us.,2
Hmmm you know i think you have a good point,3
know if that's the case the important question is he a catholic or protosident and how many times has his family either been or nearly falsely/geuinly imprsioned/almost blown or blown up. Remember this is in the 90s ireland was just off the good friday agreement,2
are refering to english basil or scotish basil or whelsh basil or manx basil or norhtenr irish basil,1
British is like 5 different things (english, whelsh, scotish, people who say fuck democracy and sign a contract in blood and the manx),2
I mean her stuffed toy is an eggplant,,,1
I mean her stuffed toy is an eggplant,, although she calls it Mr. Plantegg not Mr. Gineauber lol,1
Kel and Hero’s house has an ofrenda, which is more common in Mexican cultures.,30
Rice tarnished.,1
vouch. source: am from singapore and born in aus,8
yeah my family came from hong kong and they've been christians for as long as they can remember,5
yeah true, This can even just be proved with statistics, around 1/3 of the global population (2/3 in America specifically as well) are Christian, and 5.7% of Americans are Asian, so there's bound to be overlap being the most common religion both globally and in America.. . According to google, 42% of Asian Americans are Christian.,1
Ah, I was just working off my prior knowledge and I looked it up and Christians are a plurality (though not a majority) so she apparently could be Christian. It’s just that a Christian is much more likely to be white and Asians are quite more likely to live in urban or suburban areas,3
oh yeah definitely lol, in the end duet scene you can see him holding hands with Aubrey and he looks like a fucking ghost,2
homestuck reference?,6
must be english,1
yeah cause aubrey touches grass,65
Basil the british,1
LMAO,9
Same 💪,3
>ofrenda. . I completely missed it, time for another play through,57
oh snap i missed that,10
Damn... I'm Mexican and I totally missed this,16
I completely missed in my playthroughs then. I thought that Kel and Hero being hispanic/latino was just another headcanon that the Omori community decided it was true, like Sunny and Mari's second name being "Suzuki",26
Yes. And she simply just made an ai that was fed with really really pretty models so it can set the beauty standart. Then she made the ai make "the prettiest human in the world", and it made Aubrey. Notice how she looks compeletely mixed of every race? Yea, it's because of that. So to answer your question, the human the sixth dimensional slug is playing is just an ai-made creation,1
Came from a dream I had,4
Yea I'm going off of baseline of demographics that I've mentioned and theirs lots of Welshman in Argentina so....,5
I just mean he's of quebec decent I image his voice sounding like armin from attack on titan. Young basil though to me sounds like Barbatos atleast that's what my head cannon is.,1
Quebec is Canadian,1
In the game it was said that she isn’t part of the congregation. She started coming to church somewhere after Mari’s death and seem to treat it as a place of safety, since she dosen’t have that at her house. . . I do believe other characters from the church mentioned something about her mother and seemed to side with her having problem with Aubrey and not the other way around. So it’s possible Aubrey and her mother may have attended the church when she was younger. So either her mother is an atheist or dosen’t bother to be involved with her religion sufficiently. . . I wonder what Aubrey actually came to believe in, but I don’t think she believes in Christianity either. I think she has faith/hope in afterlife and seeks some kind of closure with Mari. Alternatively despite timing, her attendance is completely disconnected from Mari incident and is just caused by her issues at her house. Then she treats the church as someone who dosen’t like to read, treats library.,8
Someone can be Jewish ethnically or secularly based on heritage but still not practise judaism. In jewish religious law someone who is Jewish is Jewish for life, you can’t opt out via participating in another religion if your mother is Jewish or u converted  which I think is cool,6
Maybe she converted?,3
you can also be ethnically jewish and practice other religions,1
I dunno,1
Ohhh I didn’t know that!,2
wait rlly? i never knew, ig that further proves she might be asian.,1
Wait is sweetheart black canonically,1
Pretty sure Kel and Hero aren't ever stated to be Mexican in game. As for Basil sure but again don't really know his heritage.,-4
I believe you I just don’t remember. Been a while since I played,2
a lot of it,-3
it never confirms or denies that i just said my hc ,-4
[deleted],-8
That’s fake, not latin América are the latinos from america, but the portugueses ans Spanish are latinos,1
i mean its the early 2000s theres probably a good chance she is,355
wait a minute. . she loves to go to church and she is probably Christian, i think you know where i'm going with this,251
She can't be homophobic,she has a girlfriend!. . ^(it's in times like this that I feel sad for not having a Kim emoji to use.),146
 You can say that she's in the *Aub-right*,35
??,27
Even better😏,1
Confused,1
Source,17
I imagine Hero was like Hank in the garage scene when  Walt confronted him,143
Not really, I’ve never played persona ,10
we have come for your heroin,42
That one person 500 miles away:,6
People also assume that Sunny and Mari are technically mixed as well. They say that due to Omocat being Asian American, as well as their father looking particularly of Asian decent, apart from their mother who appears white, they're half Asian.,2
Homes never been to Southeast Asia,236
My guy Latino and Hispanic isn’t any darker than Southern Chinese/Vietnamese,-37
E P I C,1
Da boss can sock me,16
\>:( Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting,14
Personally I think Dad is Asian and Mom is white American, at least that’s what I gathered from the family picture. What do you think? . . Also thanks! Byzantines have a famous Basil, omori has a famous Basil >!both had a thing for eye stabbing!<. Coincidence? I think not!,57
ravioli ravioli...,7
Sunny's dad left because his wife cheated on him with a black drone,4
Why not both? ,10
Yusuke Kitagawa be like,11
This some funny shit mate.,1
This has ruined me thanks,44
As a British person I am sobbing and crying this is comedy gold,29
The funniest thing about this is the way you used ‘innit’,10
You can go in even further: the place they usually call sandwiches heroes is in New York. Faraway Town is most likely a made up place in Long Island, since they mention "the city" repeatedly and talk about how it's relatively nearby. . . poor sunny is moving to the city that is an assault on your senses,21
Just kidding in here but like I remember in a bo en stream (not canon but funny nonetheless) where he just said that it all takes place in the UK (probably a joke). IIRC it was the Stop AAPI Hate stream,1
What about Canada or Australia? They both use dollars and have beach’s,1
I take it back, dw kel looks indian,1
Double vouch. Source: am from Aus and born in Singapore,3
tbf out of all the characters, basil prob touches grass the most.,34
Thanks for the award!,1
The Suzuki thing was interesting because I associate that with Suzuki Violin which in most games I'd dismiss but not Omori,,, If it's not supposed to be related it's at least ironic and there's a high likelihood with Sunny being kind of a beginner at violin that he used the Suzuki books,2
Patagonia, right? We learn about it a lot over here in wales, mainly because it’s the only real major Welsh community outside of wales itself lol,4
yes, Basil from Canadia, like I said,1
Bad bot,4
No I don't think so, the popstar she's based off didn't have dark skin in Faraway if I remember correctly,1
They don't outright say it because its not really important but its heavily implied by the things you find at their house, you dont have to know basils exact heritage to know he's white lol,7
Oh, ok,3
which ones,1
Hispanic just means they're from Spanish speaking origins, so if you dont know where someone is from only that theyre from Spanish speaking background you say they're Hispanic.,11
[Breaking News: The Britannica is Fake According to a Redditor](),1
Oh. Okay I see what you're saying. Yes, people from Spain and Portugal are not latino. However, Spanish folks are typically considered Hispanic, since Hispanic means Spanish-speaking. That's why there are Hispanic latinos but there are also latinos who aren't Hispanic. Brazilians are latinos who aren't Hispanic, because the official language is Portuguese, even though they might not be Portuguese by heritage. Mexicans are latinos who *are* Hispanic, because the official language is Spanish, even though they might not be Spanish by heritage.,1
Wait til she find out he’s also aiming for her emo boy,208
Actually probably not, like there is official wlw art of Aubrey, though it was from before omori came out,16
>! wait, doesn't she only go outta guilt? not because she actually believes? !<,171
She's part of one of those congregations that accept everyone ,116
Ah, so if she was asian, she'd probably be filipino,38
not all christians are homophobic, in fact its mostly catholics that are homophobic,36
Hey what are you talking about.,5
: yes I’m gay yes I’m homophobic we exist,185
oh yes! that's right! sorry auby! (still racist),6
More like a bitchfriend,4
I want to slap you so hard right now, but that was a really good pun.,10
The joke is that Basil is widely considered to be gay,51
the joke is that basil is considered to be gay,1
The game. Kel said pink was a gross color, then she did the "No u" insult basically. It was the memory in the rainy day photos.,144
In the memory lane/violin mending sequence, in the rainy memory Aubrey talks about wanting to dye her hair with Mari and dye it pink. Kel says pink is a gross color. She tells Kel that he's a gross color.,79
Hero: “I don’t… I don’t even know who I’m talking to…”. Sunny: “If that’s true… if you don’t know who I am… then your best course.. would be to **tread lightly.**”,72
GET THE FUCK OUTTA MILWAUKEE,37
Or the Indian Subcontinent, or the Asian portion of the Middle East,72
I’m literally native vietnamese, fuck off,-3
that doesn't change the fact that colorism is a very real thing in Asia,52
I'll just leave it at "theres plenty of videos on the topic",17
[deleted],11
wait what is the point that you are trying to make here...?,5
My friend has a theory that their mom isnt actually their biological mom, and shes a step-mom instead, but because their real mom left so early on in sunny's lifespan, he only knows her as his actual mom. . Which explains why she looks so different from everyone else,32
What's in the pocket-oli,3
Adachi,5
funny lobster man,2
at least it's not jersey.,3
From the art calendar how they celebrate Thanksgiving in November definitely not Canada and winter in December definitely not Australia,4
But not necessarily outdoors anymore.,15
No problem I lol'd remembering when everyone was memeing Argentina,2
Yea mostly though their is a large Welsh settlement in Idaho though it overlaps with thr basque.,4
Ahh ok ty,1
The only thing in their house that could imply that they're Mexican is that one altar looking thing but besides that not really. As for Basil what, he's got blonde hair and blue eyes therefore automatically purely white? Y'all making some wack assumptions over headcanons that don't really matter.,-5
she could be wlw but in denial and homophobic,22
Oh seriously? Hit me with the source,3
I mean I’ve met a few wlw people who were homophobic towards gay men,2
>!yeah she does only visit outta guilt i just said that to try be a little bit funny!<,39
Everyone except Kel ,90
I mean, they accept her,3
*you have said the summoning words. filipinos will arrive shortly. prepare*,43
Inaccurate,0
nah I do agree with you. Either Filipino or Vietnamese,1
I feel like she is white to like basil,1
Yeah... no the most ppl that acept gay is catholics christians read a bible... a bit em every phobo thing you know?.. And that's the canon one for what they say so i chose to believe in nothing,8
Pretty sure Orthodox people are phobic as hell, much more than Catholics.. . Source: i lived in the predominantly Orthodox country of Romania. And now i'm trans. I had to move out to Germany to not get beaten up in school.,15
as a trans lesbian who grew up in a lutheran family, lutherans are pretty awful too.,3
Aren't most christians catholics?,4
"Not all christians are homophobic" - absolutely correct.   . "It's mostly catholics" - I feel like this is incorrect.,1
> its mostly catholics that are homophobic. . I think it's Evangelists, at least in the US,1
\*sigh\* [you're both wrong](), at least as far as the US is concerned.,1
: I'm not homophobic, it's just that the people I most hate are coincidentally very gay, that's all!,177
Oh thank god I thought this was a Amy Rose Sonadow situation.,11
No fucking way,29
IS THAT A MILWAUKEE SCREWDRIVER REFERENCE ?!,2
Could be Siberian,12
You are a tree from hell. Who are you to say what a human should be?/s,19
No,3
No it doesn’t, and no one suggested otherwise. I’m saying Latino and Hispanic or even Native Americans don’t get discriminated against on the basis of color in Asia because most of them aren’t that dark, happy?,-13
Hispanics can be literally any color, even black (source: me, and various people i know from the dominican republic and puerto rico) Can't believe this conversation has to be had tbh.,7
Hmm, that’s a cool theory. She does look pretty different from them tbh,16
Huh maybe we can reinsert Iniko into the lore and just make her bigger,1
Shhhhh... you'll summon the horde,4
Oh! I knew there was some Welsh groups in America (I actually know of an ancestor who fought in your guys civil war) but I didn’t know there was one big enough to actually be considered a Welsh area/settlement. Cool!,4
Again its not important its just hints and implications, not everyone wears their heritage as a personality trait. I also acknowledged it doesnt matter I was just curious about Aubrey because she has less to go on when it comes to indicators chill out,9
. . I do wish it was in the game but yeah there is at least official artwork of this,4
ah! sorry,17
It's Christianfobic/s. (Edit: I know how toxic my community about religion that says to love everyone and be nice is, and I am teriblly sorry for us),8
Kel lives matter ✊,20
I have arrived,19
an idiot filipino arrived >:3,10
you fool, i have already arrived.,1
no dude, most of the people that are homophobic, are the catholics, because they live by the bibles word and not the overarching message above that of "people sin, but this cool guy named jesus forgives" also as well as "yo, dont determine if someone finna go to hell bro, only god and this cool dude i mentioned before named jesus can make that decision", catholics typically dont accept that kind of thing, *typically* then theres catholics and other christians similar to me that support gay people or are like "yo do your thing",10
oh shit, well thats interesting,1
oh, im sorry that, that happened,3
yes i believe so,1
its partly correct, there are some Catholic Christians that arent homophobic, then there are some grouped up in a pile that say shit like "you'll go to hell for" and some dumb thing,1
It's complicated because evangelicalism can be used variously to describe Protestantism, a specific theological strain within Protestantism, or a quasi-political religious subculture partly rooted in a backlash to feminism and the civil rights movement.,2
,64
“Collation does not mean causation”,12
Yes fucking way,19
no its a reference to my hometown,2
Maybe, would be a weird thing for Omocat to do for representation though since Native Siberians are extremely rare in the United States (I mean I guess representation is supposed to be about minorities though so that would make sense from that perspective),2
People of any darker skin tone are discriminated against in Asia because of colorism, whether they're Latino, Asian, etc. Just look at how skin-lightening creams and sunblocks are advertised, or why people there actively try to avoid getting tanner skin. Discrimination doesn't have to be as pervasive as segregating drinking fountains for it to still be discrimination on the basis of their skin.,23
I know I think you're just being way too conclusive about it.,-5
Oh wow, a picture with two characters that look nothing like Aubrey and no actual proof of being official. Did Omocat even draw that? It's not her typical artstyle. And it's on twitter with 2 likes. Can't you send something that is actually outright Omocat?,6
There's little credibility behind this one.  The drawing is very hard to see, there is no confirmation of which characters are these,  and the source is a tweet with four likes and no replies or retweets aswell as no sources for the image shown. Calling this official confirmation is a big stretch,3
Kel lives matter! 👊🏻,3
**Who dares call us**,11
Dude catholics in eu?. I am in chile and here the catho are standing a lot about gay ppl and trans too.. I think we got a culture prob here,3
I'm not sure it's so much the religion just more the eastern mindset compared to the somewhat more modern ? I guess western mindset thinking most catholic countries are more in the west yk. Btw I am a resident of Romania just as a thing.,1
My point was, generally there are more Catholics in pro-LGBTQ countries than in anti-LGBTQ countries. In any case, saying \[insert a specific type of a religion/nationality/etc\] is more homophobic than \[insert the general religion/nationality/etc\] is never correct, especialy if you add "in fact" without noting where the information came from. Although factors such as religion could influence a person's view on this topic, there are always exceptions. I understand that there are indeed many Catholics that are anti-LGBTQ, but don't generalize please.,1
Indeed not. It means snack.,2
No I realized, I just tried to be funny.,2
Get out with that generalisation lmao, I’m Vietnamese living in Asia nearly all my life and never have I heard such dogshit take.. . No idea where the fuck you are from but pale skin whilst a physical preference isn’t the main reason why for discrimination here, it’s culture and being foreign. Just like how American used to discriminate against Italians and Irish although they were light skinned, we discriminate against each other with culture first and foremost.,-6
standing a lot??? im sorry i cant understand can you rephrase that,4
And it's not even neceseraly because of religion but nobody minds that much people making fun of and treating people like that shit. Kids aren't fucking religious 99.99% you can't fucking fool me. They're just assholes and it's not a thing that's normalized here just because it's not a western country Ig.,1
i didnt generalize i said "most" because out of my experiences with homophobic people they were mostly heavy catholic christians,1
I'm Taiwanese and I've heard enough comments from relatives about my skin being too dark to look "pretty." I'm more surprised you haven't made the connection between classism and colorism in Asia, considering that darker skin usually meant working outdoors vs paler skin being someone with like an office job....,18
Understanding I think.,1
yea, because out of my own experiences as a person in the west mostly "religious" people that would be catholic or orthordox or whatever were people who would say homophobic things like that, so it probably just is where people live,1
Have you ever gotten shit for not being able to speak Chinese? Imagine a pale skinned Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese person who doesn’t speak Chinese, vs you, a Taiwanese native that no matter how “dark” can speak Chinese going to a Chinese restaurant or looking to rent an apartment at a Chinese place, who would they favour?,-5
ah, thanks for telling me,1
Yeah, discrimination in Asian countries is a very nuanced topic - things like culture do play a part, but to pretend colorism (and colonialism) isn't at play is willful ignorance at this point. There are plenty of resources you can read up on instead of this tangent in r/Omori. Peace.,8
[removed],-4
You definitely denied skin color played a part earlier in this thread lmao. I'm not saying culture comes first either, just that it's more nuanced than Westerners tend to think. You need to educate yourself better than your little bubble of personal experience. ,9
Damn why this guy so mad like god damn.,2
Awesome cosplay!,303
Gorgeous! Aubrey's look suits you so well! And your poses and expressions make it even better. Great job!,242

Nice job! I’m surprised you managed to find her iconic clothes! Have you considered doing this again with another Omori character? My personal recommendation would be Mari, but it’s up to you!,2

Overall it looks great one big problem in my opinion is that the hair is not pink enough at least in the photos it should be more of a hot pink color but other than that slight nit pic it looks awesome,-4

Thank you so much !! And haha I wish😭❤ I didn't find the jacket anywhere and the ribbon was so hard to find so I took a basic one. I also bought a simple white jacket in which my close friend helped me sewing the sailor collar. He bought the yellow fabric to do so. And I kinda already had the rest (the skirt, the lenses, the socks and the shoes which aren't accurate lol),6

Thank you😭❤,1
Thank you so much ! I'll maybe do Mari someday...🥰,2
Thanks ! 🥰 I actually bought what you call a "bomber". Basically, I bought a cheap white jacket for like 8 dollars and then my friend bought a yellow fabric for like 3 dollars and he sewed a sailor collar on it. I also painted the sleeves and the ends of the jacket in yellow, We spent all afternoon on it lmao🤣 but I'm happy about the results. 🥰,3

Most controversial comment. Congratulations.,9
hollywood be like:. . "making original stories with non white leads is too hard, just replace our white characters to add to our diversity quota". . Edit: y'all can downvote me all you want but I didn't lie though, race swapping functionally is rebranded tokenism on the part of these studios and I'm tired of pretending it's not,-32
This joke was actually made 4 times here unfunny ass mf,23
add drugs and sex and swearing to make it more "mature and adult",7
what,33
is there a lore reason why I got downvoted for saying what??????,16
You're gonna get downvoted so bad for this 😔,9
"Nip pic" ?💀,3
i hope your pillow is always warm,3
Btw, congratumations. You're the third openly racist comment of the day ! Do you want a candy ? :3,3
I don't c-,2
Btw, congratulations. You're the third openly racist comment of the day ! Do you want a candy ? :3,2
I normally like honest opinions, but this one looks like you're just trying to make me feel insecure for no reason and well, it doesn't work.. My face is completely normal and I don't see any problems with it🥰,7
"Black person looks like someone attempting to look like a black person". . lmao slap yourself,5
She gon be black today😘😘,8
so?,7
Can we get a mod to delete this 10 year olds comment?,10
For sure, I was tryna blackface even though I'm already black lololol🤪 Have fun getting your comment removed lol,3
because,7
Phones didn't even exist in the 80s, she obviously stole Basil's camera🤷🏿‍♀,0
They've all been removed for a while now🤣,1
And I oop-,2
Yes!!! I'll be looking out for them! ,39
OH MY GOODNESS, YOU MADE THE BAT TOO?! IMPRESSIVE!!!,2

I like 4 because you're smiling, but 5 definitely has the best Aubrey Energy.,11
It's a wacky world, u were aubrey for this! The vibes were caught, idk why they expected bad comments cuz u executed well!!,20
Well you see some people are racist and hate when someone who isn’t the exact ethnicity of a character cosplays that character.,7
Ooooh they look so nice on you 💞,15
Slay queen 💅✨. . slay . . (verb). . 1. kill (a person or animal) in a violent way.,6

"gets stabbed",2
Because people who point out that your skin isn’t the same colour as Aubrey’s skin will get downvoted, and sorting by controversial let’s people see them more easily,6
Sorts by the least amount of likes a comment has,1
me too,1
Dont forget to nail it,8
None of them were deleted, we're not fucked yet,3
OF COURSE!!!! U ROCK THE AUBREY COSPLAY SO WELL OH MY GOODNESS <3333,3
They mean that this post might get locked by the mods,2
I think it all looks great in composition! And props to you guys for making it yourselves, that takes some talent :3 good job,3
If I’m being honest some of this doesn’t even look real, from how amazing it looks,2
:D,2
Cause I wanna cosplay her so bad 😭,3
It better have nails in it!,3
To kill monsters under the bed,3
You did because your cosplay is awesome :),2
Cool! Have a great day bro!!!,2
with the comments on reddit posts, you can sort by controversial, but it’s all the typically rude, off topic and bad comments,3
You're welcome! I bet you're beautiful without the cosplay too😃,2
wow, i didn't even notice that lol. it looks awesome,2
No problem :-D,2
Mood, I really want the bomber jacket but it's sold out :(,2
Yes ofc!,2
Np! . . Tbh Mari’s underrepresented in cosplay. Which is ironic considering the meaning of her character in-game lmao.,3
You both did an excellent job for sure. Thank you for the technique!,2
No prob and you did great 👍,2
EHEHHSHS YESSS :3,2
I'm just discovering Reddit 🤣🤣🤣,2
[removed],1
ofc! ,2
No problem im just stating the truth! :),2
You're welcome \^-\^ . . &#x200B;. . Ooo, noice! I wanna make a cosplay too, I tried Sunny but I can't find a black school vest like his anywhere </3 guess I'll have to buy the one that ist closest the most. I also wanna do an Aubby cosplay, I've got the skirt (gotta use belt, im too skinny lmao), I would just need the top, the massive drip tennis and the jacket, which I might make according to how you said you did it :P. . Oh and also I've gotta get a wooden baseball bat, maybe I can use it for more stuff apart from Auby cosplay hehehehehehe...,2
"Tom Holland has been casted as Sunny",18
I smell some burning liberal bottoms, protecting one stranger at all cost))),0
Nobody cares about your rant it's just a cosplay,16
yeah don't piss yourself,-2
what,4
why did the reddit hive mind downvoted you? are they stupid?,18
I think the reddit hive mind thinks your racist,7
Was it another racist comment? :/,8
I pray he meant nitpick…,3
It was a typo,1
What do you mean ?,2
What is racist in Aubrey isn't a nice person 🤨,1
Wasn't trying for anything, just saying what I thought. You do you.,-5
Tf happened? Y’all just unaware that cosplayers do blackface?. . I was just saying how with the thickness of the makeup it made me think that OP was doing blackface for some reason and it took me a bit to figure out that’s not the case,-7
I’m so sorry about him :/ he’s so annoying,4
I’m glad it was removed then,4
What did the comment say?,2
Thank you ! But I didn't make it tho, it's just a regular bat😭❤,1
I don't know if I cant put those on because I'm literally borrowing a real bat 😭,13
Did I hear a POLSKA GUROM?!! 🇵🇱🇵🇱🇵🇱,21
Oh really ? Thank you for your opinion !❤ I will try to make more of these expressions for my future pics ! Sorry to bother you but what makes it better in the last picture ? :3,8
Awe thanks !❤✨ That's so nice of you to say :3,4
Reddit comment threads have a 50% chance of being racist,6
tbh I was thinking abt pervy comments lmao,3
Thank you so much !❤❤,14
"Ugh is that a knife"  \-99 damage,2
Oh alright ! So what you mean by sorting by controversial is that you guys want to see these comment or downvote then ?,2
Me too,1
I'll see about that 😂,4
Why would some commenta be deleted ?🤔,4
THANKSS I'M DYIIING😭😭❤❤❤❤❤ SO MUCH KINDNESS IS KILLING MY HEART😭😭😭,5
Y?,1
Thank you so much !❤❤❤❤ Props mostly go to my friend who actually sewed the whole thing, he is incredible !😭😭😭,4
Oh really ? That's really nice of you to say, I wonder if I deserve auch kindness😭😭❤❤❤,2
Do it ! I believe in you ! Nothing is stopping you ! Plus, it's a rather cheap cosplay compared to the others. It didn't cost me more than 30 dollars❤,2
It will have blood on it too,2
,2
Oh I see but how do I sort by controversial ?,2
Aaah not really but tysm !🥰🥰❤❤,2
Oh you can buy a cheap one and sew the yellow collar on it !,2
Thank you and no problem ! Can't wait to see your Aubrey cosplay !🥰,2
Wha- ?,1
So nice and adorable🥰🥰❤❤❤,3
Oh I see ! But you can look the vest on cheap shops like Shein or Aliexpress ! I'm pretty sure you'll find one ! And btw, even if it doesn't look exactly like the character's, it will still look alike ! I've seen many Aubreys with different bow colors, different jackets lenghts etc but they pretty much look like Aubrey. . . I'm actually going to borrow my friends baseball bat but as I said, it doesn't really looks like Aubreys one. It's not in wood and doesn't have nails on it xD But it's still a baseball bat lol and that makes me cosplay Aubrey in a unique way !. . (Don't tell anyone but the skirt I use for Aubrey is like 8 years old lmaoo),2
This is the most terrifying sentence I’ve read today,8
What,2
it kinda makes sense if you say what like youve seen dogshit drop from  the sky,-3
Yes sadly😔 Thankfully it got removed but it's not like it was an uncommon thing, I got used to it ever since I started cosplaying. People will criticize you for the slightest things.😔,9
Same💀,1
it's a "rare" insult, since i didn't like how he was criticizing you and then claiming a "nip slip" when there was nothing close to it. i thought your cosplay was amazing!,2
Oh really ? :3 Interesting,2
Of course ! And you do you as well🥰 Have a nice day,5
So using makeup just like everyone is called blackface now huh🤔 Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for enlighting me, you're so smaaart🤪,5
Nah it's alright ! ❤🥰 I was kinda expecting it at some point lol,2
"Why is aubrey black",6
Ohh… damn… ah well… (but what if foam nails and scotch tape so it can easily come off?),6
FFS. . . POLSKA GUROM,16
Hand on the chin, a mildly annoyed, mildly bored look. The Aubrey classic.,10
Well, i expected people to be racist tbh. Guess we aint that bad tho,3
EEEEEEE U DESERVE IT ALL!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,3
Oh trust me you do,2
the slider next to the three dots in the top right corner,3
Everyone's beautiful in their own way,2
Pffffff okay x). . Welp, gonna search that vest online, cus physical there's just no way lmao,2
yes but i was making a joke. . ,6
Oh damn I’m sorry :(,9
Oh I see, thank you ! But it's okay don't worry🥰🥰,1
:3,1
I ain’t say that, just the way the makeup looks on you and the thickness of it is similar to when a lot of cosplayers do blackface. . That’s why I said I initially thought this was blackface until I realized Aubrey isn’t a black character so someone doing blackface to look like her is weird as fuck and prolly not the case. . Maybe it’s the lighting causing that effect, idk, just something about the makeup and the way it looks if it was being done by a white person would look exactly like modern blackface,-1
OH GOODNESS..,6
Why not, I'll think about it🤔 Thank you !,5
POLSKA GUROM,2
I DON'R KNOW WHAT THE HECK IT MEANS BUT. POLSKA GUROM!!!!,1
Okay thank you ! I'll keep that in mind 🥰❤❤,7
That's why mods exist x),4
Oh I just used it thank you ! It's not that bad haha, I expected more hateful comments to be honest x),2
. . Why did this guy think he could make a joke on reddit? Is he stupid?,8
Okay whatever, it's your opinion and I won't judge that. But since it's about me, I think it is irrelevant because I did my makeup properly, it doesn't look anything like weird, maybe you're just seeing things whatsoever but I'm confident, since I've been practicing makeup for more than a year, that there's nothing wrong with it ! . . Maybe I somewhat have white people's facial features that makes you think it's blackface (I honestly wonder how) but it's not ! And why did you talk about my skin colour in the first place ? You could've talked about more relevant things like saying there's a problem with my jacket, that maybe I should do certain expressions etc but no, my skin colour had to be the main subject.. . But now that it's settled, please avoid bringing such irrelevant remarks, you will only be seen as a racist redditor. And I'm not the one assuming that, but the mods probably would.,1
Crazy idea right? That a person would want to cosplay a character that technically isn't their race because they like the character? It's just silly, istg idpol gives people brainrot,3
Mhm, to my knowledge tho you can see if mods deleted a comment, that's what i meant ,3
1: There probably isn't anything wrong with your makeup but there's probably something wrong with the camera, lighting, filters, or really anything (a lot of cameras are notoriously bad at giving darker skin a splotchy look reminiscent of blackface which probably would've been ignored if cosplayers didn't have a... troubling history with blackface to say the least). . 2: To be honest I didn't really notice anything else that was wrong and this was the first thing that stood out to me as something that you might want to fix next time you cosplay. . . And I do think that this is a relevant remark because it probably indicates that you might want to spend some more time fixing up your photos to get rid of that affect so that the makeup looks more "integrated" with your face rather than sitting on top of it ig? I don't really know what that means but I hope you can catch what I'm saying. . Look, I didn't mean any harm and I was just pointing out an oddity with your cosplay that you might want to look at the reasoning behind it. Especially because if you're gonna start cosplaying as characters with melanin in them there's gonna be people who think you're genuinely trying to blackface and not bother to look through your account,0
This is mostly true but some subreddits hide them, meaning they won't show up unless someone replied to it pre-removal. I don't think that's how it's set up on this subreddit though, it just says [removed].,5
Oooh okay, well I only got comments like "Netflix Aubrey" but they got downvoted so bad I don't even see them anymore😭😂,3
And I don't care about what people say, I do my thing and that's it. Yeah thanks for you opinion or whatever but mine counts first ! Yeah there's probably a filter, I used lights and just like every cosplayer does ! Sorry for not having a 4000$ camera or the latest iphone to give off a better quality. I did my best and I'm proud. Imagine being me though, spending an entire day to craft your costume, assembling the outfit, putting on the makeup for some pics, taking an hour to get the best angles only for a random redditor to say you look like a blackface. --,1
Ohhh ok, thanks for explaining ,4
Oh, i wont lie i do find that funny tho as long as it's done with good spirit. Ofc if ya rude with it than it's cringe,3
You’re welcome ,4
I actually don't mind them xD I took it as a compliment because that means I could actually get in a Netflix show🥰,3
Ayy now that's the kind of mindset i like,3
Sunny needs to take a McChillpill smh,327
I want to see more of this McAU,171
Item name: McG Uniform. . Item type: Charm. . Effects: +25 Juice, -50 Heart, -5 Speed, +10 Defense, +20 Attack. The wearer starts FURIOUS in battle.. . Description: A worker's uniform from the popular restaurant found all across Headspace, McGino's. You hear the silent screams of un-satisfied customers by simply looking at the attire.,97
Kel: “Sally and I are trapped in the McDonald’s play place. We’re currently in the bubble facing the dining area. Do you see us waving to you? Please send help, we haven’t eaten our order yet.”,60
Tagging it to see if it loads later,36
It's only a matter of time until a McFanfic is made about this.,29
It is terrifying seeing Aubrey, the angry girl with a nailbat being scared of Sunny.,27
Loving this.,23
Sunny: ¡¡I'm goin to (MA)MCSSACRE YOU UP KEL!!.. . Kel: ¡¡oh shit oh shit!! ***\*******starts running for his Mclife\****. . Aubrey: \*Mc sigh\* here we go again.. . I can't handle this, it's so hilarious XD,13
This is a nightmare of a work situation, Aubrey is having a seizure after drinking to many McCoffe and working 24 hours per day while Sunny is having having suicidal thoughts while working in McDonalds and Kel is just doing McDonalds jokes.,10
AYO!!! Thank you so much for this! ❤️,9

HOW DID I NOT REALIZE KEL WAS SAYING MC BEFORE EVERYTHING.. . I'm too dumb for this app, I though sunny was just stabbing kel cause hes kel,3
I can see Sunny having anger issues since he’s not used to showing emotions.,3
I do feel like Sunny would work his first job at a mcdonalds though,2
This is delightful. Thank you for your service!,2
uhhh hello can i get a McSunny thanks,2
 I didn't know I would see the day where Sunny is angrier than Aubrey,2
McStop. . McSunny!,2
Question, where original post?,3
Surprised Aubrey isn't gonna snap too,1
Can someone translate what sunny said in the first image?,1
touchy today, arent we sunny?,1
I would be angry too if I was getting paid minimum wage and being treated like scum by both customers and higher ups. Does it sound like I am venting because I am venting.,1
Au where Sunny works at Mcdonalds. He is now an Edgy edgelord XD,1

"Earthbound-based RPG about depression". . and this happens to be the only game that fits this affirmation,229
ost 172 on its way to appear in my youtube feed and ruin my day,190
You before playing the funny depression game: . . You after:. . ,113
YEEES I LOVE TO SEE MENTALLY STABLE PEOPLE BREAK,120
Tbh not alot of games make my cry, it's really hard for me to cry in general.. . But this game, got atleast one tear outta me,77
Over time it’s taken less out of a story to make me cry, but only two games have made me full on ugly cry, and that’s Omori and Undertale Yellow. Honestly the night I finished omori is an unforgettable experience.,35
Meanwhile insane people: kelkelkelkel,31
Omori just has that effect on people.. . I wasn't that surprised to figure out that being depressed for a week after finishing it was a sort of "rite of passage" in the community.,26
The sanity of a mentally sane person versus the unmatched trauma of playing Omori,20
This game made me sentimental and made me rethink aspects of life,16
>!Thats so real, I ugly cried when they forgot Basil.!<,13
Earthbound-inspired RPGs about depression list:. 1. Omori. 2. Heartbound. 3. Lisa(?). 4. ???. 5. Index out of Bounds. . . So many huh,4
Yeah this is exactly how I started off haha. Started the game a few weeks ago and finished it earlier this week, had me crying like 4 separate times, and I rarely cry at media in general. Pretty amazing experience.,3
I’ll be honest. I never cried playing omori.,3
It's so funny how people can't see a pixel art style anymore without getting bent,2
Y’all are not insane,2
bro got pfp with justice . . &#x200B;. . my respect is higher then drug addicts,2

I read Punpun and  played Omori for recreation.. . What does that say about me?,1
Helltaker pfp spotted!!!,1
I'm not sane. This game absolutely broke me because I relate to Mari in MANY ways... you can figure out the rest.,1

To this day I do not know how I didn’t cry,1

And that's my story of "why do i like OMORI",1
(Worst mistake in my life),146
Didn't Omocat take some inspiration from this one for Omori?,16
What a cute cover! I wonder what wholesome story is behind it 😇 (I genuinely don’t know and am afraid to ask),5
Where do you buy this book I wanna read it now lol,7
Dang, this was next on my list of "to read",3
A wholesome manga to read with ur family 😀😀😀😀😀,2
nah what the fuck did you recommend me bro this shit took like 3 years off my life why the fuck did i read this,2
I want to read it,1
what a good meme bro,1
Time to read this then,1
I fear this book,1
I kinda want to read this since I’ve heard good things about it.,1
I haven't played Lisa: The Painful yet, but does that also fit?,54
omori is about more then just depression,7
omori isnt about depression,-26
Me finishing berserk vol 13 be like : . . . Reading wholesome manga of a silly bird also didn't help it,7
Give me your listolas, new St. Nicholas. . >!what games made you cry is what I'm asking!<,20
have you heard of To the Moon?,2
Same here,2

Kel Nye the Science Guy,3
Same here, but I'm not sure if it's for better or worse ,8
I didn't cry, but I involuntarily yelled "NO!" when >!Kel kicked away the flower crown.!<,3
That's okay, it hits some notes that might not be particularly sensitive to you. Sorry if you came into it intending to cry though.,3
Same. I still think it’s an amazing game, I just don’t cry to games very often. Game got me teary-eyed a few times tho, but no tears left my eyes.,1
Might read. Thoughts on the manga?,81
U may need this in the end ➰➰➰➰,3
I dunno, I'm a practitioner of the truest way of reading manga.... . Surrounded by less than desirable ads of you know what.,17
Lisa the Painful is about *a lot* more than just depression, but it *will* fuck you up mentally.,62
I haven't played it either, but I think yes,6
I haven't finished it, but it doesn't seem to be about depression whatsoever, just extremely dark and depressing.,4
Um... It's literally about a depressed kid that has a dream world,32
did lil bro play the game,25
it isnt about depression its a theme but it isn't about it if that makes sense,1

God of War Ragnarok was the closest to having me bawl my eyes out.. . Elden ring felt fulfilling . . >!Oneshot. It was so hard saying goodbye to Niko!<,12

KEL NYE THE SCIEEEENCEE3 GUYYYY. . KEL KEL KEL KEL! ,1
 i still liked the game regardless so it’s fine.,2
its good but it’s really fucked up. i wouldn’t recommend it to everyone,126
I don't recommend it if you're already on the edge mentally,38
Probably the most fucked up thing I've read (very very good and thought provoking),38
It’s very well executed but very depressing. It does not inspire a lot of faith in humanity, but does tell very human stories of a variety of people.,29
or you could use mihon,3
There's a lot more than just depression as well around it, addiction is another big thing as well as trauma from both past and present sources. It's a game where you do need to take the content warning seriously if you're sensitive to any topics at all.,5
 i guess depression could be counted as a theme but it isnt a main theme,-13
its about grief trauma guilt and forgivenesss coming terms with yourself and your past,4
i guess depression could be counted as a theme but it isnt the main theme,2
Put a spoiler alert on the last sentence ,2
you play as two scientists whose job it is to alter a dying man's memories to make him think he went to the moon.,9
I would recommend it to everyone.. . (I am evil and want everyone to become irreversibly depressed.),101
[removed],1
That narrows it down so much mate . . It's about despair despair and despair only,8
>mihon. . wish they had desktop app, lol,2
What is it mainly about then?,2
Hear me out. . It's all three and more?,12
Oh God that's sad,. . Is it on steam?,5
Reading it now thanks,9
You should read The Children of Hurin by JRR Tolkien! It's a super epic prequel to Lord of the Rings! ;),1
I can think of stories that are very human and uplifting, and stories that are uplifting and feel fake. There are stories that are despairing that only focus on how horrible humanity is, and I don’t think Punpun is that exactly… instead it’s more focused on how humans are self-centered, sometimes cruel, sometimes kind. Not putting us in a box of evil, but just realistically depicting cruelty as well as kindness. . . The story is sad because the MC’s mental illness makes him feel so disconnected from other people that he feels like another species, and the moments where he actually feels human are inevitably followed by the cold “reality” that he isn’t “human” at all. He himself is self-centered, he does kind things for bad reasons, he does bad things for good reasons. It’s a real story, but what happens to him over time is simply sad. . . A story just about despair is a comedy. A story about hope and joy that’s constantly cut short is a tragedy. It’s not just despair on despair. There are moments of light, connection, and hope. That’s what makes it such a memorable series.,19
The main theme is definitely trauma and coming to terms with yourself.. . Depression is a theme but not the main one.,16
I guess trauma?,2
yes,3
yes,3
Oh trust me,you won't be thanking me by the end of it.,15
Yeah agreed . . Still this is the manga that people with depression and mental health issues should stay away from , . . I swear to god I would even recommend berserk coz yeah it's no joke on how depressing it can be also , but it's also motivating in brutal way,5
Sick,3
Good to know 😔,6
I think that series like this are most relatable for people who have mental health issues or depression. It can provide a great outlet and people who have dealt with those problems will probably understand the story better than those who have never experienced it. To be honest, in my opinion, a series like this would probably make someone in crisis feel seen or like they’re not alone before it made things worse, but maybe I’m naive or wrong about that… . . I absolutely love Berserk and love that you brought it up as a comparison, since it’s ultimately it’s about the struggle (ha) of dealing with depression and making a choice to live, center the people you love, fight the part of you that tells you to give up, and survive another day. Imo one of those most 1-1 allegories for suicidal depression in modern manga. . . Have you read Fire Punch? If you like Punpun and Berserk I think you would enjoy it. I read it and ended up reflecting on and writing about what it meant to me for quite a while.’,9
you gonna play it?,3

Great ship. I enjoy it. It's not on my top 3 because I like MarixHero, space pirates ship and last resort more,420
I don't really care that much about shipping, though I will admit that Sunburn is the "path of least resistance", or in this case requires the least amounts of head cannons to make it work. Unlike the other pairings, the game already heavily established that, at least at one point, Sunny had a huge crush on Aubrey. While it's debatable whether that crush remains, there's still a decent amount of "maybe platonic, maybe romantic" dialogue that Aubrey says to Sunny.  . . . While Hero/Mari could be considered the true path of "least resistance", I could hardly call that a ship as much as it is just the cannon relationship these two characters had.,376
Auby :),454
Angery girl who has a soft spot for the quiet boy who is babied by everyone in the friend group but especially by her. He admires her she thinks he is adorable and cool. They are so cute,577
[SOURCE](),130
Neither of them are ready for a relationship yet, they need therapy ,126
I just think they are neat,173
Its a closure type of ship, man simped for her to the point of making her simp for him in headspace, and to realize despite everything they do love each other....👌,236
Because it feels like the only ship with evidence behind it, other then hero x mari,240
I don't really care about shipping,282
[deleted],45
[removed],35
Don't care about the ship, only friendship. I really doubt both can be together after what happened, they need years to deal their problems before starting a relationship. In my part, I prefer them being friends,73
It's decently close to canon as its hinted at during the game that aubrey has a crush on sunny, and its clear that sunny at least used to have a crush her, so he might still have one. Also cuz it makes auby happy and when auby happy auby gaming,50
Their dynamic is cute, and i feel Aubrey would forgive Sunny faster for the accident because she herself almost did the exact same thing if Basil wasn't saved.. . Feel she could empathize a lot with Sunny, and them becoming close friends and maybe starting to like each other is just adorable,17
I just don't like the idea of shipping Sunny/Basil with anyone at all, including each other. I think in term of emotional maturity and vulnerability, they aren't really ready for those kind of relationship. Maybe let them heal first.,34
It's not necessarily about the ship itself, but I feel like this sub is oversaturated with Sunburn posts. I like it and everything, but imo posts should be a bit more diverse.  . Also blessed.,147
Sunny's memories of crushing on Aubrey (in the lost library and memory lane) just break my heart. I also love the dynamic of the two, with Sunny helping to keep quick-to-anger Aubrey calm and grounded in times she wants to assault someone with her bat (think the swingset chat) and quiet, don't-want-to-be-a-bother Sunny having someone who will beat the crap out of anyone who approaches him. Win win scenario.,13
Personally not a fan, as I just dislike real world Aubrey as a character. I'm also just not a fan of "rebel/delinquent" archetypes.,13
I just think it’s cute ,26
I feel they don't have much chemistry. In real world they've interacted only for 3 days after not seeing each other in over 4 years and have enough issues on their own, so pairing up two mentally unwell people with polar opposite personalities is a recipe for disaster, in my opinion.. . Plus, it feels too "unrealistic" for this to happen: guy who's been fantasizing about dating a girl while doing nothing for it suddenly gets her attention after meeting for the first time in a while because... what exactly? I don't say that Aubrey doesn't think about Sunny and her former friend group at all, but she's most likely moved on and has no interest in them,28
i feel like sunburn would probably be the most possible ship if accurate to the game. but i also really like the fanart that people make of it, it's cute and wholesome :),21
In the game, it feels like it’s just a one sided crush Sunny has on Aubrey. I mean one of the stories in the lost library is about Sunny liking Aubrey, and Aubrey is obsessed with omori in his dreams, but when you get to the real world, nothing really happens. . . The only “signs” she likes him too is caring about his health by asking if he’s eating enough, and asking to stay in contact/visit soon. I feel like friends would do that anyway and it’s nothing special. The ship is cute in theory, but I don’t think it would actually happen.,35
i like sunburn as a concept, because they can be cute together, but i kind of don't like how people treat the characters in order to make it work a lot of the time.. . to me, it doesn't make sense that >!after 4 years of being separated, aubrey moving on and growing as a person, sunny... not moving on or growing at all, that they could just develop the exact same childhood crush and have that be considered healthy. it feels like people are treating it like just because sunny had a crush on aubrey, that means it's still definitely gonna happen 4 years later.!<. . also, sometimes sunburn fans go out of their way to try and cement their ship as "canon" (or "probably canon") due to evidence that i find shaky at best. aubrey blushes and gets flustered when she's emotional, and it doesn't really seem like it's specifically due to sunny. also her glancing toward sunny at picnics and giving sunny an emotional talk on the swings is... maybe it's something, but it's really not conclusive evidence for me at all.. . i like sunburn content when it actually feels in-character, and more like an actual developing teen friendship. that's really the thing, i think, i need to be convinced that their friendship is strong first before i can be convinced they have a good romance. they were apart for so long that i just can't see a romance developing instantly like that.,18
awwww,7
I just don't like Aubrey,48
Ah, Sunburn. It's a nice ship, but I really prefer Sunflower. Here's why. . . It can sometimes feel like Sunny only likes Aubrey because she's "the girl." Next to Basil and Kel, Aubrey seems a bit more distant from Sunny in real life-- she was closer to Mari than she really was to him as a kid. If we're looking at this from a thematic point of view, Sunflower and Suntan can be used in fics to emphasize certain of the story's themes: Sunflower for tragedy, fate, and exploration of the Incident; Suntan for healing, recovery, and how to take care of your loved ones. It's not as easy to show these things with Sunburn because Aubrey is not as central to the plot as Kel or Basil are (The Incident would never have happened without Basil, while the Sunny Route depends on Kel. Without Aubrey, sad to say, not too much would change.). . That said, the character dynamic when isolated from the story is excellent. Aubrey's more assertive personality can be a good match for Sunny's quiet nature. They're both broken, but they express their pain and loss differently, which allows them to help each other balance things out. Aubrey knows how to deal with loss and grief, and she's felt the same sort of anger that led Sunny to the Incident so she'd be able to to understand him. She seems like the most in touch with reality of the group, aside from perhaps Kel. Also, she is a girl and Sunny definitely likes girls, so.,13
I just want Sunny to have something go right for him. I also think Aubrey is the only one besides Basil who can really understand him.,6
I don’t like it because they’re barely close most of the present time. Basing a ship off a silly childhood crush just seems weird to me.,23
I generally think it’s cute. but i just feel it suffers from “most popular ship cause it’s the only straight one” syndrome. And I don’t think they are perfect together romantically but Ships aren’t meant to be Cannon so I don’t mind. So i think it’s overrated but it’s still nice and I don’t have anything against the people who love it,27
Why I Like Sunburn : it's semi-canon  . Why I Dislike Sunburn : Sunny stabbed Auby  . Why I Love Sunburn : It's super cute  . Why I Hate Sunburn : Sunny and Kel actively disrupt Auby's privacy,5
i like sunburn bc they have a lot in common. . * they like capt. spaceboy & video games. * they have bad/neglectful parents. * they aren't very good at dealing with their emotions. * both of them fuck up, and in almost identical ways. * ~~thinking basil is sus~~. . i do think aubrey is/was closet to sunny after basil and mari, [for reasons i laid out elsewhere](). . > she's willing to apologize to him first and alone on the swings (if you actually get that scene), notices how thin and pale Sunny is before anybody else does and encourages him to take care of himself, randomly peeps at him in different scenes with the group, etc. Not to mention setting aside hours to talk to each other on the swings as kids. There can be platonic reasons for all of those, but I think there's enough for something more.. . while i think people making up scenarios where they get together during the in-game timeline is cute, i don't think things would go that fast; it has been four years after all and they have stuff they need to work on. so i think any relationship that develops would have to take place after the game.. . >!some folks argue that after the truth of mari's death is revealed, any kind of relationship between the two would be impossible. i think the opposite is true. aubrey's character arc involves her coming to realize that she should have been more understanding toward basil for him allegedly blacking out the photo album; it's because she wasn't that she wound up throwing out their entire friendship for years in favor of bullying him. for that matter, it's because she wasn't understanding enough that she is partly responsible, as she admits at the tree stump, for how the friend group broke up after her death, and in particular not being there for sunny. and all those realizations also took almost pulling a sunny and pushing basil down toward what would have been his death (and indirectly sunny's himself, since he jumped in to try and save him). more than any other character, aubrey is in the best position to understand sunny; i would like to think that's something she would try and commit to despite the truth. there's no better person to vent to about all your problems than someone who shares many of the same problems and i think they'd both find some level of catharsis just being able to talk about it with someone who knows what that feels like, even if it's hard at first. this doesn't mean she forgives him instantly or doesn't get super pissed at the hospital, but i don't think it would take very long for her to come around. !<,5
Love: Nothing really. . Like: it has it's hints, I still don't really like the ship that much but it's still a plus.. . Dislike: a lot of the sunburn shippers are kinda annoying, I don't feel motivated enough to explain the reasons here but I think you can get the point.. . Hate: Also nothing.,9
I think it's healthier than Sunflower,10
It lets me ship basil and Kel,9
I think they're not really made for each other, and the crush that Sunny had, doesn't exist anymore (therapy is the best ship),13
I think the reason I don’t like this ship is because the Aubrey that Sunny is in love with isn’t the same as current Aubrey. Aubrey has drastically changed after everything while he stayed locked away in his room. . . Also we’re never given any indication that Aubrey had a crush on him as a kid. So it seems more one sided. . . I think part of Sunny healing and moving on from everything (rather then hiding away in his fantasy world). Is accepting who Aubrey is now and moving on from his crush.. . Also I headcanon that Aubrey is a lesbian. . . Note: I don’t care if people ship it! It’s just not for me personally.,22
[removed],14
Could've halved that title by just asking for opinions on it lol.,4
Snuuy and obby,5
Like --> it's cute and auby tsundere +canon points. Dislike --> its TOO cute,3
favorite part: they'd have a LOT to work out to actually be a reasonable possibility, imo. arguably more than any other mainstream Sunny ship. i think that gives it an interesting challenge for writers and authors to genuinely work for if they want to portray a realistic post-hospital version of them.. . least favorite part: the game basically doesn't give any clear indicators this is an option until Memory Lane. everything else is probably going over people's heads without hindsight (or without figuring out how lost library's namecode works by yourself).. . &#x200B;. . not my favorite ship but i think that's mostly because i was too deep in to be saved by the time i realized it existed-,4
It used to be a resounding meh for me, but I lowkey hate it these days lmao. I don’t think it’s healthy (and not in an interestingly unhealthy way, like some other ships I’ve looked into), their dynamic bores me (angry girl x quiet guy has never appealed to me, nor the constant infantilization of Sunny because “uwu autism-coded boy has to be treated like a child”), and I dislike sunburn fans after spending a few months in this fandom. It feels like Aubrey’s delinquency is often glorified and Sunny is made to act like a six year old in the sunburn I’ve seen. I’ve also quite frequently seen it called “canon,” but it isn’t and being canon doesn’t make a ship good. Forcing yourself to stick to canon crushes or relationships feels restrictive and boring imo.. . Edit: scrolled through the comments and wanted to add a little more. It doesn’t feel that thematically relevant aside from a few parallels, Aubrey is likely to have moved on (if she even had a crush on Sunny) considering that it’s been four years, and she has little reason to get hung up on a childhood crush the way Sunny did (who had no real perception of time during his isolation). I also forgor to explain one of the other reasons why I dislike sunburn shippers, which is the fact that a lot of them feel like they’re projecting their desire to date Aubrey onto Sunny + the fact they constantly shit on other ships (and the occasional bout of genuine homophobia/transphobia I’ve seen).,5
I just don’t like seeing any sex. Wholesome bonding is okay.,6
Love the ship, not a huge fan of the shippers.. . I don't wanna get too into it, but it's kind of annoying seeing some Sunburn fans shit on every single other pairing involving Sunny or Aubrey, particularly Sunflower. I mean, I'd argue there's move evidence that Basil has feelings for Sunny than Aubrey does, even though I ship both (plus Suntan as well.). . I mean, my favorite ship is Cactiflower, which is Kel x Basil. So obviously I'm gonna enjoy Sunburn as well. But I think I'd like it more if people weren't so rude about it.,6
ive always interpreted it as onesided as of current (when their 16). Sunny may have held onto that string but i doubt aubrey did, lol. it could happen post canon dont get me wrong but i highly doubt aubrey has held romantic feelings for him for all these years, if whatever Sunny had going on even counts as such?? who knows if he holds holds them or if hes just holding onto something from his past. It really can be taken whichever way you want, if i recall correctly. . . I havent played the game in awhile, so correct me if im wrong.. . In the end though if your asking for my opinion on it, as much as i sound like a grumpy grandpa i just dont really care for it. Its ok and i can respect it, ive just always gravitated towards sunny x kel more, or just their friendship, platonic or romantic idrc i just think their neat. But i feel like a asshole shoving my shipping preferences in here.. oh well.,8
I think it's a great dynamic between the "cool" girl with a soft spot and the weak and soft boy,3
This ship is perfection,3
I never understood the ship but I replayed the game and got to the couch that was in front of the sun and then saw Aubrey rest her head on Omori's shoulder and instantly just understood why people shipped these two.,3
I don’t like the ship because honestly even in the game it feels like sunny stabbing Aubrey was forgotten way too fast,3
After the reveal I think it's impossible, as I feel like Aubrey has the greatest change of a very negitive reaction,3
Aubrey is lowkey just my least favorite character. She makes Sunny, Basil, and Kel's lives more miserable throughout the game. She tries to beat Sunny and Kel up three different times throughout the game (two of the times are in very public areas). She is a shit person but the fandom completely forgives her "because she's sad". So yeah. I'm not a fan of this ship.,3
Well as much as it is obvious in canon stuff, I really liked how their dynamic just works. An angry loud energetic girl with a quiet guy who supports her with a headband and glowsticks is quite cute. Even with all of the true ending stuff, I feel like they would be a great couple and very healthy. They just give off a supporting rational bf, and energetic "I will end your bloodline and erase your name from the world" chaotic gf.  Very much a comfort ship,3
Ewww straight ppl /nsrs. . No huge issue really, other than I don’t believe Aubrey likes sunny,3
i do not like the ship itself, and i do not like aubrey. i feel like they're a good platonic otp, but not a romantic otp. i just can't get why a quiet, shy, and very traumatized boy can start a relationship with a girl with severe anger issues. i also don't think their relationship is possible after sunny tells the truth. aubrey probs will be really pissed. . plus i don't like aubrey, she's too impulsive and angry to me.. I don't think she'd make a great match with sunny. i think sunny needs someone a little bit quieter and aubrey needs someone who actually can deal with her.. plus i don't really like the popularity of the ship. its fans can sometimes be annoying and comment about sunburn under a post with another otp. . yeah i get that sunny had a crush on her but it was just a childhood thing and it never actually was mutually.. . so, it looks cute, but i really do not like it.,6
don't really like it nor dislike it, just can't see them together. feels like a one-sided childhood crush to me,4
I dont like it together but i love the characters separate.. . . . . . I ship Sunflower so...,3
Its one-sided and probably not even a crush anymore so lol,10
the dynamic and overall ship is really cute   . the only thing i dislike is probably aubrey lol,5
I feel like of the available Sunny ships it's the one that'd be least likely to happen, which I guess is why I dislike it. . . While we obviously don't know what happens post good ending, it's not too farfetched to assume that Aubrey probably goes back to hating Sunny for awhile. And even if she eventually stops hating him again, there'd definitely be residual resentment towards him that would never fully disappear, enough to prevent any real relationship.,7
Tbh I have no problem with the ship, I think it's decent. :),2
I Just like the ship, thats all,2
The thing I like the most (This applies to pretty much any ship) is just all the adorable and/or funny fanart that people make it’s so great,2
[deleted],2
i like their character design,2
I like the art,2
Aubrey ,2
I just think they're neat,2
So i definitely think its a cute ship. I am a much bigger fan of Sunflower than sunburn but i still like it. There is proof there was something before that Sunny did have and thats good proof. . My reasons for disliking it is because i think Aubrey seems to be much closer to Kim now, not saying she likes Kim but theyre obviously close and shes moved on from him a bit. All we know about Sunnys crush is that it was in the past and nothing seems to be anything in the future. Aubrey does beat him up and we stab her so to me i cant see them doing either of these things if there were feelings there. Plus i just think Sunflower just has more evidence, not as concrete but i think the quantity is just there.,2
Honestly, I don’t mind sunburn, I don’t ship it though, mainly because well- they attacked each other, though we know that sunny specifically stabbed her, that just doesn’t sit right with me, but you can ship them, not gona loose my crap on anyone, some of the dynamics I see are cute though,2
Best ship in the history of ships.,2
The little crush Sunny had on her when young was cute to see, and in current time it’s nice to see her worry about Sunny on the swing and before going to his backyard.,2
If you genderbent them it’d be the most cliche pair ever. Tough bad boy with quiet girl who can’t really stand up for herself. . . What’s even better is that these two characters on their own are totally realistic. Sunny fulfills a male archetype that you see all the time. The quiet nerd kid. Same with aubrey, who is akin to the female goth girl archetype (note that the archetype specific to Aubrey is not as common as Sunny’s, however assertive, rebellious girls who fear vulnerability do exist as an archetype).,2
>!I like how could be canon, since in the memory lane, Basil kinda confirms that Sunny has a crush on Aubrey, and in the real world, she gives some signs that it could reciprocate, but I hate that we'll know that because Sunny either dies or moves out before we even have the chance to confirm it.!<,2
This ship screams Shinji/Asuka to me, and well, Omocat is a fan of Evangelion, so the influence feels pretty intentional, imo.,2
Dislike: its not sunflower,2
I like the childhood friends dynamic a lot. I also think it's cute. I also like the idea that the main cast starts a D&D campaign and Sunny is the DM.,2
I'm not the biggest fan of shipping in any fandom I'm in (unless the art is cute hehe). . But in this case I ship Aubrey and Sunny with therapy, as I don't think either of them are ready yet (but let's be honest none of the gang are ready),2
I hate the fact that it's named "Sunburn" (GD referens),2
It's Canon mainly (them being actually together is something I'm unaware of or unsure) i couldnt care less for a ship if it's just "omg they are literally talking". I will always greatly prefer canon ships if it's not "forced" it feels more human to want someone and it can actually enhance gameplay and/or lore.,2
i like it, but, i hate when the shipers start saying shit about my ship,2
It's cute and canon,2
i love girlboss and malewife trope,2
Its not a bad ship but it just doesnt hit as hard as sunflower or suntan,2
Well I don't really ship in the romantical way, more like platonic way,2
I used to think it was a little one sided until I remembered in headspace Omori practically reveals he’s aware of Aubrey liking him. He also sends the heart when they do a chain attack. ,2
definitely has the most evidence for being canonical. only ship besides mario that makes sense. [I made a video detailing what I believe should happen after the game]() and Aubrey would fit well in this sense,2
Ah yes, let me just ship the character who's rude to her childhood friends at best, violent at worst, and the kid that had a crush on her when he was 12. Totally makes sense.. . It's also kinda boring. For the set up, there's not much you can write with this that you can't do with literally any other ship in anything.,2
Ik im gonna get attacked but i hate it sm, sunny and Aubrey talked for the first time in 4 years and Aubrey changed a lot, i don’t think sunny would like her and she was super rude. Ive honestly always hated this ship with a burning passion,3
This isn't really anything against the ship, but instead the shippers (not all ofc!). But I've lost count of the amount of times I post Sunflower content on my socials and I'll get comments like "This is toxic". Then when I click to see their posts they have Sunburn posted, which would be just as toxic without therapy. . . Tbh this kinda hypocrisy is in the whole fandom, not just (some) Sunburn shippers (｡•́︿•̀｡). . I wish this fanon knew how to interact with ships more appropriately and nicely. Instead of constantly attacking and arguing against those who ship different things then us. My rule is I'll always support someone's ship as long as it's not illegal!,3
My headcanon is that sunny is bi so i prefer sunflower,5
I don't like Aubrey and feel like Sunny could do better.,3
I hate that Aubrey isn't Basil >:(,3
i just stay out of shipping because there is always that one psychotic shipper out there...... . art pretty cute though lol,2
LA MORTE UMANA . . I BAMBINI MORTI . . LE BORSE SPARISCONO GLI UMANI MUOIONO. . IO VOGLIO METRI CUBI DI RADIAZIONI E CACCA,2
it's actually kind of impossible to happen in the true canon of Omori. I think >!Aubrey and everyone would forgive Sunny and Basil but not enough so they continue to be friends. I'm just being realistic.!<,2
Uhm well i see Aubrey as a lesbian so I really don’t like that ship at all,2
It’s not a bad ship I just don’t ship it tho,1
I think they were cute when they were younger, but they lack development between each other when they’re older. They both also have their issues and trauma which they need to work out which can be harmful in the relationship. So it’s kind of an odd ship to me. Though I wouldn’t be opposed to it being canon, and I’d like to think that Sunny and Aubrey got to re-connect after he moved away…maybe there is potential for them to actually get together after a few years,1
Sunny x Basil is too cute for anything else to exist,2
I despise Sunburn. It is one of the worst Omori ships and I will forever be the leafy of Sunburn.,-2
Sunburn is well and good, but I like Kelbrey ,1
its cute i just dont think they work so well together,1
Imo, it’s a pretty healthy ship. It’s probably canon since in the >!rain memory of memory lane, some bonus dialogue confirms that Sunny had a crush on Aubrey in the past, although we don’t know if he still has it now!< so yeah, pretty cute and healthy overall 9/10,1
I’m not a big fan of shipping in general, but I just don’t really like how one-sided it is. Sunny used to have a crush on her as a much younger child, and his inner self still projects onto who the two of them were in the past. I don’t think there’s much actual chemistry between them.. . Then again, however, I do generally have pretty unpopular ship opinions. While I don’t really care that much about any of the ships, I personally am more inclined to like the idea of Sunny and Basil someday ending up together, since I’m a sucker for mutual healing. Overall, though, I much prefer thinking about all of the characters’ platonic bonds.,1
Hi, new to the fandom and all I have to say is THEIR SHIP IS CALLED SUNBURN??? THATS ODDLY SO CUTE.,1
Everything about it. They are nothing alike and sunny acts more affectionate towards basil than anyone else!,1
I mean it’s cannon,-2
Sunny and Aubrey are both broken people and they can connect better than the rest of the group.. . Bonus points: Shipping Sunny and Basil is a disaster waiting to happen.,0
After what Aubrey did to Basil I don't think she deserves any love or happiness whatsoever . . Kelbrey is still cute tho,-5
I like that its cute, i dislike that it will never come true,0
Aubreys behavior towards Sunny when he wanted her to stop bullying Basil,-2
I get why peoples like it but I find this ship a little cliché, and i like more ships like Kel x Aubrey and Sunny x Basil but if you like it and make you happy then more power to you,-1
[deleted],-6
Because I can't not see Aubrey as a lesbian. That picture with Kim is very gay and I'm all about it. I mean, it's not Sunny Aubrey's holding bridal style in official art.... . Edit : Man, I miss when you could say something gay in this subreddit and not get downvoted...,-4
I like it but am more into Sunny/Basil tbh, I feel like Kel and Aubrey make more sense together,0
I’m gay and I relate to sunny so I say he’s gay so is Aubrey bc I said so,0
I just hate to see bottom Auby so that mean im ok with Aubrey x Sunny, not Sunny x Aubrey. Still, mostly i hate sunburn,-4
I mean they never address the fact sunny attacks her with a knife at that one point cause whoops I suppose.,-1
it cute but hetero ships are yucky,-17
King and queen daddy issues together at last.,1
I just like tough girls and emos.,1
it is alright i guess,1
Tomboy X brave, sensitive boy.. . No I won't nor need to elaborate,1
Sunny can't be with anyone in the series because he moves but it's still cute,1
I love that it’s a Pink + Dark character duo,1
It's cute ig,1
I'm not too big on shipping if I want to be completely honest- I like the art though, it's pretty cute ! ,1
They both flat.,1
I have 0 knowledge on them; deliver your best case and ill decide.,1
I think it's okay since Sunny had a crush on Aubery.,1
It would be cute, but I can't really fathom either sunny (or basil) being in a serious relationship anytime soon post-game and not without lots of therapy lol. Besides, I prefer ✨️cotton candy✨️ 💕💙,1
auby just aubys the snuuy also does aubys and auby is snuuy,1
Well, they are my 2 favorites characters so, yea. And i think they are great together.. . ( Aubrey is really cute ),1
I understand it and think it could canonically work, but I hate it when people oversimplify Sunny and Aubrey to “depressed quiet emo kid” and “tough edgy tsundere girl”. Sunburn could totally make sense, but I have yet to see a fanart or fanfic surrounding it that doesn’t misinterpret Sunny, Aubrey, or both.,1
Close,1
Everything,1
I love everything about it kek,1
,1
it's really cute but idk I like suntan more 😎,1
girlboss x malewife ships 😍,1
I don't really like it. Gets annoying how much of the ship I see on this subreddit as well. Those two have way too many mental issues they gotta work out first before they even consider dating at all, much less each other.. . The only universe I can see Sunny and Aubrey being a couple is if >!Mari was still alive!<. Other than that, I just don't see Sunny making a conscious effort to stay in touch with Aubrey after he moves, much less try to date her.,1
i like the ship on paper, but similarly to sunny x basil, it'd seem like there's almost no communication between them due to their psychological and emotional health. although it's my least favorite of the normal sunny ships, i feel like sunny x kel would be the healthiest.,1
I don’t like Aubrey,1
Love it, I love Aubrey and sunny so much,1
That they don't actually start dating in the game. . Edit: this is something I dislike about it,1
It’s adorable, both in fanon and canon. Don’t know what more can be said.. . . Also aubrey is ho-,1
Sunburn makes my skin red and it hurts a lot :( i've had sunburn so bad that i couldn't sleep,1
it's not sunflower,1
I love sunnyxaubrey because sunny and omori are main characters that you play as and I would have a crush on aubrey and sunny and omori like aubrey so it all works out,1
I don’t ship.,1
Yes,1
idk toast on butter is better then having a gf,1
Fuckin W, > sunflower,1
1. They're children. That's all I need to say,1
Delinquent x whatever Sunny is, because I can’t quite find the right word, is really nice.,1
Sunny always looks confused/natural and for some reason I love it,1
reject lgbtq ships fuck off basil sunny x aubrey is fucking canon,1
I don't ship anyone except MarixHero and EveryonexTherapy,1
I think it’s really cute when they were young and in hs, but aubrey ends up bullying his best friend when they’re older. that’s quite a turn-off.,1
I love the art. Do you know who's the artist?,1
What did i just joined,1
The fact that there’s a chance sunny doesnt like Aubrey anymore or that Aubrey never had feelings for him 😭,1
I wish getting a SO was as easy as stabbing them 😔,1
love it because in the game aubrey tried to tell sunny something but kel interrupts, also I just think that it's better than the other aubrey ships and other sunny ships,1
The one thing I dislike about sunburn is femboy sumny, like I'm fine with a soft sunny (with the garbage fire his life has been you can't really blame him) but sunny Has committed murder and stabbed auby before and probably will again in the future just don't make snuuy a femboy,1
because i kin sunny,1
True,45
Oh hey sunny what you do-OMG WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?!,1
Last resort?,76
i kinda wonder if you can call marixhero a ship? Im not sure if they were ever shown to explicitly "date" but they're all lovey-dovey in the photos and flirt in sunny's dreams. Seems like its canon more than anything,89
Lmfao,6
Occam's Razor saves the day ,92
Yeah agreed, the dialogue she says to Sunny is quite suspicious and interesting, whether it has evidence for it idk really, it just seems like a small crush but at the same time we should take point that they are both extremely similar.. . Sunburn does have it's toxic scenarios but I think it's a well thought out ship. There is definitely some platonic stuff going on with them.,70
Sunny is seen fantasizing in the current day Dreamspace of Aubrey having a crush on him so I'd say he still has lingering feeling for her,16
Any ship with hero or Mari in it would be the path of most resistance since they’re already in a relationship together, but shipping them with eachother isn’t a ship it’s just canon. Ships are headcanons.,11
That's just wrong,1
Snuuy :),280
Babey Snuuy,181
,48
Yes.,18
>stabs her. . "Simp",67
Based. I think her inclusion of how she acts in DW is reminiscent a bit to the past RW Aubrey.. . It's a bit weird how he fantasises about someone he hasn't met in 4 years but oh well.,81
You assume that,1
I 100% agree with you and i am kinda mad that there Is not even more evidence than what it's actually there.,76
I wouldnt say its the only one with evidence. Its the only one with concrete evidence.,17
Same here, but at least SunBurn posts, Genderbent Omori posts, and questions related on how to progress the game Completely stops the Basil War posts. And I'm fine with that,166
Based af,9
Chad,6
WHAT DO YOU MEAN THIS GAME IS MADE FOR SHIPPING CHARACTERS IF YOU AREN'T INTO IT THEN YOU'RE NOT REALLY ENJOYING OMORI,1
facts,1
This is too accurate ,6
Pretty accurate, sadly we won't know for sure if it could be close to canon. I just pray for another really good Sunburn fic as I'm dying for one lol.. . Jokes aside I like it and respect it enough. Also Auby gaming ,23
snuuy gamer,1
The difference is though that sunny unlike her staged mari's death as suicide making her think she killed herself ,1
She would probably still be very very very  angry though,1
I guess thats fair but at the same time they all kinda need each other to heal. I mean running away from Basil only made things worse. And sunny hiding from his friends all that time made everything worse as well. So i actually think making these bonds kinda helps them,13
Based,2
I also see an oversaturation of posts about Basil or art without a source, which both are tiring.,38
Yeah gotta agree, I'm always gotta a preference (simply a Sunburn shipper) but it can get annoying, now I don't hate or love it constantly but I feel like we could have way more posts on other ships. Like Sunflower or Suntan or Kimbrey for example.. . I think it's not really about the ship but what makes the ship work and such.,56
[removed],16
Oorrr maybe people just like it and you shouldn't police what ships people post about? Lmfao,-5
Lol sunburn,1
It's funny really, I could just imagine because he's so small she'd be a bit overprotective and defend him due to her bond. It's truly wholesome,5
>not a fan of "rebel/delinquent" archetypes.. . Based, too much media focuses on quirky deliquent characters like they're pleasant people or have any impact on the world when they don't.. . But I don't dislike Aubrey personally because being a hooligan isn't her entire character and I assume that after the gang reunites she snaps out of it.,13
I think it was used pretty well but I understand that it's not for everyone,4
Okay I just laughed at this and imagined Aubrey beating the hell out of Sunny.. . *my mind is twisted, i cant help it*,11
im with you on the no chemistry front. theyre just.. so uninteresting to me, lol. they dont really interact, and when they do its kind of underwhelming. i feel like aubrey and kel have way more chemistry but i never see anyone shipping them !,6
You assume it wasn't mutual,1
How?,1
I think what your missing is quite simple, Aubrey had been abandoned for so long she grew apathetic but compassionate of her friends, she has every right to act the way she does, when she sees Sunny she is startled, she hadn't seen him in 4 years and can gather she missed him as per the Swing Sequence where she apologises and says "Sometimes I feel like i should of been the one there for you" She feels bad for leaving him being malnourished and all for so long, she even contemplates about the past and how she can try to get over Mari with enough time.. . DW Aubrey is different because it's based on Sunny as a kid, not her now. I think that's important to note. RW Aubrey has changed but she's still the same kind, sweet girl she was always in the past. Just... she's altered due to her new appearance and friends.,18
All portrayals in the dreamworld or based on their real old selfs i don't get why people keep trying to avoid that is it because they weirdly ship him with kel,1
I respect that, it can and cannot be considered Canon and people need to remember it's up to interpretation.. . I understand your view point and has its flaws, I just like it and I enjoy the content and ever growing lore to why they're friends. There's alot of sunburn content and it's mostly good but sometimes breaks the characters,5
>I just don't like Aubrey. . ,44
Yo dude, the based department is calling you rn,24
Why? I don't see a reason to dislike her. (People downvoting without giving an actual reason, never change Reddit),4
Yeah I like the dynamic between each member with Sunny as they are all different.. . I personally think the relation with Sunny and Aubrey is special and fits very well with how they cope with pain. The ever growing feeling they have is welcomed, as such I'm a Sunburn shipper but sometimes I take regrets because the fandom is so mixed whether if its good or not but I'll stay by my own opinion.. . I like how you expressed how they act around one another. Sunny and Aubrey definitely imo had it the hardest,6
Yea I mean I’m early 20s and me and a friend are both aware we had mutual  romantic feelings for eachother less then 5 years ago, and we arnt looking to date eachother or anything,10
Dismissive,1
my childhood crush and I still have a crush on each other ,1
>	“most popular ship cause it’s the only straight one”. . Hero/mari isn’t straight?,4
It's definitely overrated and with problems but it's just as respected as the other ships but with the problem of "yeah those guys did bad stuff and are hella toxic together" while it is the case it's up to interpretation,7
Yeah especially on reddit. Like i know with Helluva Boss. The main ship and relationship is gay yet the straight character and relationship is almost more loved on the reddit.. Whereas id guess that Sunflower is more popular on twitter (as it should be 😤),7
Huh? The ship is good because it's good not because it's straight what,1
Its absolutely not semi canon,1
This is all respectable, I feel your pain, but I will not agree nor disagree. Gday <3,3
Hello, based department?t5\31hpy:2468,5
But he dreamed about it for four years tho?,7
She changed yes but she's still the same, can't blame her for even wanting to move past everything, she still cares alot about her friends, or she wouldn't spend the last day going with her friends, reviving her friendship and connect back to Sunny, it would be a waste and she definitely feels bad, she even apologised to how she acts in 3 and 2 days left.. . I think she really is the same girl from 4 years ago, she's been troubled, hurt and heartbroken, ofc she has every reason even though they are bad to act the way she does and her connecting bond to Sunny is proof she's broken inside.,4
You missed the entire point of Aubrey then, she's the same kid who hides behind a facade of anger, Sunny breaks her shell in literally 3 days.,3
She blushed when she wanted to talk to sunny alone for exchanging contact info she needed to do it alone,1
*PTSD to literally every time we find out Sunny and Aubrey were hanging out by themselves due to their evergrowing friendship and bond*,0
Sunbrey would have more to work out than Sunflower?,1
I can see Sunburn becoming real, if they would spend enough time together, but I feel like that this ship wouldn't work. Aubrey is very stubborn and doesn't explain herself well at all, which would be for Sunny too difficult to understand her and said stubbornness could lead to control and a lot of pressure to Sunny and we don't need to discuss how terrible such a thing is for him. Likewise he is too distant for her, she is better of with Kel, whom she mutually doesn't dread at all, this is the best aspect of their relationship. But back to Sunburn, yeah Aubrey is a bit too aggressive for Sunny and that comes from someone who likes the cute and quite boy and the strong and cool girl romance (Shikimori is a better version of sunburn and I love this anime). Yeah the lack of criticism towards Aubrey's behavior and the obvious ill-intent and astonishing lack of compassion she has is often ignored and she is overly sympathized by many, even by a therapist, who should have known better but then again, the same therapist saw no problem with Sweetheart's narcissistic self-marriage. . . I believe that Sunny accepted that he and Aubrey won't work, which is why he never even reciprocated it in his dreams and though they might have feelings for one another, it never amounted to much. Even if that ship is real, it would not be his most significant relationship, since he had always been more fond of Mari and Basil(for whom he risked his life twice). . . Personally Sunflower is the way to go and one of the illustrators is a supporter of this ship and Omocat knew that this ship would come, so they might have made the ship with romantic intentions in mind.,3
Can people stop assuming shipping is about sex please ? 😔,12
Who’s posting sex on this subreddit? . . Shipping isn’t just sex my guy.,10
I'm not even into sex myself so I agree,9
I'm definitely not a shitter when it comes to the other ships, I think I have my own personal preferences as I'm a Sunburn shipper.. . And yeah you're so right, no 2 ship is alike and they should all be treated kindly per se, Basil DEFINITELY has alot of feelings, his way of escapism, hopeless, abandonment, clinginess, etc. It's pretty big evidence.. . I just like Sunburn because it works for me and it's just way too cute to give up on, needless to say you are correct Basil has feelings for Sunny, I think it's the toxic side of the guilt that lends people the wrong way and what happens, even Sunny moving away he'd probably be a bit awkward around Basil too if you know what I mean.. . I think Cactiflower is okay but I don't have an opinion on it yet. So yeah I'll enjoy Sunburn as much as anyone but I'm not gonna simp on it 24/7 like some folks. I enjoyed reading your response,3
There is absolutely zero implications that kel has feelings for sunny the game even outside of the dream world heavily implies Aubrey liked sunny i feel like people avoid it and ignore it to headcanon that kel is the implication which is pretty weird ,1
You're not wrong but the game makes it incredibly vague as to if it actually would happen, as most things it's up to interpretation for it to exist or not.. . I respect that you don't care for it, not everyone will enjoy or like it, as most for other ships. They have mutual bond or some connection but as you said they may not be attracted to eachother anymore.,5
The game clearly implied it's mutual ,1
Tbf she did have a spiked bat that was even said to be stronger than a steak knife,1
Hero was the one seemingly implied to be dating mari I feel like he's worse,1
Clearly not 1 sided,1
Yeah i mean Aubrey beats us up and we stab her so i cant imagine it being still a thing,2
Forced dismissing ,1
Yeah it's not for everyone, the ship is incredibly dynamic overall though. Only problem will be is how others to react to this ship since it creates alot of controversy due to her past actions.,2
Yeah while it's not my interpretation this would happen I can actually see why it WOULD happen, since yknow. Mari was like her sister and Sunny was entrusted by Aubrey as someone she could look up to, it'd definitely would hurt their friendship and she'd probably be extremely mad, but who knows,4
She never hated him what,1
unless he buys more pepper spray.,6
She literally only became friends with her after her other friend "abandoned" her not to say she isn't close but I don't think she's closer,1
You're absolutely right, there is proof. I'm not unbiased to Sunburn obviously since I still think it is with it's big flaws but it's a personal choice to me.. . Kimbrey is a lovely ship I'd say, they both know eachother really well, they hang alot (even before Sunny comes back) and they seem to trust with every problem they have (this is more of a headcanon). And you're right about the stabbing and the fights, while I don't wanna believe it you got some good evidence. So I'll take your opinion lightly and I can respect it as you did your research for the game.. . I do have a few other ships I enjoy like Sunflower, depending on the scenario of how the ship works, even Suntan is awesome although I have literally no choice to follow it as it's not in my favour and then you'd have Cactiflower, something I'm looking into.,0
Did you play the game?,1
Sunflower ,1
Based. ,4
why do you see her as a lesbian (genuine curiosity). i never really saw it tbh,6
This is very true, I respect this, whatever comes to your mind is fine by me, not all ships will be likes and some aren't likely to exist as interpretations exist.. . I respect that you like the image of healing,1
Its literally not one sided he didn't project it as all of the inner selfs aren't fake versions they are literally just them but prior to mari's death I feel like people keep forgetting this,1
I also ship it, it's not confirmed canon tho, its just hinted that auby likes snuuy and we have no idea whether he likes her back >!(im talking abt RW)!<,7
It's not, Sunny had a crush when they was young (not Aubrey) and now even if Aubrey looks more nice with Sunny then other, they're not in romantic relationship,14
i think it's important to remember almost everything in the DW is this idealistic world sunny created for himself. he seemed to have had a small crush on aubrey when they were younger so he made her like him back. It would make sense for him to want a love interest of sorts.. . But in the real world, we don't really see any indication she liked him back, and present day she's seen him for the first time in 4 whole years. She has changed so so much and she sees him for 3 days suddenly. . . Just doesn't seem canon to me. Hinted at sure. But even then her liking him back isn't really a thing,4
That's Sunny's head tho, he's the one imagining killing Basil.,5
Yeah. I do still love her after that but what she did to Basil i think is hard to defend,2
Do you love it or hate it because of that lol,1
I always say that all ships are understandable and valid but there's always that one ship you'll like more, whether it's unhealthy or not.. . And yeah more power to them, I think it's not about if it works or not but how it makes the reader/viewer feel personally,3
[deleted],2
[deleted],1
Wtf is gay about a fist bump lmao,2
Or the fact she was trying to beat him up,1
Why wouldn’t Sunny try and stay in touch with Aubrey? I haven’t an extremely hard time believing that he’d let their friendship just end after spending three days rebuilding it,1
are you saying you like that or that you dislike that?,1
well it's a ship isn't it,259
Isn't the last resort a ship?,16
R/Wooosh,2
i think you can still ship canon personally, idk if it goes against the definition or smthm but like 🤷,47
ship just stands for relationship so it can be platonic, romantic, fanmade or canon,24
Canon ships are still ships,10
Actually with Hero >!that technically wouldn't be an issue due to Mari being dead. However, due to him still grieving after 4 years it's unlikely he would pursue any form of relationship anytime soon!<,22
Sunneye*,74
Bonus point if the whole group teases them both and Aubrey gets all  while Sunny just blushes madly with a poker face,184
,20
Nervous reaction,48
,15
He hasn't aged properly in 4 years I don't think concept of time exists for him,113
It's also that. My HC is that her turbulent life is a result of desperation given her life crumbled around her post-Mari, and deep down she's still like she was 4 years ago, and in my (ongoing forever because life reasons) fic that's exactly what is explored. Everyone coming clear about everything, doing it right, and being there for each other...but with some twists. . . Although should be said that in this one Mari is put in one of those very long comas instead of dying, and will eventually wake up. I dunno when, honestly, i have enough to deal with IRL and would need to get in touch with the material again, but she will. And thus the despair of our favourite group of friends finally ends...with some caveats.,42
,62
Real,2
Careful, we do not speak of the watermelon boy, no need for the war to repeat hehe. /srs.. . I'm fine with ship posts but like my opinions on why I dislike/like all of them comes with disagreements on this sub, most positive but some negative. I don't mind ships but some just aren't to my favour.,59
Oh yeah, definitely in the beginning,3
Well, in the end they both would probably make that choice about the nature of their relationship, but let them be more stable first. Sticking together as (best) friends is also a strong bond too.,4
[removed],10
I've barely seen any Sunflower lately tbh. Maybe 1-2 fanarts.,15
I think it deoends where you go. Cause Reddit i think has more Sunburn but i think twitter has more Sunflower,3
I don't know, Sunburn has been out of hand recently (I have posted a couple in the last 2 weeks but not much, it's just a preference really) but Sunflower is both underrated and way overlooked due to how both of Sunny and Basil share their bond.,5
What part of "imo" which directly means "***in my opinion***" did you not understand?,9
It's subjectivity, it's okay to post about this but they're stating that it gets out of control and it's their own opinion. Nothing factual just straight up opinionated,2
That's fine too! Personally I couldn't get over her actions towards her old friends, but to each their own of course:),4
No full stop. Aubrey has no right whatseoever to react the way she did in the game. And again im with the original commentor. I think that swing scene is very platonic. I doubt shed be confessing feelings like that the day after she bullied us and nearly killed Basil,14
I'll say it's based but personally I just think Aubrey is a well written and lovely character *^(yes i know she bullied basil but that aside she's really unique)*,16
There's a reason to dislike every one of the characters. They all have flaws. Even hero and mari. Turns out they're human and do shitty things just as much as they do good things. This sub is kinda weird for saying "bazil is trash" and in the same breath will say "omg sunny is so precious" when the dude >!literally kills his fucking sister!<.,21
I like her, but I can more than understand why people would hate her. Some people just hate bullies, which I get.,2
I was basing it off the fact that I had a crush on a girl for four years and realized it was just friendly attraction ,3
I meant the only straight one with the main character (Sunny x mari does not exist sunny x mari does not exist),1
Yeah I do prefer the Omori shipping scene on Twitter,2
Because everyone wants to be loved, and since he had a crush on her, Omori made Aubrey in love with him (I think she was the only girl he knew),2
I do agree with you on everything you said.. . I think I should clarify with what I meant by she’s changed. In Sunny’s mind he has a very particular view of Aubrey while the current Aubrey has grown up. She didn’t hide away from everything like him. . . The Aubrey that Sunny new as a kid doesn’t exist anymore. She’s experienced hardships, done things she’s regret (and is atoning and apologized for) and has a whole new friend group. . . She’s still the same person who loves her friends I just think she grew up and changed while Sunny didn’t.,11
Exactly, I believe it was Sunny who kinda helped her ease all of the abandonment she suffered. She is the same after 4 years, just her delinquent personality changed alot of her, even the photo of her and Kim is a good example, she's the same but altered.. . I really wish people notice how much Aubrey cared about people, not to mention because of her personality in RW she must've been bullied in a way for her appearance to so Sunny uncoincidentally helped her come to terms with her faults,2
"Sunny breaks her shell in literally 3 days". . No, that was Hero. He's the one who made Aubrey see the error of her ways and reconcile with the others. If it wasn't for him, Aubrey would still be sulking in her room and resenting her old friends.,5
that doesn't mean she's romantically interested in him though. doesn't even mean sunny is romantically interested in her too lol. sunny had a crush on her when they were 12 before >!the incident!< but that doesn't really mean he still has a crush on her after 4 years of not talking to her, and >!killing her best friend!< doesn't help either,15
the reason why i don't think Sunflower would have as much to work out in a post-hospital scenario is because they... sorta have a head start. memory lane + secret ending strongly imply both of them forgave eachother for both the truth and the events of the final day.. . yeah sure they do need to work through their trauma and come to terms with forgiving \*themselves\*, but i don't think there's a lot of possibility of there being bad blood between them, which is the key to my argument.. . &#x200B;. . i think that it's pretty strongly likely that Aubrey takes a \*really\* long time to forgive Sunny for his actions. considering how she reacted to the blacked out photos, i'm hard-pressed to believe this would be an even remotely reasonable affair. even with the obvious facts of her nearly killing someone in the same way, i doubt she'd come to that realization for a while without a lot of help. but it can happen!,2
ok.,1
I know that.,0
In the two years since writing this comment I became a Kelbrey shipper. Do with that what you will,1
Yeah i was prety sure that was the case, im glad i wasnt wrong there or else my whole comment would sound really stupid lol.. . sorry if i came off as disrespectful, either way, though, and yeah. With omoris open ending, anything could happen, really :p. I mean some things are kinda absurd, like sonic falling from the sky and causing a nuclear explosion but you get what i mean.,2
im willing to believe that 🫡 i dont remember even making this comment lol,1
A second knife,2
Yeah and i dont even really ship Kimbrey that much but its obvious thats Aubreys now. I mean Kim knew where Aubrey was, when i dont think anyone else knew, Kim was super worried for her when she didnt come out. . . Another thing i dont like about it is that Mari was very sisterly/motherly to Aubrey and to me then shipping Aubrey with Maris brother feels weird. But there is evidence and it is a cute ship. . . And yeah ill see the occasional Suntan and the rare Cactiflower and i like them just fine,1
It’s ok but after therapy. Sunny still could do better,1
not the same person but she shows no interest in guys and i refuse to call her relationship with kim purely platonic,7
This was a two-year-old comment, so I’m not really sure how it even got replied to in the first place, but the headspace characters are, quite literally, figments of Sunny’s imagination. They do not exist in the real world, outside of brief hallucinations, and are therefore not the same as the actual people they’re based on. They are not “literally just them but prior to Mari’s death;” they may be similar to their younger real-world counterparts, but they are ultimately Sunny’s idealized, fictionalized versions of his friends that he has built up in his head as a coping mechanism.,1
My bad, I meant what happened in the real world not in headspace,4
op asked for everything,1
I'm just saying they look like really good friends. Roommates, if you will.,1
If Sunny leaves town without telling the truth, he's most likely  to go back to isolating himself because of the guilt. If he didn't try communicating with his friends when he was in town, why would he try when he's elsewhere? Yes, he had 3 days to rekindle friendships, but in this end, nothings resolved and nothing has changed.. . If Sunny does tell the truth, then I think it would be Aubrey who wouldn't want to talk to him. >!If she can hold a grudge against Sunny for not being there for her after Mari died, then I can't imagine she'd be Hero levels of sympathetic towards him or Basil after she learns the truth.!< Yes she did say to keep in touch, but that was before she found out the truth. Her mind could have changed at that moment.. . Of course, this is just my opinion and I am someone who doesn't think a happy ending where everyone is best friends again is possible,1
I dislike that, sorry forgot to specify,1
Not a very good one, it's at the bottom of the sea...,124

ok ig but it'd be kinda weird to call you and your partner a ship yk? like ship implies an unproven yet theorised relationship based on most usage. idk the definition exactly tho so sure,1
>!OneEye!<,110
I mean it's obvious they blushed alot as kids, they had a favourite spot at the swings too :),117
Yeah Aubrey was always the same I believe, she just became delinquent after being abandoned for 4 years. She tried her hardest to stay in touch but so much changed.,26
         You have a point there, .     .          unfortunately I am blind . . (As I said, I don't really care about ships. As long as they're stopping possible 'tragedy' and they look amazing with good enough effort put into it, they're fine),32
And i can agree to that. I mean Sunny is moving so they do have time to all like get better and accept and forgive.,3
Blessed,10
You should hop on Twitter (only for the fanarts, ignore everything else). You'd have to scroll through at least seven different Sunflower artworks before finding a glimpse of Sunburn.,7

Ok? It's still dumb to want to change it, masking it under the guise of it being your opinion doesn't mean they're free from criticism.,-3
True she may of bullied Basil but Sunny was the one who marked the photos so she assumed it was Basil. It's both a bad and understandable move since they're best friends.. . Although I see your point,3
Yes, unique is a way of describing her,9
>!Sunny was traumatized almost beyond repair and youre gonna insult him for it💀!<,11
Well that's true, she has flaws and did shitty things... But she actually apologized and feels remorse for her actions, she still cares about her friends and wants to do better to correct her flaws/mistakes. I can't possibly dislike that. (Disagreed about the sub, that's generalazing too much),8
Personally I like each character and they have both flaws, motives and insecurities, they have all suffered and Sunny and Basil are the cause but they do still suffer sadly.. . I think yes you can dislike them and I won't discredit that but to me they are pretty hard to hate/dislike due to how well written OMORI is.,1
fair enough, brother ,3
I’d just say it’s because sunny/aubrey is the one most supported by the game. I’ve seen other ones like sunny/cris and sunny/mincy before.,1
Yeah ro me Sunflowe is the cuter ship and to me the one that works rhe best and has the most evidence for. But im fine with most ships,1
Ah I see now, I just wanted to add on with my defense.. . I think you are right about everything, I must've looked at your comment the wrong way.,3
I... Didn't mean that,0
Fair enough,1
That's way more understandable it's weird and a bit gross hearing that people ship him with sunny even worse that it is or apparently was the most popular given it's zero evidence as i said i feel like people forcibly dissuade and shoo off the fact that dream world counterparts are based on their real life selves at that time to force the ships they prefer over it.,1
There's the parallels between reality and dreamworld as well as memory lane and the scene of the two i don't really mind if you prefer a different ship i was just annoyed at peoples dismissal of the endgame implications,1
I think what rubs me the wrong way when it comes to the Kimbrey ship is how inadvertently Aubrey turned the hooligans into punk-like buffoons. I wish it didn't happen and there were ways around it.. . And yeah it could seem a bit odd that Aubrey WOULD date Sunny since she saw Mari is a mother/sister figure. But yeah there's still evidence to it despite the circumstances.,1
She doesn't show any interest in girls either though ,2
Real.,2
Just because they don't exist doesn't mean they aren't based on the real versions mate they are just themselves we literally see that proven in the photos why are you coping on it so hard the literal entire point is sunny/omori wanting to go back to how things were before mari death meaning they literally are just themselves before mari death they say this so many times in the story how did you miss it?,0
>!Her entire character development is overcoming that grudge. Can't imagine she'd hold another one for very long after that. Plus she can understand better than anyone how easy it can be to act out of anger, she almost killed basil by drowning him at the lake. I do think she would forgive him after all that, even if it wasn't right away. Everyone forgiving Sunny and being best friends again may not be the most realistic, but I don't think we should focus on what's realistic necessarily. The game spends 20 hours showing you how strong their friendship is despite what happened and how everyone still cares for sunny, and a primary theme is how doing a bad thing doesn't make you a bad person!<,2

And I respect your opinions ,1
I didn't say that people need to stop posting Sunburn, I only said that posts ***SHOULD***, but don't have to be a bit more diverse.  . Also being unnecessarily mean towards my opinion ≠ criticism.,10
Yeah but still it's this dudes opinion and you should respect that,3
Again i get that she saw the marked photos and got upset which is fine. But bullying the low self esteem loner kid with all tour friends isnt what id call fair. And yeah especially since it seems like Aubrey and Basil were also very close.,9
As much as I defend the Snuuy it's still a valid choice to dislike him for killing his sister,3
Oh don't get me wrong, I don't hate all the characters. In fact I think they're all great and well written, and tbh I'd probably be friends with them irl if given the opportunity. I just think this sub can be a bit weird when talking about characters and why they're bad or good. Seems pretty black and white for some while ignoring key traits of certain characters.,9
i mean they definitely aren't BAD bad. And as characters they're well written. but theres plenty of reason to think "i dont agree with how they handled this and dont like them very much". Personally i UNDERSTAND why aubrey turned out how she did, but i kinda resent bullies and those real world segments really made me hate aubrey (although i sorta changed my mind later on of course),5
🤝,3
I do sorta agree, I do think Sunburn deserves to be one of the most popular ships. but i just think it’s a bit TOO popular,1
I didn’t explain myself very well in my first comment so it’s all good!,1
what did you mean,4
thats fair lol,, i was kinda insufferable mentioning suntan when the discussion wasnt about them 🫡 i imagine id get annoyed in your shoes as well,1
I’m not “coping on it so hard.” They are LITERALLY figments of Sunny’s imagination, and portray what he wants his friends to be rather than what they actually are. I am going off of the actual canon of the story. Who they’re based on ultimately doesn’t matter, because being based on someone is not the same as actually being that person. They are not capable of thoughts, feelings, and actions besides that which Sunny projects onto them, and that is made abundantly clear throughout the story as his psyche becomes more and more warped and it becomes more apparent that his friends in headspace are his coping mechanisms. They are not real people, and they cannot be judged or evaluated as such. The only actual, reliable characterization we have of the friend group prior to Mari’s death is what we see in the photos, and even then it’s only a superficial perspective.,1

I've seen a couple fics do this but it's nothing special, although I like the banter they have obviously Kim is a lot more easy going than she appears to be because of how the Hooligans were changed during the time with Aubrey and then Basil with his love of gardening isn't Kim's strong suit so she'd tease him for sure.. . It's both incredibly realistic for her character and a way to show that she's not just some bully.,8
Dude that means the exact same thing what point are you even trying to make here. . . I told you to respect what ships people like and not police them how is that mean? Even if I worded it mean it's still relevant criticism.,1
Is it? It's never fair or valid to fault someone for a genuine accident, if you ask me.,4
Mate i literally just explained to you the literal plot reason of why they fucking exist they are exactly how they were prior to mari's death and we literally see a flash back of the real life them seeing the act exactly the same I don't get how this is so hard for you to wrap your head around sunny wants to pretend mari's death didn't happen so he imagines them exactly how they were prior to mari's death there for no they aren't warped or idealized they are literally just them before mari passed and 4 years prior he knows them what they'd say how they'd act etc and hell we literally see this proven in the real world present how they still clearly have personality traits from that long ago hell hero literally says the exact same thing as his dream world version when helping kel and Aubrey and kel and Aubrey act the exact same as well in response mate this is how it was made on purpose the entire point and plot revolve around sunny's rejection of time passing after he killed mari it is sunny backtracking and pretending it never happened there for they all remain unchanged and act as they were prior to mari's death where the hell did you get the idea they were fake versions from,1
I LOVE TOYOTA COROLLAS ,2
im just rlly dumb,2
>Dude that means the exact same thing. . It quite literally doesn't.  . People use "need" when something is *required*.  . Examples:  . I need a new pair of shoes.  . We need to hire a mechanic.  . . . People use "should" for advice or opinions.  . Examples:  . You should interfere.  . You should do it somewhere else.. . Now sure, these can be used interchangeably, but only sometimes. Usually "need" is used for higher levels of necessity than "should".  . . . >I told you to respect what ships people like. . Who the fuck said that I don't respect them? Your words have much less respect towards ships than mine, considering that you apparently want this sub to be dominated by one single ship. People don't like only one ship and not everyone here is a fan of Sunburn, you know. I pointed out that it would be nice if some other ships could be posted here other than Sunburn, but it's not required and it's still up to those who actually post fanart on this subreddit.,3
I think it depends on your pov. You can make the argument it was accident but what's done is done and unfortunately alot transpired during that time.. . Like I said I like Sunny and he's an amazing character but there was so much wrong with his choices during the 4 years,1
I got the “idea” that they were fake versions from the literal canon. They do not exist in that form anymore, and have not since prior to Mari’s death. Thus, any decision they make is not their own. This is easily understood with basic reading comprehension and literacy skills. Someone’s memories of a person are not the same thing as that person; they are a very filtered view of what that person chooses to present to the world and, in the case of the Headspace characters, are subject to inaccuracy thanks to their role as Sunny’s coping mechanism. This is one of the primary themes of the game. Also, please learn how to use punctuation. That run-on-sentence is a headache in visual form.,1
?,1
You literally proved my point.. "anymore" meaning that is what they were which is the point and go you're grasping at straws trying to say it was "filtered" no they weren't it was literally just them as the game proves literally in the older versions of themselves and no funny you mention reading comprehension as you completely missed what it meant by coping mechanism.. the point is sunny refuses to acknowledge mari's death as he choses to not acknowledge all his trauma therefor he imagines a unchanging world literally just a world that didn't change also to mention once again all dreamworld versions literally carry on into the real world in the dream world mari liked hero and hero liked mari and the real world it's heavily implied they had feelings for each other which you seem to purposely ignore or just somehow missed for mpre proof on the many just as he did with basil when he died basil's bathroom door simply dissappeared that was his coping mechanism not reimagining basil which funny as he's never done that with any of them his coping mechanism was forgetting and pretending it didn't happen also funny you mention when they beat up basil that wasn't to show they were only his coping mechanism that was him imagining what they'd do to him should he tell them the truth which was the only imagined thing,0
You’re completely missing my point. My point is that no memory that a person has of someone else is ever going to be the same thing as that person. Sunny has memories of his friends as he remembered them — he cannot possibly know or emulate their exact thoughts and emotional processes and, thus, his Headspace friends are inaccurate and idealized portrayals of what he wants to remember, rather than an accurate portrayal of who his friends really were. You have clearly missed a lot of the game’s blatant messaging, and are also quite clearly too belligerent to understand that right now. I’m not going to waste any more of my time arguing with the sort of person who replies to two-year-old comments with incorrect logic, evidently can’t comprehend one of the main themes of the game (the inherent fallacy of the human mind), and can’t even bother to formulate a grammatically correct sentence. Have a nice day.,1
And that's just wrong in the story as I've literally fucking proven you can keep trying to find real life excuses for your denial but in this game the only idealization is that they never witness and had to go through mari's death proven and reiterated in. the. fucking. Game. You can stroke your dick to your ego as much as you want you missed the point of the game and you're indenial about that fact even though the game as I've said shows every god damn time that the real life versions parallel the versions in the dreamland because your so stubbornly wrong that they are merely idealized even though that makes no sense for the context of the story and completely disgrards the plethora of evidence to the contrary as well as the point of the dreamworld to begin with because if I had to guess to fucking speedran the game that's the only way you could miss the dart board this hard,0

I actually think it was more Sunny closing himself off from her that affected her more than Mari's death.

Eh, everyone has their own boundaries in humor. I personally think that serious topics can raise more awareness by making jokes and therefore breaking the taboo of talking about it. . That's why I like dark humor and satire, because it does just that if it's done well. You also have to look at the intention behind a joke. In this case, it wasn't "haha racism is funny", it was "Kel wanted to paint Omori purple because he doesn't look like the others. Racism is bad." And that's a very important difference. Joking about something doesn't mean you like the thing you're joking about, it can often mean the opposite.,30
Bro you are on fucking reddit,41
It’s not like it was an edgy joke calling out a specific race, if you’re not able to simply joke about a topic like that then I don’t see how you can seriously discuss it with others in the real world,13

Got it chief, It’s all been resolved already, I’ll take your advice though,12
Also I'm not saying that there's no need for you to feel offended, I'm just saying that you need to know when's the right moment for you to show your thoughts on something that upsets you, or a downvote rush might be waiting for you (almost always with a good reason).,7

I feel like Basil would either cry or channel all of that naive chaotic energy of his and answer the question,315
"Kel what the fuck you made Basil cry" - Sunny, Aubrey and Hero,166
Why'd you have to make Basil cry?? That's a punishable offense!,253
The artist is [@machiiattoo]() on insta,40
Why You make Basil cry,42
Every Kel meme is canon,58
omori,21
kel apologize right now 😃🔪,17
Hilarious but can we appreciate the art style? It's soooooo perfect for this meme! Basil crying had me crying laughing on the floor hahahah.,14

Kel, this jury has found you guilty of making Basil cry in the first degree. You are sentenced to one bonk!,148

I hate that this made me laugh,14
I think it's a worthy punishment for making Basil cry with a 'Deez nuts' joke.,59
Cruel? That's lenient as hell! The minimum amount of bonks that can be given for such a heinous crime is 30!,36
I’m the worst aren’t I,20
We’ll give him 1000! And... what’s this? It says to... >!”give basil one killer bonk”? Who wrote this? WAIT OMORI NO-!<,29
30 monks? What would Kel even do with that many monks? That's 6 whole basketball teams.,9

probably had a sleepover at one point before the incident? But this can be taken way out of context lmao,1168
Its not that weird guys, sunny ranks every single bed in the game. Basil just has a superior bed taste,829
Ah yes, Sunny, bed inspector, inspector of all beds. . . With all that time he was sleeping he should be able to point out a quality mattress.,324
[deleted],182
You never visited your friend's house?,137
that completely straight moment when you're at a sleepover and instead of sleeping on the couch or floor you sleep in your homie's bed with him,338
: Yo Basil what if we shared a bed together . . :,80
,207
You ever had a sleepover dude?,119
I also find my best friend’s bed comfortable,30
Not true because he described Hero’s bed as perfect. I do like the bed-rater game though,26
Sleepover, presumably,24
Pretty sure he rates beds based on his friendship with whoever the owner of the bed is. In this case, Sunny and Basil are best friends, so naturally he finds Basil's bed the most comfortable.,42
Gay,49
To be fair I think it's more sus that if you interact with Aubrey's bed, you just get the text, "Aubrey's bed...",32
When your parents can afford a nice comfy mattress but can’t afford to be with you for your childhood,23
He says the hospital is comfortable I think,9
Did you guys never try your friends beds when you went over 😵😵,9
Idk if anyone's said this but maybe it implies Basil has his own version of headspace?,17
It’s a sleepover...,7
This is incorrect, (maybe) they also found Sweetheart's bed comfy,5
📸,6
 I just think it's comfortable okay? Nothing else.,6
They probably just had a sleepover? Like the oldest Sunny could have been is 12, so I'd hope it's not a romantic thing.. . I ship them but not like that...,5
sleepover at basils house because he's the type of guy to say "I can sleep on the floor it's ok",3

fellas, is it gay to find your best friend's bed comfortable?,3
Fr though anyone has a theory for the symbolism behind this?,5
Sunburnflower,6
oh god my dirty mind,5
BASIL’s and not MARI’s?,2
because he is one of the few people who gave up sleeping on rocks,2
My theory is that the gang had a sleepover at Basil's house but Sunny doesn't like to sleep in the bag, so Basil had to give him his bed. Sunny probably did that whenever they had a sleepover at someone's house,2
When interacting with Basil’s bed a text box appears and says “A very comfortable looking bed” If you interact with anyone else’s bed Sunny will give it a rating and text will say why he rates it that way. The website the photo was taken on is the Omori wiki, Just google “Omori Wiki”,2
Am I the only one who let my friends use my bed whenever they slept over?,2
I think he just tests every bed he comes in contact with,2
,2
Sunny deserves the Bed Inspector role,2
they cuddle on da bed yk,2
He did that minecraft thing where you can break into a villager's house, throw them out of their own bed and then sleep on it.,2
Click the citation.,2
He layed out on it?,2
He could have just pushed down on the mattress with his hand or sit on it when he interacted with Basils bed????,2
Sunny and basil use the same kind of mattress so it makes sense,2
sl. sleepover?. . but he hasn't met basil's parents or caretaker...,4

Once again i think people are just making stuff up in the comments. This whole sleepover notion is WILD to me. Yes they couldve had a sleepover but who tf ever sleot on the bed? I always slept either on a couch or the floor, never once on the be,1
Who has the other bed he considers comfortable? Mari?,1
Y’all it’s probably just a sleepover.. . I will not allow unnecessary gay shipping propaganda today lol,-1

Where is this from?,1
Basil gets bitches and the male equivalent of bitches,1
,1
They probably sat on the bed and made flower crowns or something, whenever I had a play date I’d invite my friends to sit on the bed while we played games,1
when I have a sleepover with my BFF in his house he would always offer me his bed and gets a mattress and sleeps next to me. not that we are gay because we aren't( we are both straight) but come on. don't yall like to talk with your BFF all night before finally sleeping at 4am or 5am?,1
Is sunny a type of bed critic or….  ,1

Does that mean he has been there before,1
[deleted],549
Yeah but i never slept in the bed. Not to mention we see a sleepover with Sunny, Kel, and Hero and theyre both on the floor,20
nahh bruh lmfao,18
quirky indie game with a professional bed inspector mc,485

The most likely explanation,47
People headcanon that when he gets older Sunny will get a job as a musician or game designer or something similar but the real based take is that he will get a job selling the softest, fluffiest mattresses known to man,10

it’s only gay if you don’t wear socks,89
I think this is pretty normal, my friends and I shared beds all the time at sleepovers,20
Yeah?,2
Gay,155
I always sleep on the floor. ,110
Are you implying Sunny never had a sleep over with Kel, or that it's only when he has sleepovers with basil does he share a bed?,12
In most sleepovers I've been to you don't share the bed.... . Although tbh Basil's the kind of kid to offer his bed and sleep on the floor himself.,5
I mean neither Kel, Heros or Aubreys is. Like i think theres symbolism there and i think its crazy to think that this was added as, "Oh they just had a sleepover". Also who tf ever slept in the bed at a sleepover? I always slept on the floor or something,4
Everyone's bed is uncomfortable but his and Basil's,7
reminds of the tea theory from deltarune,2
Yeah ,21
Or European?,8
I don't think it's a coincidence that HS Aubrey starts flirting with Omori a ton right after Sunny sees Aubrey for the first time in four years.,8
I remember hero saying we have never been in aubreys house,2

Sunny also says the blankets on the floor/bed in Basil's living room looks comfy, so I think he might just feel safer in Basil's house since they were best friends? Idk,4

THEYRE CHILDREN,14
Pretty sure sunny’s bed used to be mari’s,9
I love your pfp,1
His grandma took care of him before she became to ill and Polly came,10
They havent talked in 4 years meaning that they were 12. Kids. Children. Babies. I have high doubts,11
is it really that weird to share a bed with your best friend at a sleepover? even if ur a guy (im a guy myself) when I was <12 id sleep in the same bed with my friend, I still have friends who are in college (tbf both girls) who sleep in each other's beds regularly. I guess it gets weirder when you're older but I always figured everyone at least tried it once when they were younger and you slept with someone of the opposite gender,5
Bruh, I’m (insert age lol) and I still sleep in my homies’ beds. Granted, I only regularly stay the night at one friend’s house, but still. He and I share the twin and just lay apart from one another. I despised laying on the floor as a little kid, couldn’t sleep, so he said “Oh, just come up here!”,1
I think it was the blankets on the floor in the living room when they were >!sleeping over at Basil's house towards the end of the game!<,1

[removed],3
No, Basil just probably got that expensive high quality mattress lmao. . . Sharing a bed during a sleepover ain't a crazy concept,67
Sunny inspects all beds, Kel and Hero just don't have that superior taste in beds. . In Aubrey's case, her lack of a comfortable bed has a really obvious reason,32
Kel and Hero just got jank beds dude, idk what to tell you. It ain't that deep. . . >Also who tf ever slept in the bed at a sleepover. . .... a lot of people? I've slept with my friends in their beds before, it ain't that weird. I've offered up my bed to friends before, and they've offered there's to me. Just the "hosts treat the guests" mentality I guess,8
Kel and Hero don't have a good taste in beds. . Aubrey's case is kinda obvious,31
Oh really? Nevermind then.,6
I love that this thread is the only one without an argument in it.,11
Basil is British confirmed,3
Yeeeeaaaah,5
d e e p,5
Aware of this. Was just wondering if some lore maniac has a cracked theory about this,3
,2
Exactly what I’m thinking. They were like 12 before the incident, I highly doubt there was ever anything sexual between them.,9
exactly,1
Why?,2
How do you know that? Interesting and sad if true,2
But >!in the sequence at Sunny's house before the Omori boss fight (or was it after? Idk) there were two beds in Sunny's room!<,2
good bot,2
actually just remembered kel saying something like "wow, it's been a while since i've been in here",5
I dont think ita weird i just domt see it as normal. It might just be my own like personal experience but i never slept in a homies bed at a sleep over andni feel like most of the time i also dont hear people sleeping in a bed. I mean weve seen 2 sleepovers in the game and both had no one else in a bed. Idk i could be wrong but i dont see it. Just like the handholding i just dont see it as something that happened or happens unless people are really close,1
Bot en’s “ayo the pizza here” is activating quite a lot for having such a low chance,2
Never! I won’t accept that sunny and Basil are gay!. . *Pulls out lightsaber*,0

A stretch, but since HAL has historically made some pokémon games in the past, you could call the series "MOTHER-inspired".,12
I'm not talking about your bed Basil,35
either 50x more gay or the average amount of gay, it depends on the person,47
Reddit moment,10
: Omori why are you upset? Can I not be a gay mf?,57
,8
So basil be a freak in the streets and a king in the sheets with that good good memory foam orthopedic shiz topped with the finest Egyptian cotton and satin is what you're sayin? . . I can dig that. My dude knows how to nap.,50
Fr like if it was just me and my best friend when we were kids we shared my bed. When it was our whole group (five girls) my parents would lend us their room and we’d sleep in a row on their king and watch movies on their TV. Miss those times man.,7
Sunny actually refers to hero’s bed as ‘Perfect’ if I remember correctly,7
I agree but i think it being the only other bed to be as good as his own is an intentional detail. Whether it be small or actually mean more in terms of their relationship idk but i think its not just, "Oh his bed is just made of better material",2
Thats probably true. But i disagree with you saying its not deep. They spent a faur bit of time creating Sunny as this bed inspector and to have Basil be the only one to be one he likes i think is important. Like just showing hey, Basil is closest to sunny and that just being it but i dont think its just a surface level, like oh its jusy comfy. . . And again, it is just my own personal experience but i had many many sleepovers in my youth and i never slept in a bed. Wed always just stay in like the living room or id sleep on the floor. Im not saying its weird but, just like the handholding, i dont see it as the usual,1
There was a thread that was just meme roleplay,5
[removed],8
[*ahem*](),2
Ayyyyyyyyy,1
i mean. . someone here agrees so there’s probably some truth to it maybe,1
makes sense, ig i kinda meant there was a requirement on how close you were to the person, and it was a fairly rare occurrence. Thats kinda how I can see Sunny and Basil sleeping together in the same bed, especially cuz they were young and it seems like they were super close, I understand that this is definitely not a normal thing for most people ive talked to tho cuz when I do mention it i get called gay lol,2
oh god are y’all starting a fucking duel,3
oh lmao i was trying to say something like that but idk anymore ,58
It's not a competition. . Although everyone knows that BTD5 is far superior, of course. The progression is more interesting when you can only use one building at a time instead of the whole tech tree at once, for instance.,5
Kel is a Btd4 on the DSi type of dude,1
Coincidence?. . i think NOT,22
They ship Kris with WHO NOW? Their friend who looks like their BROTHER?,5

: No.,60

He got a sleep country gift card for christmas,3
Nah bro basil got that sleep country gift card,6
Consider this.... . . Sunny and Basil have the same mattress. Crazy, I know. It's also fair to mention, I don't think he rates Hero, Kels, or Aubreys beds either. He usually just comments on how the bed is made. I just don't think it's meant to be that deep, it's flavour text really.. . . . We know their entire friend group was close, I don't think it's that odd.,9
Are you trying to start an argument in this thread? ,7
This is the sacred thread,2
Actually Sunny has been in Aubreys room before, in the >!hikki route when you rescue basil, Aubreys bed is identical to the one in her irl room.!< plus he knows that Aubreys pet bunny is called bun bun, further cementing this.,10
iirc Sunny's bed used to be Mari's. I also don't think that it has much to do with the bed itself but rather Sunny's connection to whoever owns the bed.,8
i did not want to think about it so cuz i knew they were children,1
Yes. We fight at daybreak.,0
[deleted],43
Yeah kralsei is pretty popular, im surprised you havent heard about it,11
Ehh, not really, he just vaguely looks like a Boss monster, and it seems to be normal to date people of your own species/your family's species considering Asgore and Toriel are a thing so I think Kris was just like "oh cool, he's a Goat too" and not "this femboy bimbo bitch looks like my fucking brother, I can'tdate him now". Considering the game itself seems to be teasing Ralsei having a crush on Kris, unless the honestly bad theory that Ralsei and Asriel are the same person is true, I don't think there's any level of incest involved.,4
it was your presents,3
HoHoHomosexual. . ,59
: Why not?,46
It came from his parents, alongside the letter they sent explaining they wouldn't be able to make it home for Christmas for the 8th year running.,6
I actually cant remember if he says anything for the other 3 but i feel like that further makes Basils stick out. And again it was a conscience decision to make Basils bed the one to stick out and i think its deep. . . But then again i think i just look super deep into every detail cause my outlook on most games are, hey this detail was made with an intention, what can we get out of that detail and i think this is one. I think this game  is full of these really tiny details that at least mean something.,1
. . i’ll show myself out ,1
They read the Lord of the Rings books together in bed and Kel was there to witness it so it's canon,37
Yeah I played the game a few months back, but didn't really get into the fan stuff to do with it. Thanks for informing me,4
Ahh alright, that makes sense ig. Thanks for informing me,1
,1
: Because I said so. >!And also because you killed him numerous times in BS.!<,55
He does, I believe he comments how Heros is perfectly made, just like how he is, and that Kels is messy. Aubreys I think he just says "Aubreys beds...". If the holding hands and sharing a bed are weird, I wonder how you feel about Sunny commenting multiple time how perfect Hero is,6
[deleted],7
the weed felt like a present,1
: Technically you killed him. I just wanted him silenced. Not killed.,53
Yeah but again Basils is the only one where its just comfortable. And its mot even saying its comfortable, it just looks comfortable, which i do think gets rid of the sleepover notion as well. . . Well everyone calls hero perfect. Thats his whole character. Hes the pretty boy whos also basically has ocd.,-2
another flower language enjoyer yeaaahhhhhhhh,2
,1
: You didn't specify.,41
Bro, it's a bed  again, it ain't that deep. You can't really read between the lines with this 💀,5
: Fuck it. Ima get in bed with Basil and you can’t stop me,50
And again i think its an intentional detail, i domt think its got super importance but i do think its important. Like i said, little details are important in this game. Again it might just be my reading way too much i to details but i think small details are important,-4
: Why are you gae?,31
: Basil is hot,37
: Understandable.,35

What the fuck did I just read,5
This thread is a mess and I loved every moment of it,3
peak comedy,5
I have conflicted emotions about this comic considering what happens in the game, but it's very cute regardless,560
Canon art from OMOCAT implies Omori is actually a real entity/spirit that genuinely cares for Sunny. You can sort of tell he’s his own person when you read the item descriptions in headspace, and how he seems to be much less childish and more eloquent with the way he writes than the other characters.,172
This is a very wholesome comic,140
. . . . idk if this is a repost,92
This is adorable!,67
The art is sooo cuuute ^^,43
Awwww,32
THATS CUTE AS FUCK CAN THIS BE A REAL AU PLEASE,30
my name is am.... . . . AMOGUS,109

Man, Omori very much love his name,2
This is so wholesome omfg thank you for posting this,2
Now OMORI works there too, huh. How could this change the game if this could actually happen?,2
awww,2
Cute!,1
ong us,1
This over here,is beautiful,1
Funny thing is that Omori has/had good intentions and only wanted to protect Sunny... I give it a pass as it is a valid interpretation,409
Same,26
omori is sunnys siblings Canon then lmao,53
Who cares about repost. Thanks for sharing,37
I’m melting,4
I interpret that headspace exists even before what happened,28
Sus,25
>!Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and, desert you!<,14
>!i mean, he kinda isn't!<,7
Omori can be a girl on the Omori route.,28
there was supposed to be a gender pick option but it was scrapped in dvelopment, probably because spriting reasons but idk,19
I already credit them,7
Yes, that is what makes it sad, OMORI only wanted to help Sunny in the only way he knew, even if he didn't know the best,225
The bad thing is that those good intentions don’t have good morals behind them,122
Yeah, it's like, Badeline,. . >!but alot more murderous.!<,40
I mean, that’s just canon, right? The idea that Headspace has been reset countless times, with Black Space growing with each reset was pretty clearly stated in Deeper Well. I like to imagine that this specific comic happened in an loop prior to the events of the game.,20
ding ding ding ding ding ding ding,28
>!Take on me! Take me on! I'll be gone, in a day or twooooooooooo!<,9
what,10
sorry didnt see,4
the path to hell is paved with good intentions,57
Omori was like a loyal guard dog, he would do anything to protect his master, and didn't have the capacity to understand the consequence of that.,133
Dude, this is a GREAT example. Some points are controversial, but still. At the very least, Badeline was simply afraid that Madeline would not be able to reach the summit, since she knew the power of the Mountain from the very beginning. And, well, Maddie didn't want to listen to her at first. Omori, on the other hand, decided to help Sunny, trying to kill him by guilt.,27
I fucking love Omori x Celeste crossovers. People could say it and I'm sure most people would understand. And I agree, Badeline and Omori are basically mirror images (You know, >!Badeline DID try to kill Madeline with fucking lazers, spikes, and energy balls!< sooooooo maybe they are even more alike than you once thought before.,12
Badeline turned into a fucking tentacle monster which shot lasers, omori is just a manifestation of sunny’s pysche,1
Actually, no.  While it is canon that sunny often daydreams, it is unknown when headspace was created.  There can be a lot of 3 day loops in 4 years, and the fact that it’s all a dream makes the loops difficult to count.  One of the white space cutscenes suggest Omori was created after white space, and branch coral says white space is a place to survive, and therefore unneeded before “the incident”,12
ding ding ding. . **BOM BOM**,11
You can get a gender change potion from Medusa (I think) on Omori route after you feed Humphrey.  . It only works outside of battles and wears off each time you enter one. But you can actually enter the women toilet room while it works.,53
yep.,2
wheter or not that'd actually be fatal is debatable tbh,,2
to be fair so was Badeline,. . its just that Celeste Mountain is hella magic.,1
…I’m not seeing how this counters what I said. I’m stating that Headspace has been through numerous resets, which is shown in Deeper Well:  . “When your intentions become hazy, they will transpire into this world like a thick fog. You will know when it happens. It has already happened before. […] Will you be doomed to repeat this cycle over and over? Or will you break it?”. . As for Black Space’s apparent growth, Kite Kid in particular gives a good hint off the top of my head:  . “[…]sometimes when I'm looking up at my kite, I catch a glimpse of a DARK VOID in the sky from the corner of my eye. I used to see it very rarely, but these days it's been happening much more frequently. I wonder if it means anything...”,9
BEENISS?. . MORE LIKE BEEN-SUS!. . AÀÁÂÃÄÅĀĂĄ---,9
**AMOG US**,6
I googled it and wtf you're right,18
You're everywhere.,2
>!Spikes and lasers and energy balls and whatever she does when she catches you in Chapter 2 all seem pretty fatal to me!<,3
yeah,1
Oh, I thought you thought that headspace was created before “the incident” like the comment you replied to did,8
nah,1
To be fair, they do have a point. It could be interpreted that the spikes don't do much as Madeline was literally >!Falling through multiple sheets of spikes at the beginning of the chapter!< >!implying that most deaths may not really be canon and things thought up by Madeline. Simply trying to avoid getting hurt at all. If the spikes were all in her mind they who knows how much Badeline would actually hurt her?!<. . Though I would honestly argue those to be the most fatal hazards.,5
I assumed the original comment was referring to the events of the game as “what happened,” so I officially don’t know what the heck is going on around here at this point.,2
>!We know that Badeline is tangible while on the mountain (or Madeline has some mad telekinesis powers), so it's probably safe to assume the hazards are also tangible. There's an interesting theory that each death is Madeline overthinking about what would happen if she was killed by those hazards, implying they're not just in her mind and are tangible. As for falling through those crystals, you definitely got me there. Maybe they were Great Value!<^(TM)>!crystals or something.!<,4
"what happened" is >!ayo the pizza here!<,4
Exactly what I am saying! I use "in her mind" as a way to portray that maybe those hazards don't really hurt her as much as she thought. I definitely agree with the overthinking theory as it adds to her character and even more context to the story. It is also even more interesting as >!In chapter 5 Madeline literally plummets into spikes as she wasn't prepared! She had no start of room to try to plan out what she wanted to do. She expected the confrontation with Badeline to go one way and that could be proven as in that scene it is impossible to die (normally).!<,2
the more important question is. . . . if Hero isn’t pregnant anymore what is he doing outside of the kitchen,824

It’s a joke that hero would be the pregnant one,11
hero is an adult and this is a very unserious joke post template if mari lived,19
HERO is 19 in this image, as seen by his blue vest that appears in present faraway town. which clearly states that MARI must be 19 as well due to their age similarity. therefore it isn't necessarly creepy and it's only for a joke because they're legal adults and not minors.,16
omori fans when actually playing omori 😖😖😖😖😖😖😪😪😪😪🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬,13
Hero is 19 (and this post is very obviously a joke lol),14
Hero is legit an adult huh 😭,8

People who treat weird or NSFW fanart of fictional characters the same as an actual thing - that would be a serious issue - are the same type of people who believe video games actually turn people into psychos. And this is going by their logic. . Edit: Oh, and like everyone else said, Hero and Mari are actually 19, so...,3

Oh my Konami, this better be canon.,1
I think I would be very surprised that my name was inspired by a Nintendo game.,178
Mari : " I can speed run from the 2nd floor to 1st floor too mom look!",48
Given that it’s been sorta deciphered that the game takes place in the late 90s or early 2000s, it’s safe to assume the cast was born in the late 80s,160
the game probably takes place somewhere in 1990 so I think sunny was born somewhere around 1980,60
Well hero was born sometime in the 90's so by doing math we can assume that it takes place any time between 2009 and 2019 in the main game,11
Definitely in the 80's, Mari and Hero in the early 80's while the rest were born in the late 80's, while the RW gameplay takes place in the early 2000's. . I have a bad sense of time so this probably makes no sense at alll,7

As much as I hate to say it, most of the blame would probably fall on Basil. In Sunny's case, it was a complete and unfortunate accident that you couldn't really hate him for. His reaction afterwards was natural, that of a traumatised kid, locking himself away. Basil, despite having good intentions to try to protect/save his closest friend, made things terribly worse by fabricating a lie that literally everyone believed and possibly blamed themselves for...and, besides Sunny helping Basil carry Mari downstairs, it was entirely Basil's plan in the panic of the moment. It definitely doesn't help that they'd be finding this out on Sunny's last day there...,591
looks legit,216
This is certified negan moment,142
WATCH YO JET SIS. . WHAT YO JET,103
AUBREY NO-,192
Forget everything else, THIS is the canon reaction of what happens after the game ends.,299
Let's send you to have picnic with Mari again.,86
I love Aubrey lmao!  She hits Kel in game and I love it! :),41
We have Aubrey and hero version... I wonder how kel would react. . . . Also, canon,32
lmao. damn I really wanted to see the canon reaction, but I bet it would have been something similar to this. no way, Aubrey would just accept it and hug both of them. she was the character I felt most bad for. this summer break will be probably worse than the one when she lost her og friends.,27
People keep talking about Aubrey and Hero beating Sunny to a pulp,but everyone seem to ignore the fact that Basil was the one who put Sunny up to framing the murder as a suicide to begin with.At best,they would shun him,and at worst his head will be used as batting practice.,127
Ah yes, the sequel to "Hero tagged you",16
I didn't finish yet. I accidentally clicked on this.. . ...,10
nnnnooooOOOOO,6
This is completely awful and goes against her character in the good ending. For one, she already showed remorse for having wrongfully accused Basil of ruining his photo album, bullied him, hurt him and nearly killed him before and hated herself for doing all of this. She would understand Basil and Sunny for what they did, because she followed nearly in their footsteps and made many worse ones.. Second it would be wring to beat down children, who have guikt-tripped and nearly killed themselves for what they did and shows such an astonishing lack of empathy that cannot be excused at all. It's disgusting really. . Third and finally, they are all good friends and promised each other to support one another after they failed to be there once, so them beating up Basil and Sunny would be even worse than what these two did to Mari, since this whole thing was an accident and they wanted no one to blame Sunny for it. . . It's a disgusting picture if I say so, it completely insults this game's message about friendship and forgiveness. One can disagree with the message, but it's beyond cruel and very obnoxious to think that this is going to happen.,4
[deleted],8
I feel as if that unfortunately none of them.should face legal action because in japan (which I'm assuming this is based in) the legal age of criminal recondition is 14 so if they do they might be thrown in jail or a mental hospital.. But I do think that they need therapy (sunny and basil) and maybe a few slaps from hero and Aubrey after what happened afterall they were the closest to mari.. . . Sorry if I'm late,3
this is canon for me, thanks!,11
wheezes,3
Finally, something REALISTIC. I always found it so weird everyone thinks they just hug it out after admitting to a murder they covered up for 4 years.. . Even if Sunny comes out okay since honestly, I could understand HIS side. Basil def dies.,3
Oh no,2
I mean I head cannon they forgive them but I also head cannon that this happend,2
is this in the actual game?,2
Say goodbye to ya kneecaps pally. . BONK,2
omg seventeen reference based,1
Not to the current topic, but where the pic redrawn from?,1
I might be *slightly* late but I feel like a good one for *aubrey tagged basil* would be Aubrey pushing basil from the hospital roof,1
Aubrey: “Get your stinky ass up we going to Burger King!”. . Basil: “I am literally mentally scarred! Burger King will just make it worse!”,1
,1
It is also important to remember Basil considered Sunny his best friend, I know this doesn't make him innocent, but at least it is a fact that he would be pretty desesperate in that situation, and would try his best to make his friend safe.,239
Basil did make it worse for everyone, but he also made it worse for himself. Jut saying "It was Basil's fault" ignores the pain that he's experiencing. He was also like 12 when it happened. Not only was his brain developing, it was being put under stress that a developing mind shouldn't be under. I doubt that most people would have been able to make a better choice at that age, especially considering Basil and Sunny's relationship.,63
We have an unreliable narrator who has a living shadow inside of him thats trying to destroy him the entire time though, I can't entirely remember but don't they show an expression on Sunnys face in the dark photo album where he seems calm and collected? I don't think it was solely basil's plan, I see two 12 YEAR OLD KIDS trying to approach something that most adults wouldnt be able to.,36
[basil be like](),5
I can hear this comment,22
AUBREY YES~,67
The two of them deserve at least a couple of punches to the face and definitely some legal punishment, but they deserve some hugs, too. The traumatized boys finally facing their greatest fear and decide to take responsibility for what they did. I'd say they deserve some credit for not just killing themselves and instead doing the brave thing.,189
I love Kel but for some reason he seem to be the neighborhood punching bag.Everyone him and Sunny fight want to kick his ass the most.,89
Kel is just trying to stop the two from killing Sunny and Basil-,34
Yes! We need a Kel version XD,16
The whole game is about forgiveness, I doubt theyd hurt either of them.,169
The wording of murder puts a bad taste in my mouth since Sunny never had plans of killing his sister. Both of them heated in the moment lead from yelling, to blocking the staircase, to Sunny pushing Mari. There was no premeditated plan to kill her. Basil on the other hand had to purposefully think of something awful to do which makes him a little more unnerving to me.,55
CRY LOL,7
balls,2
Not to mention that Hero is staying for a few months.. Yup.This is gonna be a LOOONG summer break for Basil!,34
I had the distinct feeling that Faraway is somewhere in America, not only because of the general "American suburb feel" including the Church, but because Omocat herself is asian-american.. . Plus none of the kids (including the other town kids) have distinctively japanese names.. . If they got legally in trouble they'd get sent to juvie, which seals those records upon turning 18.,36
There’s actually bonus content on an alternate route which tells you exactly what Sunny was thinking the entire time. He couldn’t process that what was happening was real and he kept trying to force himself to wake up. He was totally delirious and didn’t even realize what they were doing and didn’t fully realize Basil was even there until Basil grabbed his hand after they were finished hanging the body. All he heard was a voice say “it’s gonna be okay, follow my lead” and he went along with it while barely knowing what was happening. Honestly I do mostly blame Basil, although I know he was just trying to protect his friend, he made everything so much worse for everyone.,268
**OH FUCK**,5
,2
I feel like Basil made something that Sunny should have dealt with his own issue making both of their lives worse in the long run. Basil should have never got involved with the incident whatsoever.,130
wait, a couple 12-yearolds deserve punches to the face and legal punishment (that will absolutely destroy their lives, by the way) because >!one of them couldn't control emotions and accidentally pushed his sister down some stairs and the other loved him so much, he helped him make it look like a suicide so he won't get his life destroyed (see above)!<? what the fuck is wrong with you and why do you want to destroy children anyway?. . (the rest of the post is right on tho, sounds like u got the secret ending :3),88
I'm not one for retributive justice. They're obviously not a danger to anyone and all they 'deserve' is therapy. That said, I can't say it wouldn't be satisfying for them to get slapped a little.,35
a reasonable judge would acquit them because they've suffered long enough: they are absolutely crippled with guilt and traumatized for events they've done 4 years ago,30
Pretty sure Basil's been getting punches to the face for years now,1
Yeah, that's prob cause he's been against Aubrey all of the time and all the kids seem to be on Aubrey's side,53
Or Sunny and Basil from killing themselves,13
The himbo is the most emotionally stable of them all. So....,27
Yeah, exactly my thoughts! I think Aubrey may come around to forgiving them, at least sooner than Hero would I think. It kinda helps (or hurts depending on your POV) that she was ALMOST in the exact same position as Sunny was when she pushed Basil into that lake.,112
Kel is definitely kind (or dumb, depending on how you see it) enough to forgive Sunny and Basil within a few days (or less-). Kel isn’t the kind of person to hurt any of them though. Hero would be really mad, from what we here from Kel, Hero was really hurt by Mari’s death, and learning this can make him snap (And I’m not sure if he’ll ever be able to forgive Sunnr or Basil) he also wouldn’t actively try to hurt either, that’s just not who he is. The only person who would (or could) hurt Sunny and Basil is Aubrey, but she almost got a taste for manslaughter after pushing Basil into the lake. I doubt any of them would *hurt* anyone, but I also have my doubts that they’d all forgive Sunny and Basil,36
I wouldn't say the game is about forgiveness, it's more about dealing with guilt and the journey to overcome it. Forgiveness is up to our interpretation.,71
The game is about forgiving *yourself* and coming clean, regardless of the outcome of doing so.. . There's no guarantee that the protagonist's friends would forgive *him*.,25
Basil marking out the photos made aubrey so mad she relentlessly bullied him, i doubt she would forgive them. At least not at first.,6
it’s better worded as Manslaughter,23
Isn't that what third degree murder is,3
It is possible for minors to be tried as adults, but that would be unlikely in this situation. That being said, Sunny and Basil probably aren't ever going to be able to get their lives in track.,3
You get most of those details on the good ending route as well. You also get the text from Sunny's perspective. Specifically being confused about how light Mari's body was let's me know he barely even knew Basil was there,129
You can't blame a kid for that.,23
Eh, I'd say we don't actually get enough details to judge; plus Basil was just a kid who wanted to protect his friend, I wouldn't say that most of us as children would come up with a plan as fucked up as his, but at the spot, seeing the usually calm and collected Sunny breaking down, it's fair to want to protect him from the law. Basil just went way too far in the midst of panic. And to be fair, if we were to toss morality aside, his plan worked. It's just that it back fired emotionally on everyone, that's the price of protecting Sunny from the law.,189
Basil was there for a friend, i wouldnt say i'd do what Basil did, but i'd definitely help my best friend none the less,21
We all know how well that went with the bad endings...,7
normally the bimbo isn't the shortest, and yet he is.,1
Can you imagine if Basil died there?,45
That's what I said, Basil and Zunny forgive each other and themselves,20
I agree, this does seem possible.,2
I don’t remember this, and I did that route.,27
Maybe “blame” isn’t the right word. What I mean is that Basil is at fault for just how bad the situation became. I’m aware he was a kid and he was panicking and trying to protect his friend, but if Basil hadn’t staged it as a suicide (I know Sunny did too but he was delirious and just following Basil’s lead), then things would have turned out very differently. Staging as a suicide made things so much worse.,41
I call it bullshit. Involuntary manslaughter committed by a 12 year old kid, what they did in response is just illogical whether if they panicked or not. My guess is that Basil was already fucked in the head to come up with framing suicide.,27
Yeah I say now I wouldn't do what Basil did, but I'm quite sure if I were younger I would- that is exactly a thought that would go through my head,12
The whole game I was expecting Basil to die or kill himself at any moment. I went for the good ending first though because I love basil he's very very cute. Haven't done the other routes/endings yet.,95
The photo album for the truth has descriptions. It didn't say to hit shift to read them, but the text was there. You can go read the descriptions for the pictures online, but it's quite upsetting.,72
Or you know, the themes about carrying on, the respectful separation of the painful memories from the good memories, the fact they are all actual children who would have no idea how to react to a situation like that and such a tragedy. I've seen my fair share of fucked up things in this life, and two kids who find themselves staring at the abyss and years of therapy might just actually band together to protect each other while they try to process it. This game is brilliant and I don't think you're going to be able to put yourself in the shoes of a kid whose experienced that.,40
The ones that seem fragile, hopeless and precious in horror games always die first/early; if they don't, they're always hiding some heinous shit inside of their little heads.,62
God me too! Like the second we saw Basil in the first day I knew he wasn’t ok. I did get some of the other bad ending but at least I got the good one first above all.,10
Oh shit it did?,30
Ya, check the wiki. The photos are all from Basil's perspective, but the descriptions are from Sunny's.. . I believe the specific photo description you're looking for is "Photo of Support",60
CARROT YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN WITH THE BEAUTIFUL ART!!! The outfit Sunny is wearing really feels like something he would actually have on, including the face mask. Also, the little detail of Something in the background is really nice!,222
Ah yes, the SOMETHING in the distance. . Don’t worry sunny you can report them to the police for stalking,211
If Sunny was a city boy the plot wouldn't have happened >!because they would have gotten complaints from the neighbors about the music so no stairs.!<,253
I can't stop looking at this. Wow...,65
I-I want that hoodie,61
Ok, this is the best omori fanart I’ve seen, congrats, I’ll wait for my free award so I can give it to u,38

Yooo your artstyle is amazing. Do you post on any other sites like insta?,25
Damn. Sunny got some serious drip.,20
AYO WHAT SOMETHING DOIN BACK THERE👀👀👀,33
MAN, Sunny lookin' like a model. Carrot, you make every character look 10x more flattering.,13
why does it have to be so foggy,11
his fit go CRAZYYYYYYYY,10
My headcanon is that Faraway is in New York, and Sunny moved from the suburbs to metropolitan NYC, so Sunny is now wearing a face mask because he has to deal with the coronavirus,10
Oshieteo,11
Ayo- Ayo Sunny there's something behind you- Damn he can't hear us he has airpods in,9
Big Kaneki vibes! . . Great art!,14

Bro looks like he's about to reveal a horrifying truth about my reality and/or offer me a red and a blue pill, and I mean this in the best possible way,1

capitalism dont care . . \-Kel,5
comrade Mari is the last thing I expected to see today, but I welcome it,13
at my old job I would just stuff the bag as full as I can,4
Maridonalds, for those of you in the discord,5
Lol she would be one of those spoiled teens,10
She doesnt leave orders hanging at least,3

Guys she's just saving money for university thats it. Like a part time job in maridonalds,3
Suddenly, McD is now my favourite fast food restaurant,3
Aaaaaaaaa it's too adorable,3
Wait, since Mari's dead.... . IS THAT GHOST MCDONALDS?,3
Mari forgets to give one extra nugget to Sunny. . The next day. . Sunny:Your time has come,3

yooo remember to credit op!!! btw the original artist here is uhhh @/RAlNYSTORMY on twitter :smirk:,5
AU idea: they order chicken nuggets instead of pizza and mari is delivering it,2
nuggies,2
now we just need the sweetheart Wendy Vs Mari MC donalds,2
Wait she is a commie? Oh man liberty prime is not going to be happy about this,8
Hey did you uh, ask the artist before uploading this?,4
New headcanon: mari works at ghost macdonalds and she fixed the ice cream machine,1
mari would definitely be a music teacher tradwife, this hc seems kinda out there,1
Nice art theft,-3
I'm pretty sure this isn't OP's art unless they are @RAINYSTORMY on Twitter, this person stole this. Edit: I see they credited the artist, still though it's petty art theft for what? Internet points?,-3
FUCK CAPITALISM,1
omg mari at mcdonal,1
"Fuck capitalism!" Mari said, with a smile on her face whilst putting in another nugget for the customer.  . . Now imagine that in the lost library,1
Communist Babil approves this,1
“The more Nuggei in the pack,the more customers we gain.”—Mari,117
Then he gets Infinite nugget when he show up.,68
she has nothing to lose but her chains >!and a jump rope!<,51
It is the second lowlight of mine.,27
Yeah but not that “Hang”,49
>!She's hanging alright!!<,35

It's still just using somebody else's art for internet points.,9
No, he's clearly a CIA agent.,8
Lol,3
But the Macdonald gain more customer so spoil teen isn’t that bad lol 👀,7
I put the link to artist those.,3

:D,-2
Hope you do well!,-2
Uhm....no but I credit the artist.,-1
I put the artist link and yes that not my art.,1
I put the link to the Artist those,I’m not gonna steal it.,3
I do it for content and interaction you can go like for the artist.,2
Ye,36
Is that the plural of nuggie?,20
Eternal ~~banana~~ nugget,35
What in the love of god and everything sacred is this account name of yours?,22
Vurgil,6
At least I give credit and don’t act like that’s my art.,20
In a way it’s promotion, I didn’t know about the artist until I saw this post,10
Just because someone made a small mistake doesn't mean you can go to their other posts and say rude shit. They made a post to apologize and you still went and harassed them about it.,4
posting interesting content you found elsewhere online is literally the point of reddit,7
Oh so that’s why Sunny pushed her off.. . A true patriot,4
I don't wanna sound mean but you should probably ask before uploading someone's work next time,5
Big Sis is not just a pianist, she’s also a best marketing girl.,46
I don't know, maybe >!Mari's spirit!< knows.,17
motivated moment,5
virgin,3
Credit in the post next time, barely anyone is gonna lookat that comment,15
We made up and are on good terms now,3
Ok but the Artist sometime not gonna response much so when I upload Will alway credit the artist.(That’s not my art and I understand what should i do).. . I upload it on Reddit because just for content and I want to see more interaction with people who are Omori Fan more cause Twitter seem pretty low interaction there and Twitter have a lot of “problem”,hope you understand.,-1
The tought of Mari knowing about that shit scares me to a whole new level that I didn't knew existed,19
Next time you should probably ask.,7
I'm sorry.,13
Sure I will.Only they answer or not.,2
We know you are not,17
,6
My Twitter account have a little bit of problem so I can’t not chat with the artist for now.. . But if you can tell him that I’m sorry cause I didn’t asked him about that yet.. . But I will credit the artist and not me.,1
i dont have a twitter,3
Oh that’s alright cause I just do that so thanks.,1

Brazilian Miku when she Aubrey ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|surprise),141
It's been 4 years, I JUST realized why Aubrey's toy is an eggplant out of all things.,79
Aubrey really enjoyed it when it's Sunny outside,71
Nice artwork,41
what’s up with this recent trend,19
Excellent work pal!,16
Love the green,20
First Brazillian Basil (HE SERRRRBBBBB FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE) and now we got Brazillian Aubrey (SHE IS ARGENTINIAN FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE wait....),22
Well done art piece! 🙂👍🏻,9
,40
Holy shit this fucking amazing omfg,8
This ate I'm dying ,7
It’s spreading,8
Great art! Though I don't really understand why there's so much Brasilian character art around, you did a great job 👍🏻👍🏻 ,9
Brazilian Hatsune Miku coming back to Twitter in a "disguise" :,7
I love it, good work 🇧🇷🧉,6
While I understand the reference I think it could have been better to choose an adult like Polly instead of a 16 years old girl.,17
She got a lot of Sun ,5
Ive realized now that i can simp for her all i want since we're literally the same Age. I got 2/3 years worth of Aubrey simping Left then it's over,8
She's so pretty,4
awww she's awesome!!!,3
,4
Brazilian Aubrey drawn like this? Great. 👍. . In my mind, her personality would be Kel 2.0 but with a more focused vibe and far less goofy.. . Maybe her weapon would be a soccer ball? Or maybe she is a cooking rival to Hero, with an amazing *Moqueca* versus Hero’s *Caldo de Res*.,2
Pika,2
BRAZIL NUMBER ONE 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷,2
First Brazilian Basil now Aubrey  can't wait for Brazilian Sunny,2
A question I would like to know because I'm not from Brazil. Do Brazilian people actually wear less clothing than normal, or is it another reason that I'm seeing every brazilian fan art with fewer clothes?,2
The hair transition really brings it all together,2
THE BRAZILIAN MIKU HAS FOUND EVEN AUBY😭😭,2
THE DETAILS, I CAN'T, IT'S TOO GOOD,2
,2
Would.,2
Brasil numero uno!!!! campeao mundo!!!  🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷,5
very cute! (´ω｀\*),3
Am I the only one who thinks it's really gross to be drawing child characters in overly sexualized ways? Like she's 12-16 for most of the game she does not need to be pictured with a thong out in a crop top ?????,3
this great much better than my art,2
,1
,1
As a Brazilian thank you this is incredible,1
Outro brasileiro por aqui?,1
,1
could anyone explain this trend,1
I wasn't expecting it to spread this much lol,1
where are her clothes,1
Bazil would have love this,1
Love love love!,1
The outfit doesn't seem the most... whatever. Suppose these things being inflated by the demographies they are meant for is noticeable at times, that much is for certain.,1
This is GORGEOUS . . . And also I'm dying over that hair gradient, the pink and the teal/mint look SO GOOD FAM,1
,1
Isn’t Aubrey like 17 during the game? This art feels kind if weird tbh,-9
i hate this trend so much,0
himitsu dayo ?,0
Wait I think I commented a little too much,87
Yup, very adorable,32
Brazilian:,9
Why?,23
OH MY GOD.,3
god i hate the fact that every time someone says to me: "its sunny outside" i physically have to refrain myself from saying "oh my god sunny from omori",74
Holy sh!t sunny from omori,1
One person drew a Brazilian Miku, and it became popular,36
serb basil?!,10
,19
Nuh uh,8
it’s the revengeance,3
Someone did Brazilian miku and it became a trend. There's even Brazilian mari,2
Yeah, that drawing seems a little too sexualized to me.,1
this you?,3
Good for you, but after that, you can have a seat.,2
Dang bro never thought of it like that,2
I mean, it's South. Noone wears full clothing on south. It's too hot.,3
Listen; just in fricking miami, you dont wanna wear full clothing (pants, long sleeve shirts❌, shorts, t-shirts ✅), or you will become toast. I cant imagine in brasil, closer to the equator, and with no winters,2
,1
you’re still learning, don’t compare it like that💖,3
comparison is the thief of joy,1
So it been 7 months, how is your art?,1
Long story short, brazillian miku and then everyone copied it into their fandoms,1
Fbi:. . ,0
As a brazilian, I can confirm she's just dressed like any other brazilian girl of her age would,7
Ur the weird one ,5
Bro did it all in 1 minute too,56
Clam down. . ,19
Aubergine is a term for eggplant,114
Because she likes eggs and veggies?,11
its sunny outside,21
Omori brain rot is real,20
his real name is Vasily,6
Considering that the outfit of brazilien miku was meant to be the representation of a latino milf, it's normal that this is sexualized notably with string of the panty visible. Aubrey is not only too young for that type of outfit but it's also not her type too wear that or being happy like that. . . . This outfit would fit better with Polly since she is an adult and has a brown skin which can make it feel she is latino.,10
I'm not gonna lie, many br teens dress kinda like that sometimes, partially bc it's a hot place and the other part bc idk it's common enough, teens like to act like adults ig,4
Naw Bru i'm on that enemies to lovers grind yk? ,0
Even in winter?,1
Thanks for the explanation! 😊  . ^(but how did you find this post and comment after 7 months?),1
,1
i've improved alot. . ,2
Literally how? This is clearly suggestive,29
Why? I just feel like this sort of outfit seems inappropriate for a 17 year old,25
It's the best artwork ,8
It's also just how British people say it lol, everyone calls it an aubergine here,19
Ohh,11
It's because eggplants are also called aubergines.. Like, AUBERgines.,25
Probably? Idk what first comment guy realized,3
Oh my god sunny from omori,25
Surely we can't go out in swimming suit; I know this isn't the case, but still goes beyond the limits of decency imo, at least where I live. If in Brasil this is the standard and everyone is adjusted to it there's no problem I guess.,1
Yeah, I was talking about that, she's way too young to dress like that.,1
Ngl, I never seen adults dress like that in real life, maybe just in beaches.,1
Hear you loud and clear.,2
There's no "winter" there, in the classic sense.,3
^(between us, I saw a different post leading me to this post),2
. . QUICK, THE BIG MOLIO OF INNOCENCE, I WILL STAY SAFE IF IT IS IN EFFECT,1
I do agree that teens should wear less revealing clothes but they still wear stuff like this, especially in hot countries. I say for drawings 16 is a thin like of just about not weird for something like this,0
Thats rad.,6
[removed],12
Yup, sad that this is always the young member of the gang that people always pick on for that. I also admit that seing mommy Polly in this outfit would have been a pleasent view not gonna lie.,3
rio de janeiro. . . . and as I said teens over 14 can dress kinda like that in some places, in town/cities with beaches/pools they're everywhere. every store I go there are shorts that short and they're almost priority, crop tops aren't that much of a rare sight. teens and young adults are usually the ones who use those, especially in hot places. . this is probably more of a brazil thing, I guess? bc I've seen them many places through all my life. some people will judge, but they indeed exist, and are not as sexualized and rather normalized as it is a common sight in some places,5
^(good job finding me then),1
Pfft.,1
Idk man. This seems a little too much „less clothing“,12
Everyone has it's opinion on the matter and yes, not only I found this outfit inapropriate given Aubrey's age but this is also not in link with her personnality.,1
If they're normalized there there's nothing wrong, I guess.,1
I see your points and this is probably a culture difference but this is still an outfit who was supposed to be sexualizing for  adult which I find not to be for underaged girls, there's also the fact that the legal age of consent in Brazil is 16 which clearly contrast with many country.,1
^((quiet yippee sounds)),2
Yeah i guess its cuz they were copying the clothing miku had, I'd prefer aub had altered versions of her own clothing. But its not intentionally making things weird.,5
[removed],2
ngl I can't see it, also what's of the age of consent? we still see 16 as underage,1
"her character is being a rebellious teen" Wow what an incredibly deep understanding you have of the game's characters this is such a great argument.,2
Let just say the original material of where the characters was based was supposed to be for sexy latino milf, Aubrey while rebellious is certainly not an latino smilling girls, I have no problem with others opinion but I think the outfit is too sexualizing for Aubrey and this is not about the crop tops.,2
In many country, 18 but in Brazil and some country it's 16, in France it's even 15.,1
not what I meant,1
Didn't you ask me what's the age of consent?,2
I asked what's WITH the age of consent. we're not talking about dating or anything, it's about clothing picks. in really hot places people won't care much when someone doesn't want to be boiled alive,1
Ah sorry for that, I just think that Brazilien are more leniant to that because of the age of consent but maybe this is just me.,1
I don't think it's only about the heat, I don't think a man would wear that kind of clothing, not even in Brazil.,1
bc men are taught it's weird to use short shorts, and yet they use it sometimes. plus many older men can be shirtless and boy can I tell you their beer bellies are plenty visible on the outside of their houses sitting on a chair, and in places with public swimmable water. just don't enter premises or (obviously) go to your job shirtless ig, maybe in some bars, especially in small towns. these clothes are decent enough bro, they won't arrest u for that, maybe some old ppl talking shit about u but as long as ur not just ugly or nearly naked it should not be a problem,1
not only did the drawing impress me as a whole, but the hidden "Everything's going to be okay" phrase just adds more intensity to the mood of the art. truly a splendid work your brother did there. tell him that he should be proud for such skills of his. he deserves all the praises and compliments.,239
Fun fact, did you realize in the lower part of the drawing it says "Everything is going to be okay"?,430
Tis I, the brotha,95
Very impressive,68
I can see why,36
Love the details with the shading and the text on the stairs!,24
When pointilism becomes "What's the point anymore"ilism (not what's the point of the artwork, I mean like depression because omor, you get what I mean),25
This looks like official artwork omg,20
,17
props to your brother because this actually looks really hard to make  . also, the way how the dots are constructively placed makes it absolutely stunning. your brother nailed this art piece with a 10/10 from me,13
This is how your brother felt when making this. . ,4
Pointillism. . Your brother has a good attention to detail, I love the writing,3
AMAZING,2
I love how Something looks. It's the best drawn Something I have probably seen.,2
That's a goated brother + art teacher right there,2
I thought the Something was official art for a second-,2
,2
Cool,1
Impeccable,1
Duuuuuuuuuude that's so awesome,1
This is peak,1
This is freaking awesome,1
Very good art. SOMETHING is telling me your brother is very talented. Lol, yeah, good art!,1
Fun fact: A lot of people here are saying this is pointillism, but it isn’t, it’s stippling. . Pointillism is a painting technique that requires multiple colors and is to be viewed at a distance where the dots are not discernible from each other. . Stippling is often monochromatic, but isn’t required to be, and can be done in a variety of mediums. It also relies on spacing between the dots to give the illusion of depth, texture, and shadow.. They are very close in theory, but it’s interesting how one uses dots to appear as a whole and the other uses dots to separate near from far, light from dark, and rough from smooth.,1
maann this really deserved the A+,1
Stand proud, because your brother did an absolutely amazing art.,1
If he got any less I would kill your teacher.,1
tell ur brother that hes super cool,1
Oh my god. That’s incredible! Also the hidden everything is going to be ok is absolute perfection!!!,1
The "everything is going to be ok" in the staircase hits so hard. Your brother is a great artist!,1
HOW COULD THEY GIVE HIM AN A+ (they should have told him that he no longer needs to attend the course because of the sheer quality of this piece of art. it's truly amazing.),1
One word: beautiful,1
Whoaaa damn,1
stippling..... blegh.,1
3 words: Basil. Is. Coming. JUST KIDDING :) ,1
Man, this drawing is amazing!!! . (If there is any English error, please forgive me, I am Brazilian and I am learning English now). . He was very creative and intelligent for choosing to draw this specific scene, imagine having to dot the scenarios of the dream world (I'm new here so I don't know what they call that part after the white space, sorry),1
this is literally ART. peak shit 🔥,1
I already did. I told him that I was gonna upload it and he thought I was gonna send it on discord. Matter of fact: he lost his shit the moment he realized this was reddit instead 😭,74
I never noticed the "Everything is gonna be okay",6
U R indeed,39
Good job brotha,18
are you omocat,11
Yeh,2
My literal thoughts exactly ,9
LMAO SO TRUE 😭,3
The art teacher was speechless but also a but scared lol,2
I wish I could have seen everyone's reactions, I bet they would have been priceless,2
He appreciates all of your positive comments so much,  ut he can't reply 'cause now he's at school, he's on his second to last year of Junior high and I had just finished High school. We're both artists, but while he loves drawing on paper, I prefer digital, for example, this is something I drew for fun.. . ,2
I mean... If you look it a bit far, it's hard to see the dots. Also you may not know this, but mangas use pointillism or stippling when it comes to give color to a shirt, hair, skin, background, etc.,1
Okay. PS: as he saw the amount of upvotes, he's dying of laughter,2
lol,1
lol. . good to know he's aware of his work being appreciated now. may both of you get to witness the huge achievements and exciting moments in the future. may his potential be realized and his life to constantly get better. same to you as well.,29
No he ain't. . ,14
Nice,1
Your view here is understandable (there are sooo many dot techniques in art). For instance while stippling is used rarely in manga, what your probably thinking of is Screentone/halftone, which is a sticker-esk sheet layer on top of the original drawing and is cut into shape before prints are made. Which is different from American comics where they commonly use ben-day dots. Dots that are equally spaced to give the illusion of a color between the dots and the background color or used as shading. Like I said, there are a lot of dot techniques. [Here]() is another post that confuses stippling with pointillism, and [here’s]() a video about screentones/halftones. The world of dots is actually very interesting and I recommend you and your brother check it out more.,1
Was Sans really edgy? I feel like the fandom just made him one,589
What are you talking about, Undertale barely came o- 7 YEARS!?,243
Sans isn't edgy he's the hotdog selling skeleton,165
Not me. I'm happy being different.,78
Sans isn't that edgy, the fandom just made him extra super mega ultra edgy ,65
Bro went from Edgy to Emo(honestly me too fr),55
Sans ≠ Edgy,30
Can relate with basil, I also wanna >! Off!<. Myself,45
Canon sans is me fr fr,19
i use to name myself sans and use a sans pfp everywhere, discord, instagram, tiktok, FUCKING GMAIL LMAO. but tbh, i don't see why being like sunny is a good thing, he is quite a mf that i love but i wouldn't want to be like him,17
I'm one of the few weirdos who allways related more to the shy nerds. Which is odd, because it makes more sense than relating to the edgylords (I did like them a lot, tho),15
shadow was never edgy, sonic team just decided to continue to use his character from the 2005 game, they thought that fans would love it because they thought he was very badass there,15
Literally same (trans too) ,131
I seriously cant accept the fact that sans is someone's childhood, it feels like undertale were just released yesterday,11
Bruh if sans was around when you were a kid, truth is you're still a kid lol,10
Literaly same, trans and went from edgy to depressed (and edgy),19
Honestly same. I was really into the Undertale fandom when I was a preteen. I still like the game, but it's not really my kind of thing, plus now I see how edgy and weird the fandom is.  . I only just recently got into Omori, and honestly I am really glad I did at this point in my life.   . I had just started actively trying to get out of a low-point in my life where I was self-isolating and living in my own world like Sunny, (thankfully that wasn't because of trauma in my case), and the game and it's message only reinforced my decision to start actively improving my mental health.  . (also fun fact: my closest friends from school, whom I haven't seen in over 6 months due to my mental health issues, have gotten into Omori WAYYY before I did and I had no clue lmao. At least now we have one more thing to relate about),6
I thought I was on r/traaaaaaaaaaa etc. and I was like, oh wow, Omori content.,9
Bro He Just Turned Wo[[Man]].,8
Kid named sans undertale,4
hello i am also a transfem omori fan ,10
Transfem and love Sunny and Basil. . . Just like me fr,8
 hm this is interesting,3
fellow snuy/basil kin I see,3
Glad to see another trans here! I'm agender and sunny is bae,3
You swapped genders? Ok,15
Congrats on your transition! You go girl🎉,5
I guess I still need to do some more growing up to do.. . . . Emotionally that is.,2
Depressed as a kid, Depressed as a teen, now an adult but still Depressed,2
she just like me frfr,2
Unpopular opinion: *I hate Sans Undertale.*,2
And you are still a edgy kid!,2
bro that was me when I was little /srs lmao. ,2
he’s literally me,2
Did you trans the gender.,3
sunny feels very trans-coded tbh,8
I'm in these fandoms still and I'm trans,4
why did you go from boy to girl,2
And now we're just edgy femboys,1
Me:  \-> She just like me fr,1
Hold up . . ***They also became trans***,1
I like Sans, but not the edgelord one, the memelord one.,1
yeah,1
Since I am a big Cars fan, i always thought “omg i relate to Mater a lot he just like me fr fr” and now K E L.. . ig i always kin the funnies lol,1
yikes,-3

I was always like that,1
Sans? I mean trans op?,1
ahahaha me,1
Nice,1
congrats on your 13th birthday,1
nah you're still a kid,1
For me it’s the stupidest person in the group lol,1
wait a minute you used the boy goth guy on top for a "old" version of you but then used the goth girl in the "new" version of you are you trying to tell us something,1
Basically the same thing but with less fur…or more fur in sans’ case,1
relatable,1
Removes shadow and adds madeline from celeste in the bottom. Bam, me,1
So you’re trans now?,1
Kel just like me fr,1
Yes i am a comic sans,1
Same,1
Id date basil he's cute,1
Sunny for the daydreaming and fantasizing, while Basil for the constant need of attention and chronic fear of the abandonment. I think we can all agree that these two are pretty relatable for the most of us,1
so what you're saying is that as a kid you put your weiner(s) on people's heads?,1
HOLY SHIT ITS SANS UNDERTALE,1
Switched genders too apparently,1
All of us (in some way):,1
Undertale and omori fans are the same I'm convinced,1
Bro changed teams💀💀,1
relatable ,1
I used to be like Kel, just funny weird guy. Then, I gone to school, I became Basil, I was really shy. Then, when I became a teen, I became Sunny, I lost hope in humanity so I just was here because why not? Then, when this year started, I became Something, I'm afraid of myself, help me. ,1
Wish I had basil's haircut,1
Why are so many comments going “uhhh sans isnt edgy lol” as if this is what the post is about at all? Lmao,1
you transformed?,1
Sans was just the funny bone man and the fandom just made him feel extremely edgy,486
He doesn’t even have a blue flame eye yet that somehow became his most establishing feature,9
People think he‘s edgy????,6
nah canon sans was fine,5
I dob’t find him to be edgy tbh, but I think people make him edgy because he murders you repeatedly during genocide (it’s deserved but still, kinda edgy),2
He was depressed. We know that.,1
Fr sans was just a greasy bone man who never pays for the food,1
WE’RE OLD!?!?!,75
Good games never get old,8
The sausage skeleton,29
The sunny with glasses PFP really sells this comment for some reason.,16
Oh, 69 updootes,1
You good?,19
That is not a very effective spoiler tag,9
Do you happened to like a character called Leiner,5
I like that someone else is referring to people as edgelords without talking about the jackasses who think actual harm is funny.,4
I know,6
really seems like all basil kinnies are trans huh (same),12
Yes,56
Holy shit samee ,20
People who were 14 and are now 21: ,17
The pipeline☕,2
same lol,2
SPAMTIB WIT LANGUAGE REAL🗣️🗣️🗣️,1
That omoji is soooo fucking unnerving for no reason,1
I’m trans,69
I was just about to make the same joke  . lmao,1
 I feel like the fandom just made him one,-1
Mood,1
He kinda does honestly, you can even turn him into a girl in headspace in the hikimori route. I think part of it is Mari being such an integral figure to Sunny which rubs off some of the cishet energy. . . I personally thought Sunny was really strongly autism coded though I’m autistic myself so maybe it’s just a case of Sunny being very imprintable on.. . The community can get oddly hostile though when anyone says they feel Sunny feels x coded.,9
could you elaborate?,3
why did this get downvoted, its just a harmless opinion ,5
trans,2
What,5
Don't make me kidnap you and regress you into a child,5
Tbf, he is a bit edgy in his fight.. . But in the other 90% of the game he is just a slightly nihilistic midle aged guy who likes dad jokes,329
Those AU Snas,19
On the surface he's the funny bone man we all know and love but deep down he's pretty nihilistic and depressed as can be seen in both the Genocide Route and the Soul Battle during Asriel's second phase.,8
I don’t find him to be edgy tbh, but I think people make him edgy because he murders you repeatedly during genocide (it’s deserved but still, kinda edgy),1
Yup,27
It’s a water sausage!,16
Wiener skeleton,7
pretty sure toriel would have loved that pun ,4
Damn,4

he is obviously the real lainah!!1 😱,1

 maybe its because of the smile,2
That's cool (--kel loves it,28
Oh I see, that's great!,28
Love it! We support you all the way fam,16
the big ones i’d say are the gender-change potion in the hikikomori route and the fact that the white space sketchbook drawing of the bathtub has a bra hanging up along with the rest of omori’s clothes,5
i reupvoted tjat,3
probably someone downvoting all the trans comments, based on what i’ve been seeing,7
,2
ohohoho there's a penis stuck in your washing machine,2
I don't think he is middle aged but I agree with you,108
kinda cant blame someone for being a bit more serious when they got a person about to destroy the fuckin world in front of them,49
*A person is literally ending the world, killed your brother and now you’re really mad at them and at life* . . Internet: Edgy!!,33
He’s more the vague kind of cool that can be misinterpreted as edgy by teenagers who are edgy themselves. You know… like me… and most of the rest of the fandom when he was popular…,4
Yeah that's the thing, he's edgy because Chara deserves it, unlike Shadow who is edgy to the common pedestrian.,3
,16
What about saness,9
Mmm AU Snas. We have angry snas, papyrus snas, snas but error, ino snas, dream snas, horror snas, nightmare snas, reaper snas, geno snas, alpha snas, error 404 snas, glitchtale snas, xtale snas, and a lot of other snases.,3

Welll I am not one of them but I used it as an example - but aside from that, hello old person :),1
(mood),1
oh yeah that’s an interesting drawing, i have a post about it,2
based username ,2
that sucks, i thought the omori fandom was more lgbtq friendly ):,3
Maybe middle aged was an exageration, but I can't see him with less than 30 years old for some reason,107
[removed],6
Yeah, but in his fight he can teleport, control gravity, has a glowing eye, a damage mechanic that supposedly involves karma, summons dragon heads that shoot lasers, and has a metal them. You can't convince me this isn't edgy. Though, it does makes for a good subversion of expectations,31
He wasn't acting edgy, but the way he's fight works and is presented is definitely edgy,14
Sr pelo was on LSD while creating him,9
uhmmmmmmm,8
What did he said?,3
yesssss i'm in  let's all commit crimes together,8
We put the T in uh... Tomori!,16
Kell yeah!!. . And also we have spaceboy! so close to getting a trans character in canon...,8
I'm genderfluid, bringing a little bit of pure chaos ,7
can i join?? ,4
I feel that. Godspeed to you, I've only worked retail for about 6 months but it was hell.,3
Hard to believe undertale came out that long ago now 😩💀,1
Edgy teenagers infest omori(+me). At that point expect sw@ts!k@'s and s!ckles,2
He obviously acts like 45-50 years old boomer but I still think he's actually around 25-30 years old,81
I think it's earned since he's so chill all the time and normally never interferes, so it's a huge shock when he suddenly turns out to be this all-powerful superboss,25
That’s…kinda the point, i think…? I’ve always felt the Sans fight was designed to be one giant flip on the whole mechanics of the game. all throughout genocide, you learn that HP is usually the biggest factor between a powerful enemy and a weak one, so when Sans comes in, considering you killed EX in a single shot, you still expect a fight, but not one that isn’t similar to the Undying fight, then he attacks BEFORE you get a turn, and uses his strongest attack FIRST just to add salt to the wound. When you finally get around to attacking him, instead of taking the hit, he dodges, even winking. . . Meanwhile, his attacks are some of the hardest in the game, despite his 1 damage, because there’s no real way to understand what just happened when you first get to a attack, his attacks are unorganized, platforming challenges in a game where your hitbox usually floats. He messes with the soul‘s gravity too. All the while you get hurt for every single frame you‘re in one of his hitboxes. . . Then his ultimate attack is to fucking sleep, figuring that the entire battle system has been on a trust system, he just never lets his turn end. This would’ve, in theory, worked, but through one of the most clever scenes in the game, you MOVE the bounding box to hit the fight button, and when Sans dodges, you attack AGAIN, finally getting the final swing in.. . Sans’ entire fight is designed to flip a concept of a superboss on it’s head, whilst still making it tough as nails, it isn’t your strategy being testing, like what you would think in a RPG game, it’s your skill, and THAT is clever. It also served as a good way to mess with people with the gaster blasters and shit. . . “OH MAH GOD SANDS KNOWS GASTAH!!111?//?1!” - every undertale fan when Gaster and Gasterblasters were first discovered.,25
Gravity control is also a Papyrus thing, to be fair.,1
I suppose that’s a word you can use instead of cool lol,10
DO YOU WANNA HAVE A BAD TOM!?!?!?! ,1
So what are we invading first,5
Tomatomori,17
Spaceboy is trans?!?!,8
MIZUKI PFP ,7
Yeah!!!!,3
fr though, in one way it feels like just a year ago or something but to me at least it also feels like such a classic that it must've been around longer than this?,2
Oh my god I have (partially) the humor of a middle aged person- No wonder my family loves me,31
He’s a skeleton though.,5
Well,when you live through uncountable time loops again and again while retaining sentience mental age might advance a bit more than the physical one.,6
There's a fine line between cool and edgy,6
transphobia headquarters,4
Genius.,11
Apparently? But the team didn't know that when putting him in the game so there's not much that alludes to that. I think someone asked about it with some art from some days before the game released and they said yes but the ppl working on the game didn't know,9
yay!!,4
Sans doesn't remember any of the events of the previous timeline. He is just aware it will reset again and again.,8
Will we bring Kel?,2
That is cool,4
One thing I heard about him remembering timelines is that he clearly doesn’t remember everything but more like small snippets of things from other timelines,1
of course we'll bring Kel,4
[oh here's a post with the screenshots w/ proof of it!](),6
Good, he is crucial for this operation,4
you gotta bait them bro,186
I had anxiety crisis and nightmares playing it . . Good game, play omori,135
Feel the depression with us I still get triggered whenever I hear final duet,69
Yeah true you need to tell that it is a good game then they realized what you showed them.,23
me before playing omori: psychological horror? haha sure it might be a bit scary but there's no way this cute little game could be that dark. . me after playing omori: i will never be the same again,17
SpoiLerTag,16
man i just made this exact meme, came here to post it, and then saw this. . . i snoozed and i...losed? lost.,9
Yeah so I've been depressed since I've played this game but it's a really good game and you should play it,11
The only way to not get shocked by omori is to be like me and Immediately go towards the Darkest Stuff, no "eyebleach" Breaks..  Just Going through all of it and Having as broken of a mental state as a Darkest Dungeon Character.. .   You'll become utterly Desensitized To everything else.,10
is it really normal that i felt nothing playing the game the whole game?  . i only got like two chills  . 1 is final duet  . 2 is when the something in the train called out the irl name not omori,6
9/10 of therapists recommend this game. You should try it.,8
I still remember finishing Omori and texting my friend that “yeah it’s a great game you should definitely play it :)!!!” while I was sobbing,8
Only thing that has ever made me cry 7 seperate times :,),6
A bit too relatable.,2
Thus the cycle continues,3
me: HEYOOO BUDDIES, go play omori heres my steam account-,3
We all can find peace within the pain!,3
Literally me XD,3
if i'm drowning in this hellhole, i'm dragging you down with me. /pos,3
gotta give them a nice time right,2
How Omori and Honkai Veteran Players feel about their respective games and story.,2
But some people are evil (me) and set it's a happy rpg game (◍•ᴗ•◍),2

Haha too true,2
yeah pretty accurate,1
Same with "Land Of the Lustrous",1
YES HALF A KEL!!! HI AGAIN!!,20

seeing others get anxiety crisises while all you felt was kinship towards sunny for finally developing it after the incident feels weird . . >!(proof is every basil encounter in blackspace doors)!<,1
The cutscene for it always breaks me,29
Agreed,3
i failed the resolve check horribly during final duet,9
Same, except i didn´t get chills,4
I didn't feel any chills or anything but dang the feels hit me like a brick wall.,5

That one part though ):,10
You still have a heart, GOOD.,4
I'm satan muhahahahahahhahahahahahah,1

That explains enough. I've been playing horror games for a long time and I've rarely had anxiety attacks playing them, that's why i love omori . . Take care of yourself anyway,9

Sorry for randomly replying after 5 months but I just wanted to let you know the OP isn't the artist :0 it's actually one of my good friends! I'll forward the message :),1
By the way, the poster is not the artist. I know the artist, we are friends. I'm sure he wouldn't mind but the poster isn't the one to ask.,4

Nice to see the maverick in a post,290
Turns out charismatic Hero is not so charismatic. . I really love how you drew Basil btw, definitely one of the more accurate portrayals I've seen of him ,308
Sunny saying “I’m gayer” made my day.,353
>"It's not a competition". . Sounds like someone's in second place.,244
Jesus fucking Christ Kel you can't just compare someone to Ellen like that...,219
Kel what the fuck,98
This (correctly) implies that The Maverick is also gay.,69
Inspired by @/ryuseipurple 's thread on twt. . Read the article it was based off of: ,35
>"It's not a competition.". . I will make it then,91
I have been stalking you for the past 100 years...,31
“It’s not a competition” tf it’s not,44
Basil, we need to talk.,46
"It's not a competition". . Yes it is. And I'm winning.,62
I love how you drew the characters. Like you made their hairstyles realistic without really changing them,14
epic post but GOD DAMN kel is ripped,12
Omg kel, anyone but ellen DeGeneres like please... ,11
I appreciate that you make Basil look like the most tired person on the planet.,9
Hi OP. Do you trust the safety of the collection of walls you refer to as your home? ,10
Ok but I love it so much congrats,6
Cool art but you still owe me 5$,8
I love this sm. . . Canon because I said so,13
amazing art bro,7
I can’t stop laughing this is amazing op,7
No no definitely say "I'm gayer",7
Ah yes, thank you for showing me how to be a true ally!. . Also, joking aside, this is fantastic artwork! Nice work!,11
I like your artstyle mate,6
Sunny like me Fr,7
THIS POST IS BRILIANT LMAO DDJDKA,6
Ok honestly Sunny going "I'm gayer" Is accurate as hell. I may just be pushing my Autism onto him but him joking around like that seems like it would be his way of showing he accepts Basil for who he is (Also Basil laughing at it knowing this),5
The ultimate response to someone coming out it “Hi gay, I’m dad.”,6
"You still owe me 45$" isn't about coming out , it's about JUSTICE AND ETHICS,6
If anybody said any of these things when I come out I'd either feel bad or laugh honestly.,9
I died of laughter when the Ellen Degeneres joke came up.,6
*currently screaming*,6
Amazing work! Love the lighting change for the last panel.. . . Also... *Got change for a $50?*,4
it's true.. . I *am* gayer.,5
hero how could you.........at least you didn't remind him ellen exists the worst thing a person can do.,4
Omg this is so fucking good,4
no offense but basil really is a closet made of glass,4
One thing you should never say when you come out is to >!never tell anyone that you help your friend cover up his murder!<,3
sunny would make it a competetion even if they were straight,3
Does this imply he came out to something?,3
Better than your hair M*verick,8
Why do they all look absolutely tired here,2
Damn fuck this flag rn,2
"I'm gayer" idk Sunny you're like the most bi person I've ever seen,2
Don't you mean ***THE MAVERICK?!?***. . Tch, & you call yourself a ***THE MAVERICK*** main?,197
Thank you for not dead naming Mikhael,15
I like to think he's unintentionally awkward! Like when he tried asking kel and aubrey to make up the first time he came home from college. Haha. . Thank you so much ,163
[removed],39
He's a perfectionist, much like his sister ,190
[removed],28
I'll be using it as a meme forever now.,17
r/sunnflower,18
“It’s not a completition” not with that attitude,5
The Maverick is beyond sexuality, he simply is,67
I mean considering in his fight he seductively winks at either Sunny or Kel to lower their attack yeah he is. . (Also considering it *worked* implies Kel and Sunny are too),39
I'm making it a competition better,13
^(Basil.). . Basil.. . #  Basil.. . Wake up, Basil. You have been asleep for the past 100 years...,15
Gotta one up each other to see who does the much gay stuff daily, then it’s tallied at next pride parade to see who is the winner,13
The LGBT communities worst enemy... the catholic church!,40
I'm gayer,20
Thanks! I love drawing the cast, glad you liked my rendition of them!,8
yes?????????should i??? Not???,8
Canon to anyone whos played the game,8
I see no evidence to dispute this, I’ll accept it as canon,8
*THE maverick,19
IM SO SORRY TOO ****THE CHADVRICK**** I'VE FAILED YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!,83
Who's maverick? That one kid named Mikhael?,32
Ah yes, "thank you for not deadnaming *deadname *" /j,38
When sunny is more gayer,6
I can greatly respect that ,66
With great gay, comes with greater gay abilities,33
>!didn't maris perfectionism get her killed?!<,6
I’d date someone if that’s how they asked me out, strong confidence to say “I’m gayer”,23
Ah, a fellow r/sunnflower member, always a pleasure to meet another.,15
There is nobody not attracted to *THE MAVERICK* so we cant say for sure,34
Thank you for further justifying the fanfiction I am working on, I appreciate it.,14
Olympics,7
I'm even gayer,16
I wouldn't, your walls are very easy to hide in :),5
I know the dread you feel for i foresaw it before you knew the feelings would exist  ,3
Sorry, I mean Maverickroll,9
Sorry mikhael, still not calling you that,6
His name is not “”””Mikhael””” it’s THE MAVERICK! Get it right you plebian,44
Kid named Mikhael:,6
Naturally,13
I think I can predict how snuuy will die,41
ayo fellow sunflower shipper,5
No problem!!,7
I'm olympicing better,9
I am the gayest bitch, I will suck the law's dick,20
,8
wow just straight up deadnamed him like that,10
There's no need for me to call it another name... Mikhael is already cool,14
>!Diving headlong down the Potemkin Steps in Odessa?!<,29
Ayo ,4
What? Mikhael is not THE maverick nor is he A maverick, from what I heard top gun: maverick sucks so it's actually better to dead name him,5
Stop trying to justify your Mavriphobia. It's 2022, no excuses for that.,7
And you stop trying to justify your mavriphillia, its 2022, no excuses for that,5
,7
That scene was so sweet. I loved it when Aubrey told Kel he was a gross color and Basil called the NAACP.,256
This is so **CUTE!**,91
Little do they know what will happen in the future.,76
[Source here!!!](),66
The scene has everything, bagel, suny, love and racism,34
Sunny and basil ain't got shit on Sunny and Aubrey,99
Aww, this is cute,22
It's beautiful. I've looked at this for five hours now.,29
Where’s Kel, was he yeeted into obscurity?,7
AW, this melts my heart.,7
i might not care for romance. . . but this is cute.,6
fofo,6
F U C K I N G Y E S,4
This is too cute I'm going to die help my heart isn't beating twice as fast as usual,2
I like how sunny looks somewhat uncomfortable with it, it's like he just want to stay friends which i like,-18
That on the hikikomiri route?,64
holy fucking shit  . . . racist aubrey,63
Maybe the true SOMETHING was the racism we made along the way.,8
based aubrey,3
But love still can fix it.,51
Nah both ships are cute,22
I would disagree,12
Just completely ignore it and go Basil + Aubrey!,5
Realmente, bem fofo,1
meanwhile, Sunny fantasizing about half a dozen Aubreys fighting over him in blackspace:,9
I think this is the raining scene from memory lane right before the final boss fight,65
Thats what I thought!,13
But it can't fix a >!Dead body or multiple dead body's depending on what you do!<,70
Ones cuter though,23
*We* would disagree,10
What have you brought upon this cursed land,30
hell yeah!,5
oh yeah i forgot about that,. . still i like the idea in my head that they're all platonic, except mari and hero,1
Ah yes, when Sunny stops repressing the truth that Aubrey is a gamer.,21
>!But it can fix mental heath!<,45
>!well I mean, in the true ending route based on what we see Sunny has confessed and gotten a huge burden off his chest, we also see basil smile at him implying that basil forgives him for telling everyone. What the other threes responses are is anyone’s guess!<,44
you’re right and that’s suntan babeyyyyy,7
Apes together strong,18
Yes,8
I mean none of them are actually in a relationship but Sunny definitely got something going on and Aubrey is implied to reciprocate,3
>!I'm headcanonning that they'll forgive them. Hero definetely would, because he would agree to much bigger things just for his friends to be happy. So would Kel, he wouldn't really care, I mean, would for a little time, but then understand things and move on. Not sure about Aubrey. But she probably would, too, as long as everyone ( not everyone ) is back and they are well, after some talking, especially Hero explaining her some important things, she would definetely get over it. At least, that's what I think.!<,22
Yes, suntan nation,2
Sun tan, excuse me?,3
>!I honestly think Aubrey would be one of the first to forgive Sunny since otherwise she would be a dang hypocrite. After what she'd almost done to Basil AND indirectly to Sunny at the lake if there wasn't Hero to save the day, she would also be in an even worse position with a) double the body count, b) her being 16 and c) a delinquent.!<. . >!Hero would be less forgiving, I think. In the end I also think he will forgive. It would take just a longer time than the others!<,23
Sunny & Kel,2
>!I think Hero will come around as he gets to know that it wasn't his fault, for "not noticing" whatever made Mari suicidal.!<,15
>!Well, of course, he can be mad for Sunny killing Mari, but he is a wise guy, he would understand that it was an accident, Sunny has suffered a lot and he does not need any more suffering. So, for short, I think they will be understanding and forgive them.!<,9
Hero definitely wouldn't be less forgiving,1
Where did you get the tan from?,5
Black bar goes brrr,2
How do you mark text as spoilers?,1
kel skin. . The one I don’t understand is sunburn,6
just use >!  !< and put your text inbetween to mark as spoiler,3
the lost library memory where Sunny lays on Aubrey's shoulder in the car and his face gets sunburnt because he doesn't want to move,5
Aubrey's personality "burns",4

Funny enough, what made us ultimately decide to do this was because my brother plays violin and I play piano lol,13

Downvoted into oblivion over a blatantly obvious joke wallahi,7

In theory, if she saw sunny intention and reacted a bit faster. She would have lived.. . When falling your first instict, its use your fucking hands. . . Dont get me wrong, Mari will live to tell the tale but their siblings relationship will suffer a major hit.. . Mari could tell the others what happened. Sunny could still isolate himself and fully replace her in headspace with basil or someone else.. . In the end, the ending would be either. . a) Moving on and accepting your sibling. . b) Ignore her and her friends, focusing just on yourself,23

Nope, this is the canon ending. Faraway town was just another set of dreams. That’s why the recycultists show up and you see the headspace enemies.,6

ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL ME,6

Would Mari be this forgiving or would she be pissed,1

I’m holding on that headcanon now. Everything after the recital never happened. Mari’s not in the best shape, but she’s okay.,6

Just like >! Mari !<,17
Well that's the point, if only she didn't have a bad knee, if only she would've been just a bit faster, but she did have a bad knee and she was as fast as she was back then.,17

Banging drip, my man.,39
If we counted from the time omori was published to today. Sunny would be around 21 years old now.... . ,36
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUNNY!!! (His watch says 1:43 btw),29
Birth,15
Everyone else trying to look cool for the birthday art, meanwhile Sunny just got back from getting his groceries.,14
>!Sunny looks kinda cute here but QUITE DARK CARRYING ***his dead sister trauma demon hallucination on him as a bag -)-***!<,31
MA BOYYY,9

Snuuy,13
Sunny too chill to be having such a clean look,7
you ever think omocat regrets not having whites in the characters' eyes in-game cause everything she draws nowadays she puts those whites in i swear,7
My wife,6
I know for a fact he did not dress himself like that. Sunny does not know drip. This was all Aubrey’s doing.,11
It’s my boy’s birthday and he’s already rocking an outfit that I definitely need to take notes on.. . ,10

[removed],73
He's such a fancy boy, he's fancy ain't he?,29
I headcanon this as Sunny after he moved away, let’s say 1-2 years after the good ending.,26
I hope he gets better :(,13
Not bald Hero... 🥀,2
Lore Accurately I'm pretty sure he'd be 36 lolz,20
And if we're going chronologically, assuming the game does take place in 2002 (there are a lot of reasons to assume this) he'd be around 39 now.,11
Wow, nice catch! Didn't even notice,1
Give birth. . #NOW,17
[removed],7
\>! Perhaps you shall !< >!spoiler tag it!<,2
>Gameboy he's holding has a black light bulb. . And hector too lol :D,2
>!If I'm right this may be because he moved on from his guilt in the good ending of the game (he gains the whites back when he wakes up from his fight w/ omori)!<,4
real or Mari's >!if she's alive in the universe these drawings take place in!<,5
r/foundvegetableturn,1
1- yes  . 2- yes, OMOcat has been posting the chars in absolute drip on their birthdays on Twitter.,1
damn he is ignoring us fr,43
I counted from the year when the game was published but this sounds even better.,12
[removed],2
right sowwy, still feel silly putting a spoiler on a almost half a decade old game but I understand newcomers come and go (:,3
yup! thanks for pointing that out!,2
no what i'm talking about is the sclera.,2
The drip universe,4
*Headspace* takes place in 199X, which is set 4 years before the real-world section, before the incident. So at the earliest the real world is 1994 and the latest 2003, so he'd be 47 at the oldest or at the youngest he'd be 38.,2
I may be blind, my bad,3

From this point forward I will believe that the size difference in the picture is the accurate size difference between them in the game.,168

Someone will blend a Basil plushie, won't they.,167
Please Omocat I love the plushies but I've already spent $400 on Omori merchh! my wallet is TOAST,26

Probably :),5
No, but I will punt him daily, trying to get higher each time until finally, I can punt him to the moon. . I really want to punt Basil from Omori to the moon,1
Omocat used parasocial relationships! It was supper effective!,34

of course, omocat can’t make a sweetheart plush without making a space bf one,2
,18
aubillions,15
"Im going too aub". . Thats my favorite quote from the game, that scene was so good.,13
That either means aliens are coming to buy auby or all life on earth acquired the need for plushies..,4
I don’t regret anything,1

Auby,2
Don't worry I'm poor, I'll sadly probably only be able to afford 1 ,2

DUDE THATS AMAZING. IM CHANGING MY PFP NOW,154
Killua is reminding me of [this](),69
That last slide, I can't express to you how freaking cool that looks ,42
OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GOOD ?:?:??:? PLEAAAASSSE MAKE MORE ,37
Who takes the place of Omori in this?. . Also cool art!,27
Oh my **god** *thats fucking clean*. . The last slide of enraged gon reminded me of Mob a bit, probably just the eyes and pure black. **I need to see someone draw Mob like this please it fits so well-**,27
The most accurate Omori style ive ever seen,12
Fantastically done,11
First off this is amazing. Second off, you should do a furious killua with the same black eyes and lightning around him that would be so cool! Regardless this is amazing,9
I'VE SEEN THIS ON TIKTOK, INSTAGRAM, TWITTER, AND NOW REDDIT!! got excited to see it again! i love omori and hxh! it looks amazing!,6
"You saw it too, didn't you Gon?". . "A broken Kite.",6
Woahhhh good job i love it! ,3
kurapika without red eyes?,3
Super cool!! Well done!,2
That last side is insane as fuck,2
That’s… crazy! It’s amazing! Good fuckin job!,2
Can we get a mob psycho or jujutsu kaisen one perhaps????,2
Now I need to see Meruem in this style.,2
THIS IS THE CROSSOVER OF MY DREAMS I LOVE YOU,2
Honestly amazing good job,2
oh my god u really nailed the artstyle,2
What is this effect called and how to make it (i mean this kind of movement characters do),2
this is so awesome sauce what,1
The white hair one and the blonde hair one. . ,1
AAAAAA this is perfect!,1
i never watched that but this is absolutelly amazing. gimme ur art skills rn. pls. 😔,1
How do i replace battle portraits to put these in?,1
This is actually amazing. Wow,1
Holy shit this is awesome! Crosses two of my absolute favorite pieces of media so seamlessly! I want more ,1
Damn, you've got it down perfect!,1
i follow you on tiktok!! love these!!❤️❤️,1
Wow! That’s drawn REALLY well. Nice work fellow HxH enjoyer . (Also the fact that gon has a similar look to kel is amazing),1
i wanna ask for dororo but i feel like i shouldnt lol,1
OMG SO GOOD,1
Spectacular,1
Gon is Omori, and Leorio is Hero since he became a Hunter to go to med school. Who would take the place of Aubrey and Kel?,1
I LOVE THIS,1
Haha, it isn’t a spoiler if you’ve never watched it! 😎,1
i saw this on tiktok, you did a great job!!,1
this is.. amazing..,1
AAAHH this is sp fucking cool! Amazing job ,1
As a huge hxh fan and a huge omori fan, this is like the coolest shit I've seen. maybe ever,1
Ayooooooo thats so fuckin cool,1
You should do one for yu yu hakusho if you haven't,1
i cant even begin to tell u how much i love this,1
This is some absurdly high quality content,1
OMGGGGG I LOVE THIS SO SO MUCH PLZ MAKE GODSPEED KILLUA,1
I just recently finished binging HxH 1999 and am about a third through HxH 2011. All these HxH and Omori crossovers really do be hitting at the right time. There was a HxH enemy encounter on this or the Hunter sub too that was really cool.,1
dude this style works so wel, ii love it!!!,1
Two of my greatest loves in one post! This is too perfectttt,1
I just finished watching a Hunter x Hunter type parody thing from Cilvanis and then come on here to find this here. I never seen this show before. I am kind of wanting to watch when get the chance to.,1
Looks incredible!!!,1
You judt convinced me to give hxh a try, good job!,1
DUDE THIS IS SO COOL WTH :O,1
When you find out the three brothers in the hunter exam are called amori, imori, and emori.... . . When you find out that one of Killua's siblings is something ,1
I like this a lot.,1
this is really well drawn!!!,1
I LOVE THIS SM,1
This looks so fucking good. hxh is a very good show, and the characters with the omor art style, but s a recipe for amazing art,1
This is fucking amazing, beautifully done,1
:O how you do that,1
OMG I LOVE THIS!!!!,1
Just imagine kel and gon interacting.,1
Sheeeesh last slide fits the style so good,1
where's meruem bro,1
I would wait until the artist says they’re free use,19
,25
I second this! Id love to see more ♡,15
Probably Gon judging by the last slide,21
yess i would love to do a couple mob portraits when i have a second!,20
i am inside your walls,5
its just frame by frame animation! i drew the same thing 3 times but not perfectly redrawn so it moves a bit,2
No one is going to wait for that though I don’t think. If people want to use this as their profile picture then they will. If the artist truly didn’t want people to use this as their pfps then they would have added a watermark.,8
Sorry I didn't think of that! I just gave credit to the OC in my bio ,2
 \+  = that image,27
Tbh Gon gives Kel vibes. I feel like Killua would be Sunny, Gon would be Kel, and Leorio as Hero. Maybe Kurapika as Aubrey but that feels weird,21
yessssss lets gooo,1
soon I'll be seeing it when i try to sleep,3
to be fair i dont watermark my work because i kinda just always forget to do it, but ive kinda reached a point where i dont care if people use my art for pfps and such...... still the least someone can do is ask before using someones work/credit them :'),11
,10
kurapika as sunny fits more tbh  . Killua would be Aubrey imo,18
gon definitely gives kel vibes,3
Well, may I?,3
Thats fair actually, but who would be 🥯,2
yes!!,9
uh. I'm out of ideas,2
W,4
🤌🤌,964
La speciale Aubrey! :D ,222

I mean, she *does* look like someone I know who is partially italian, so I actually like this headcanon,61
Mama mia my Aubrey is Italian da mia 🤌🤌,102
As an italian i totally approve i welcome her,49
Aubrey mafia boss real,76
La tipica ragazza italiana che ti sfonda a mazzate e prega in chiesa.. . &#x200B;. . But seriously lol, so random. Hero feels more italian if we go by that stereotype.. . &#x200B;. . Not like i would expect much sense from this kind of thread, but oh well.,43
I cooka da meatball,52
Fuck yeah, representation,37
Aubrey in that one fight scene: PERCHE SEI QUI SUNNY STUPIDO MI HAI ABANDONATO! . . sunny: *cries trying to understand*,18
 <PORCO DIO,14
Excuse me why does everyone get an ethnicity and basil just got a skin tone. . Btw i do not accept Aubrey as a part of my country,56
all of the hooligans have new york accents you cant convince me otherwise,11
Auby is Scottish with full accent and nobody can tell me otherwise,27
,7
Why does everyone think she's Italian? Genuine question,7
It's obviously Bri*ish.,6
Eyy Kim, bring me da gabagool.,6
Ravioli Ravioli give me your kidneys,6
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie...,7
I never thought about it but somehow it... just makes sense,5
Perchè?!,6
basil is a femboy, so he is Polish,5
Mama Mia Sunny is that a knife?!,4
This reminds me of a ditty.it video about pasta and pizza in a box. . 🤌🤌,5
The amount of italian people in this thread makes me proud. Btw forza inter,5
Ah, spaghetti,3
È ovvio cioè è una cicamala,3
Is she actually Italian? Or is this just a shit post?,3

No no, the REAL answer: >!she's actually a menace!<,2

that'd explain why she's at Gino's Pizza all the time,2
My proud Italian ass: DAJEEEE E AUBREY UNA DI NOI! UNA DI NOOOOI!. . (Actually, wait a second, that really doesn't sound like an Italian name..),2
kel is Brazilian. Change my mind,2

She just like me, fr fr.,1
Isnt italy fake?,1
Not really obvious for someone who doesnt know what italian people look like (me),1
I have been saying Aubrey is Italian since forever!!! Take my upvotes.,1
Oh come on guys what are you guys think that they are different racist I know Kel and hero are but.,1
Pizza. . &#x200B;. . Pasta. . &#x200B;. . Put it in a box,1
Aubrey’s mom’s light brown hair is more common in peoples whos heritage traces back to Britain, Central Europe and Scandinavia. Aubrey as a name originally derived from Norman (English) heritage, but its so popular that probably doesnt mean much. . . Aubrey’s most defining trait is that she’s extremely pale. Take a look at the other images of her with her friends. She calls Sunny pale, but is even lighter then him in the hugging cut scene. She’s easily the most pale of all characters. But sadly, we dont have enough data yet to make any conclusions about her father from this alone. Black is an extremely common hair color and pale could be any east asian, non-mediterranean european or yes, even Italian (though probably north Italian and not south). . So TLDR: Aubrey heritage is probably half English/Scottish on her Mom’s side and half milk on her father’s side.,1
Italians are white...,1
Nah bro she Aubrey,1
As a Italian I wish there were people like Aubery in here,1
She's a spicy little meatball ,1
me, being part italian:. . hmm. . yes. . good meme. . ,1
Am I the only one who thinks Basil Is british?,1
Wut do u mean, auby is auby it doesn't matter.,1
Ah, so that explains her aggressive nature 👀,1
Silly you! Italians aren’t real, we all know that.,1
omg so cool guys, every women in Italy has a temper, It’s not a joke, it’s genuinely true I know my family does it,1
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie thats omori,1

it's genuinely important to some, but in the US a lot of white people's ethnicity doesn't particularly matter because it's usually pretty mixed between different european and slavic. again especially in the US because it's so separate from the eastern hemisphere (i'm specifying because i'm including all of europe here), people just don't really care about the differences, it's all white/caucasian.,19
God is that you? Forgive me for the countless I have killed whilst wielding my glorious fire axe 🪓,14
Then Aubrey is Vietnamese if you don't want,3
I do not accept you as part of this country either,4
I do, it's my word against yours.,2
Basato,1

I love this idea honestly.,3
As a Scottish person who, naturally, read the whole game in a Scottish accent, I approve,1
I don’t think anyone do. It’s a meme on how people will try to force and then correct interpretation of character, based on over analyzation.. . That being said. We know that Hero and Kel are Latinos because of Ofranda and other elements of their house. . . If you look at how characters are drawn, the eyelashes are the clearest indication of ethnicity. Compare Basil’s eyelashes to Kel and Hero’s and then Mari’s to Aubrey’s. Aubrey is Asian, I believe.,31
Perché no? . . Seriamente, non farti domande sulle cose dei subreddit, se vedi quello di Hollow Knight è una gabbia di matti,3
Or Swedish,2
I think it more like "SUNNY MA N'DOVE HAI PRESO QUEL COLTELLO",5
Atalanta all the way ma rispetto la tua opinione. . Poi, adoro il fatto che Omori abbia successo anche in Italia,3
Penso che sia più una maranza,1
It is headcanon either way,1
I’m pretty sure you're thinking about nationality,9
\-Hero/Kel, Mexican American. -Mari/Sunny, Japanese American. -Basil, I’m split on Slavic or Nordic descent. -Aubrey, Italian American. ,4

It’s hard to guarantee,13
What's the difference,3
I hope sunny claims yet another victim,3
There! Right there!   . Look at that tanned, well tended skin,1
Yes,1
You can say European to describe Basil because blonde hair isn't an American hair color . . If you use "white" it sounds kinda racist,-2

Aubrey is from kel land,2
You can't do that to me. . YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED FOR THIS?,0
Puoi dirlo forte Samir,1
Exactly,2
I'm pretty sure all their eyelashes are drawn the same, it's just that Aubrey and Mari have the little wing on the end (because they're both girls I guess),18
Counter idea: she just like a da pizza pie,1
Vero, sono spesso ad r/hollowknight so che intendi, ma e solo che non ho nessuna idea che la farebbe italiana.. . pero mi piacerebbe tanto che aubrey grande e molto ,2
or slovakian,3
Isn't italian a nationality too though,3
No, Aubrey is only Italian, not American, and Basil is Bri*ish because >!hippity hoppity I stabbed your fucking eye!<,1

Secondo me tutti,5
Non avevo capito che tu non fossi italiano, è davvero un bell'italiano! Comunque, è una citazione ad uno streamer italiano, è normale non capirlo (sarebbe praticamente "the straight peepee"),2
is he gay or European?,14
You'll be here soon,2
I prefer Balkan with some Nordic Features. . so Eastern European,1
White just implies European decent, he's American but so is everyone else so it wouldnt make sense to write 'American' and there's 0 things in the game to point out his heritage so its just a guessing game lol,1
,2
There are differences in level and tilt. Aubrey has far extending lashes and more pronounced lines indicating upper eyelids if you look closely. So does Sunny. Sunny dosen’t have the wing though, Mari does. Basil have different orientation of the lines of the upper eyelid and slightly more highlited line of the eye sockets (I’m not talking about his shadows, if you look at the sprite where his laughing, he has the same lines).,5
Yeah probably, i'm pretty bad at remembering this kinda stuff so you're most likely right,0
Yes but it’s also an ethnicity,1

Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, mamma mia-ma, ma-mamma mia-ah. I feel the heat up, uh, I feel the beat of drums. Call the police, I'll do it, they've stolen all my fun. I'm breaking free, but I'm stuck in a police car. Oh, mamma mia-ma, ma-mamma mia-ah. They treat me like if I did something criminal. All eyes on me, I feel like I'm a superstar. I'm not a freak, I just thought it was carnival. Oh, ma-mamma mia, spit your love on me. I'm on my knees, and I can't wait to drink your rain. I'll keep it secret if you let me get a taste. Tell me your limit, and we'll cross the line again. Oh, mamma-mamma mia, ahahah!. Oh, mamma-mia-ma, ma-mamma mia-ah. You wanna touch my body? I say you're not allowed. You wanna handle me, but I'm a bit too much. I'll burn all the place down, 'cause I'm too fucking hot. Oh, mamma-mia-ma, ma-mamma mia-ah. They wanna arrest me, but I was just having fun. I swear that I'm not drunk, and I'm not taking drugs. They ask me why I'm so hot, 'cause I'm Italiano. Oh, ma-mamma-mia, spit your love on me. I'm on my knees, and I can't wait to drink your rain. I'll keep it secret if you let me get a taste. Tell me your limit, and we'll cross the line again. Oh, mamma-mamma mia. Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask. 'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh". Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask. 'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh". Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask. 'Cause my favorite music's your "Uh, uh". Give me a command, and I'll do what you ask. 'Cause I love when you sing out loud. Oh, mamma-mamma mia, spit your love on me. I'm on my knees, and I can't wait to drink your rain. I'll keep it secret if you let me get a taste. Tell me your limit, and we'll cross the line again. Oh, mamma-mamma mia. Spit your love on me.

In Aubrey's headspace, the land is ruled by Queen Mari, and her brother, prince Sunny. Then, [insert headspace character] kidnaps prince Sunny! So Aubrey must team up with her friend Basil, prince Hero of a neighbor kingdom, and prince Kel. Along the way, she becomes allies with the headspace versions of the Hooligans. Gameplay wise, it would be like Paper Mario 64, with Aubrey's friends being the partners.,28
[Pretty princesses aren't restricted by gender]() when you got someone as cute as Sunny.,5
Huh, I assumed piece of shit,20

There, right there!. Look at that condescending smirk. Seen it on every guy at work,2
That is a metro, hetro jerk!. That guy's not gay i say no way!,2
That is the elephant in the room, Well is it relevant to presume?,2

Ironically chronically,2
Certainly flirtingly,1

Aw :3,5
Aubs!,3
Am i the only one who's missing it? When did Aubrey mansioned she have a crush on Sunny. BTW. Please don't say "headspace" because it's Sunny's ideal world and he wants Aubrey to love him, because you can tell for sure that Sunny have a crush on Aubrey,2
KEL IN THE BACKGROUND I CANNOT-,2
Amazing,1
Hey, it's pretty nice.. . &#x200B;. . ... I wonder why i go check old posts.,1

:D,5

this actually wasnt meant to be a ship-y (?) drawing at first, but people have interpreted it that way which I also don't mind haha. you can also just see it as aubrey being happy a friend surprised her for her birthday :),3
thank you :),35
Can't wait to see what you come up with! Your art is great!,10
Oh the Joy's of my bodys skin cancer prevention system,7
Ohhh i see, really nice drawing btw,3
No problem. Keep up the good work,4

God dammit Kris, where the hell are we?,440
Sunny is taking too long, maybe things took some kind of hikikomori route right now,237
wow… he must be some kind of *hero*,122
I love this new meme, it's God fucking dammit Kris part 2,47
Say that again?,45
Alright, so maybe he's not in the right head space right now...,38
It's like some kind of... HEADSPACE...,19
Like, uh, hey, maybe things took a hikikomori route right now...,16
Wth. . . . I made one just like this 13 hours ago. . I JUST SAW THIS POST NOW😭😭😭,14
This isn't too too much of a stretch.. . There are a lot of similarities of Dark World and Headspace.,13
Susie would NOT know what that word is,11
,9
Pretty rich of a monster to judge someone for not being outside in the sun,10
Okay, where did this meme start? I've seen so many like it and I'm still confused! 😭,4
Really good art! I had a lot of ideas for Susie and Kris in Faraway, but I sadly cannot draw...,4
Human… I remember you’re PIZZA DELIVERY,3
Sunny was just in the darkworld for 4 years,3
KRIS DO NOT CREATE A DARK FOUNTAIN IN THAT HOUSE,3
“Damn Kris, this dark world’s got too much space, it’s making my head spin”. . The Piano downstairs named Omori:,3
Man, this house is kinda sus,2
Bro is. . . . to get out of his house,2
Turns out Headspace was a Dark World this whole time,2
Both Kris and Sunny carry a knife around and have been somewhat isolated from friends since something terrible happened years ago….,2
Can’t wait for the part where we find out that >!Kris pushed Dess into the bunker and they both play they’re version of final duet on piano and guitar.!<,2
SOMETHING SOMETHING faraway,1
:O,1
THOSE SPRITES ARE SO CUTTTEEEE,1
,621
Sunny is.... What did you say?,90
SUNNY TOO BRIGHT,16
*sandwich*,46
that again?,23
Maybe he's in some king of ... black space?,6
It's Deltarune so they take sunlight.,12
in deltarune chapter 4 >!if you play through it on the weird route, Susie says “like, uh, hey, maybe things took a weird route right now” and it became a meme!<,16
Imagine if at the end of a neutral run in Omori, Sunny accidentally created a dark fountain,183
love how ðis implies ðe headspace gang are darkners,3
The fandoms come together 🔥🔥,2
LOL,2
,110
she must be some sort of aubergine,23
i read it in heavy's voice,2
So there's two memes here? I was more thinking about those, "This truly was our Hikikomori" memes. Those type.,3
Sunny creating a dark fountain in his own chest,117
headspace itself is like a dark world, just missing the fountain. . tho it's like if you created a dark world in sunny's mind, instead of his house (and well, no dark fountain),26
Sounds like an interesting fanfic idea,10
>!hit the ground too hard!<,5
YOUR             LONG,36
mama mia agoiliodfeiksdfgvfhdserikfreujfk,3
he must be some king of *basil*,10
. . Litterally this (artist @ghostopal\ from Twitter btw),135
So, >!Headspace?!<,29
I've literally been unable to get the thought of a platonic Kris / Sunny crossfic with the premise of "Sunny opens a Dark Fountain in front of Kris to try to bring Kris into HEADSPACE as a bid to be understood" out of my mind for the past several days how on Earth do I suddenly see this so similar idea in the wild,14
YOUR TAKING TOO TOO,21
you like to garden? do you grow any \*basil\*?,9
. . Reminded me of this,17
looks like he's having a stroke or a seizure, someone should call the cops,29
Hold on, this prompt is peak!,2
YOUR TOO TOO,20
wow! it sure is cloudy... almost as if things have taken some sort of *aborted sunny route*...,10
Kris is they/them,48
ummm they're like playing some sort of music that they made for police alarm,3
My lord, have mercy and please write this humble form of text,2
"Your taking too long" IS TAKING TOO LONG,13
YOUR TOO TOO IS TOO LONG,5
Looks like things have taken a *bad route*…,3

Does that mean Miku is blonde in real life?,162
Basil in Mikuland,49
Thanks for the drawing idea,41
Absolutely valid. . I can imagine Miku being Basil's role model ,39
Either basil is a vocaloid or miku is alive and real,12
How much do they know about the game?,8
lowkey they do, and also they both have blue hair,16
bad idea, >!we all know what basil did with sunny’s big sister!<,20
basil = mikuo realisation,5
Don't you know what this implies about Miku?! ,5
i have a basil pop-up figure coming in the mail soon!!!,4
I mean, they kinda do,3
yes!!!. . I've always seen Bridget Guilty Gear as my big sister, but i would be honored to have miss Miku as my sister too ><,3
basil has schizophrenia,3
Omg we have the same miku figure,3
i can see the resemblance,2

God they're so cute, I love them. . This community is filled to the brim with such talented artists, and it's wholesome. So far I've seen zero toxicity from it. I'm so happy.,114
Tofu. . . . . . Tofu is what's cookin',37
Absolutely beatifull.,32
Can you smell what the Hero is cooking . . It looks pretty damn good,23
this is so cute!,37
i love this,15
To think he learned all that in a cookbook...,16
this is so well done holycowwww,16

tofes,6
HOLY- that art looks great!,7
This is actually perfect. Smug Mari and blushing hero and the sprout mole apron!,6
AWWWW,4
Alternatively,  . . Mari: "What's lookin, good cookin'?". . Hero: "At you, my dear." >!But would Hero be that smooth? Of course, he could say it in another way as well.!<,4
Why is Hero making so much soft cardboard?,4
Ayo the pizza here!,2
Yo chill,84
Fortune Teller Hero AU,44
SOMETHING sways in the wind,3

**so well done holycowwww, this is.** . . *-Skyend*. . ***. . . . ^(Commands: 'opt out', 'delete'),-8
Omg yes I can completely envision that! 10/10 would buy for some tofu salads,8
If this quote is from the skit I'm thinking of, I feel very sorry for what's about to happen to Mari.,5
Thank you for such a kind comment! It makes me so happy to have all the details noticed <3,3
Also is it just me or does Mari look like commiting lenny face,2
Have you seen my post?! (im not sure one of my paintings are toxic),5

You got me haha,5
in the headspace sprite when she says it she looks like that,2
wow, i absolutely ADORE your art style and the way you draw Sweetheart especially <33,161
Ater taking their food, she’s just going to run away and laugh like an obnoxious person. That reminds me of a meme where a guy went to a supermarket and said that he’d pay for everything that the ppl inside the sm would buy. Then he left.,85
this is so real it could be omori's spoiler,51
BEEN A FAN SINCE 53 SUBS NOTICE ME SWEETHEART,42
Sweetheart commits cannibalism confirmed.,19
That's so on character. Nice art btw.,14
is she EATING DONUTS? isnt that CANNIBALLISM? LMAO,9
Nobody gonna talk about how Sweetheart's a donut and she's eating DONUTS?,6
I love the artstyle as well,3
how to draw,2
I THOUGHT IT WAS REAL,2
Cannibalism,2
i love rosscreations,1
ROCOCO is FURIOUS,1
T-THANK YOU!! 💞🤧,56
PFFFFT Yeah honestly XD,16
YES PLEASE SWEETHEART MY BELOVED 💖🙌,22
Thank you sm!! ><✨,6
Well, she’s kind of a Donut-human hybrid, so I don’t think so.,5
Thank you!!! ✨🥺,2
HUH??? 😭,1
agreed with them!,12
YOU BETTER NOT BE COMPETITION. . SWEETHEARTS HEART IS MINE. . ..she just doesn’t know it yet . . STILL,17
Bullshit. Her pet name isn't Sweet Jelly Filled Donut-Human Hybrid,6
YOUR ART IS JUST THAT GOOD,2
Being a Sweetheart simp is a full time job and I’m dedicated 🍩🛐,13
Well then how do you explain her being humanoid while her parents very clearly look like (mostly) normal donuts?,2
I- HDJDGSGFHDHDK ✨🤧😭,1
IM MORE DEDICATED. . I PAYED MY ENTIRE COLLEGE TUTION FOR SEATS TO THE FINALE OF SWEETHEARTS QUEST FOR HEARTS,11
Genetic variation/mutation. If my parents were normal humans and I was born without any arms or legs, eating humans would still be cannibalism because it's not like I'm a different species all of a sudden.. . Mentioning that her parents are donuts only reinforces the notion that she is donut.,1
Hey, it’s the IRS,5
Okay, then she’s the only “Donut” that doesn’t look at all like a donut (aside from the visible hole that goes through her stomach),2
We’ve got two full-power Sweetheart simps here, what do we do?,8
AND MY TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR THOSE TICKETS,6
JOIN THE FANCLUB,9
You’re going to jail for quite a bit of time. And like, actual jail.,6
NO,3
SHUT UP SIMP,2
HUH?. . BUT SWEETHEART IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING,2
Perhaps in your fantasy, but this ain’t fantasy. Or at least some measure of not fantasy.,2
WELL I DIDNT WANT IT TO END THIS WAY BUT. . currently strapped to my chest is 60 kilos of explosives packed next to shrapnel and broken glass, I have a kill switch that only I can disarm . . . now back the fuck off slowly and I’ll let everyone here live,1
WOAH FUCK UHHH OK SIR (what do I do oh god oh fuck),1
By the fact she has a bad knee In dream space to keep her out of adventures, It's a little scary,270
I like to think there are thousands of Headspace Maris throughout Headspace that communicate together as a hivemind.,88
I’d like to think she knows instant transmission,116
I want her to know she can get on a bike and do what she wants to do as long as she is safe,35
I hate how people say in the dream that her knee hurts and she’s scared of adventure.,43
lol, yeah. Like how does she get around so fast?,20
got that minecraft run and jump strategy,21
she is dream speedrunner confirmed canon!1??1!1?1!?1?1?1??1?1! 😳😳😳,26

Nah she just teleports,1
why did i laugh at this so much 🤣,1
does she teleport or something, ive always wondered tbh,1
Headcanon that there are multiple Maris in Headspace.,1
,1
Yes ,. It's a bit scary to keep away from adventure,53
Mari hivemind. . Mari hivemind,40
Like in Pokémon with the Nurse Joys (except with a hivemind),16
expand your mind, omori!,7
>!considering there's multiple something like Dorothy in the train, this seems possible!<,5
But can she beat Goku?,35
Mari movin like Sans,66
yeah when I was playing I just assumed she could teleport because there's no way she climbed that ladder to Otherworld in between talking to Omori 💀,19
>! To be fair Omori created that situation just to protect Mari from going on adventures and possibly dying again just like how she died irl as stated in the true route !<,115
**That's** the reason why her knee hurts.,24
One in one trillion chance of >!breaking your neck as you fall!<,26
Sorry, I don't support this post type (hosted:video) right now.  Feel free to check back in the future!,2
DUDU Du Du,9
Spoiler didn't work,8
incase you’re wondering this has been posted in the past like 90 days or so,2
She looks so hurt by that question.,381
i wouldn't be surprised if this actually happened,209
MARI is AFRAID,135
Announcer: "Up next is Mari playing the piano with her brother Sunny playing... \*covers mic and looks at assistant\* is this a typo?",112
Final duet but Sunny plays a fucking jar of mayo,94
it's percussion, right?,68
one of the greatest tragedies of our time,33
hloy shid spongboon an patridge dead,32
aw hell na,20
I like how Mari looks like she just woke up when Sunny asked that question.,19
[removed],17
Sunny just wanting knowledge. Complete WHOLESOME 100 moment. Take a wholesome :-).,14
how was this colored im confused,12
Since this meme has Kel, does it mean that it's also...?,11
She's so disturbed by it lmfao,7
Omari AU,5
Imagine all the Violin images replaced by Sunny trying to play Mayonnaise,6
Omg so wholesome and cute,5
Mewo-naise,3
comment to save this cause lmao,3
Oh so that’s why they argued on the stairs,1
The true reason of the argument,1
they watchin spongebob,1
Sunny: why do you look like that sis?. . Mari <----- totally not thinking about the sus ver of milk: it's nothing-,1
I mean as an avid pianist and musician it would hurt,195
i hc Sunny mimics Kel. A lot.,167
MARI is STRESSED OUT,94
Let him play his mayo u cowards!!😌😌,42
Hey, mark spoilers for the Ultra Secret Pacifist True Good Ending™️,33
Fuck it, Final duet played with Armpit,46
eat your mayo and come back stronger,24
Lmao,17
Aw hel na paunch slob did 9/11,6
gratitude,7
color pencils,12
all Kel memes are...,12
also given the fact that it's sunny asking he's dead serious when he asks that, it's not even a joke,145
>! More than falling down the stairs? !<,12
to be fair, given Sunny's personality I'd imagine he respects Kel's bluntness and honesty. Since he himself is reserved and internalizes a lot, he probably really appreciated Kel's openness. . he basically says as much on the last night if you examine the friends at basil's house,130
YES, THAT'S FLNWF- yes.,30
Mari: \*plays the beautiful opening notes of final duet\*. . Sunny: \*shlop shlop splat\*,44
It's only a spoiler if you say it is.. . There was absolutely no spoiler there until you said that.,12
CANON!,12
Yep that’s what actually happened,1
a perfect combo,66
Makes me wish that sunny was kel was his bestfriend (no offence for our flower boi),15
Talented, incredible, beautiful, never the same 🥺🥺🎶🎶💕💕,29
I was making a joke; as far as I know, there isn't an ending where Sunny and Mari make it to the recital and Sunny plays mayonnaise,7
i bet if kel hadn't gotten bored of the flower crowns and left, sunny probably would have been too nervous to leave on his own, probably thought he'd hurt someone's feelings even though nobody actually would think that,65
i mean they're all best friends. kel even says as much on the last day to aubrey,16
I mean it's still a spoiler now but alright,3
The more I think about this-. . . . . **The more I fucking love those two**,26
How? It literally isn't a real ending,2
Yeah you changed it to be more sarcastic but it was a spoiler since there IS an ending where Sunny and "Mari" play the final duet.,3
I mean I just added adjectives,3
There was also a thing called >!black space, where you, AUBREY and HERO bashed in BASIL's fucking head. !<,387
>!Then you helped to stun Basil and Aubrey bashed his skull with a bat.!<,290
: you're going places, SUNNY. One of them being therapy.,234
: You could break massive blocks of raw iron with your bat and headbutt (literally) the entire world.. . : Neat!. . : I also had a harem of you fighting clones of yourself in an Aubrey harem in an alternative timeline or possibly in the past many headspace resets ago.. . : ...S-sunny this isn't Undertale....WAIT DID YOU SAID YOU HAD A HAREM OF ME?!,126
: Then he turned into a melon. Funniest shit I've ever seen.. . :,120
i love the idea of sunny just sharing his headspace dreams with his friends,96
Curious actually, does using more than 1 coffee on Kel do any significant changes?,33
omori power scaling be like:,26
The legend of Kel. . Every Kel meme is canon,9
After a week of of grinding in his continual RPG dreams, Sunny is excited to tell Kel he figured out how to break the dream and get Kel to throw chicken nuggets past the speed of sound.,12
The way I deadass did this during the Pluto/earth fight. I use kel as a support unit but had heard about nuke kel and was like, "this seems like a good time to try it out". I sat there in shock from his 5000 dmg with a last minute scrapped together setup,9
This is so  and ,2
THIS IDEA IS SO CUTE,2
:kel why do you have coffee, I thought you didn’t drink that… why are you getting closer…,1
Heh… try two,1
 Pogchamp, SUNNY!,231
: f\*ck,118
: I said what I said. . :. . : Ayo nice,75
Aubery: sunny……are you…..saying you have a crush on me? . . Sunny:ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm,29
>also had a harem of you fighting clones of yourself in an Aubrey. . wait what.,6
>!smashy smash smash basil!<,34
I love watermelons! Yummy goes into tummy,10
Yes, his speed increases every time you use a coffee,28
His speed increases with each coffee, making Run 'n' Gun incredibly strong.,13
KEL, what the actual fuck is wrong with you? ,136
: HOLD THE ARMS THAT I HOLD THE LEGS KEL,91
: yro’ue mother,31
I have 2 images going on in my mind and none of them are good.,12
Ohhhh ok thanks,9
Ahh I see thanks,2
>!And then, BASIL turned into a fucking watermelon!< ,171
🤝🏻🤝🏽. . (They are dragging Sunny to therapy),94
The funniest shit i have seen in my life,113
I want to be a watermelon too ,15
nom nom, BASIL! ,3
I don't think sunny would fight it tbh,59
so yunno how all the items were like?,21
,11
believe me you wont like it at all,9
 \[law and order special victims unit\],2
Nah he ain't fighting he just likes the feeling of being carried around by his friend that cares about him and the tomboy delinquent that cares about him.. . Also he couldn't fight them even if he wanted to.,56
oh yeah and I was poking around and realized a surprising amount of people flush down their noodles,19
Do you think sunny still crushes on aubrey or not kinda off topic but yk I sorta wonder,23
I use them to repair the toilet thought,6
i feel like this meme is honestly a lot more true than most people would think. spoilers for content in the alternate route ahead!. . >!i see the BS2 school scene with the aubrey harem as a manifestation of sunny's commitment issues. he clearly feels strongly for her, yet he fears actually being in a relationship and having to commit to everything that entails. this could also be due to committing to the recital with mari; with how bad that went, it's possible that he's afraid of making any more committments and them resulting in yet another horrible accident.!<. . edit: [ended up  writing out a larger post abt this if any of you are interested!](),398

aubrey: ***aggressive flirting***,146
I wanna make a comic of this.,60
Strangely relatable.,118
I specifically opened reddit for sunburn content, thank you,33
*gets scared* can be replaced with *stabs*,26
*Everything is going to be okay*,17
"hey, wAnNa dAtE?1??",16
Dang.... Guess Aubrey got rejected,11
I see a bit of myself here and I don’t like it,5
Sunny you lucky bastard :),3
I am a simple man I see sunburn I upvote,3
Spoiler tag please,5
[removed],99
na most likely occam's razor. sunny likes aubrey and imagines being a harem with her but too much of a coward to ask her out in real life.,20
[removed],2
Every encounter is a struggle between saying "Hi" and "Step on me" each time she starts talking,138
I am sure that after calming down, Sunny would ask politely for Aubrey to step on him.,106
Aubrey's way too emotionally fucked up for aggressive flirting. Awkwardly trying to convey her care like a dork is more her game.,15
I want to see that comic,35
Sure, go ahead,31
Strangely relatable as well.,64
I didn't expect to get called out like this,11
perhaps a bit, but i don't think committment issues are that uncommon. . as long as you do your best to try and get over those issues i think all is good. it's scary, but sometimes we gotta leave our comfort zones. i believe in you!,85
If you fear committmeants for the same reason sunny do, probabilly yes,7
[removed],97
[removed],40
Sunny barely spoke in 4 years. . Must be quite a shock for one of his first  words to be "step on me",101
everyone deserves some words of kindness, and sometimes it helps the most to hear it from complete strangers haha,41
Turns out he just didn't speak much because he was hiding his power level from everyone.,53
If he speaks he literaly exposes all his kinks he gained from surfing on the internet for 4 years non-stop,72
[deleted],33
don't,24
>!Wait really? I thought Abby was a imaginary friend he made-up as a child- If abby does represent Sunny's lewd side...Oh boy Aubrey would be surprised- !<,21

>aubrey is a girl kisser. . damn she's just like me fr,94
That doesnt look like Aubrey in the 1st pic. The hair is much shorter than Aubrey's, also it seems a little wavy. The girls are both wearing japanese uniform, as well as the other girl does not look like any omori character. So in conclusion the only thing that makes it look like Aubrey is the ribbon. Omocat's artstyle makes many characters look similar, so I wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt Aubrey. Id be cool to have comfirmation though,64
My bi queen,24
So freinds can't have pictures of each other?,58
[removed],8
between basil, aubrey and charleen (off the top of my head), omocat really likes her queer subtext that isn't even remotely subtle but still just unclear enough that fans get annoyed if you treat it as fact. . way i see it, anyone that thinks this is tumblr-level reaching is forgetting that omocat is the author of stuff like Pretty Boy and therefore just as tumblr-brained as the rest of us. it's AT LEAST intended as a possible interpretation,7
I only see one girls kissing photo on there ,14
holy shit this comment section, if fucking knew it will be very Controversial,8
*cease*,31
She's but don't let this distract you from the fact that Aubrey canonically hates orange joe. ,6
Shippers when they forget that strong platonic relationships exist,45

How can Aubrey be this gay and yet be so homophobic,5
Girl liker ,5
top left isn't aubrey tho,39
porque no los dos?,9
The first pic is not Aubrey though. Look at the date,9
I swear anyone in omori is shown to be a close friend of someone it's instantly interpreted as dating. Like it's never platonic,29
That isn't Aubrey in the top picture. that's one of omocats other OCs.,18
And homophobic,8
ohh so when aubrey does it she's 'gay' but when basil and sunny do it they're just 'best friends',9
The first artwork of the two girls kissing isn't supposed to be Aubrey iirc, even if the chara design is pretty similar,4
I guess Aubrey is a Bi queen,3
I’m still a sunburner, but then again I’m also a polyamorous mother fucker. So any ship is ok to me as long as it ain’t familial. Fuck anyone whoever’s into familial ships, get therapy.,4
Daily reminder that you are wrong,13
Aubrey and Kim are only friends, she and her are close friends although made by fans, Aubrey moves with Sunny to support him, Kim and Basil becomes close.,10
Sunburn fans: imma pretend I didn't see that,6
Sunburn and Kimsil are the best ships aside from Heromari. Fight me. (Don’t actually fight me. I have neither the time nor the energy and I will literally just ignore you even if you try to start a ship war here.),27
aubrey in the image where she's holding kim looks cold af 🥶,3
. . I did it I have become super shipper. . Omocat thanks for the power!,3
It ain’t gay to kiss the homies,3
I’m all for gay Aubrey but could someone link that sketch bc I’m too lazy to go look for it myself,3
The one on the top left just looks like a girl with a ribbon and is likely was made before aubrey was even a thought omocat had, and most of this art doesn't really say anything. Platonic relationships do exist ya know? Idk why best friends always equals to gayness.,3
People have a problem with this? It’s kinda like how Basil appears to have queerness to him but no one really getting shocked about that.,3
As a sunburn enjoyer. I honestly don’t care.,3
you like kissing girls don't you,3
My hc is that she's bi with a female lean,3
"that just aint right" 🐕,3
That’s not canon though.,18
She is literally me!,5
Still doesn’t disprove the swingset scene.,4
I definitely headcanon as her being a girl kisser. Her and Kim are super cute and my favorite Auby ship. And yes the art of her kissing another girl isn't confirmed her, its like cmon if we can make insane assumptions for ships like sunburn (I'm looking at you people who say Aubrey looking at Sunny in the hangout moment and people saying Aubrey's bed being the same in headspace as real life is sunburn evidence), then we can sure as hell say its probably Aubrey,8
I know who I am,2
"I know what you are.",2
Do you know who you are?. . When you words.... . DONT, SOUND, LIKE *YOUR OWN*?,2
omg she's just like me :0,2
Y'know, I always sort of thought that Kim x Aubrey was a cute ship :). . (Also side note: I really love that marker piece by Omocat it's so visually pleasing <3),2

cool so now my ships are. sunny x basil. aubrey x kim x kel polycule. hero x mari. The Maverick x The Left Hand,2

Why am I just finding out Kim is a girl...,2
bi aubrey. . bi aubrey. . bi aubrey. . bottom text,2
I KISS A GIRL AND SOCIETY.. SOCIETY CALLS ME GAY,2
This is just my two cents, and you are 100% allowed to have your own headcanon and I respect that . . Apart from the top left one, none of these necessarily screams “relationship” to me. I mean I have pics of my friends in my bedroom, doesn’t mean I’m dating them lol. And to me the bottom left one just kinda seems like them hanging out. Top right one does raise an eyebrow I guess, but idk, once again doesn’t necessarily scream relationship to me.. . Returning to that top left one, well one it’s a really neat drawing, but I have no idea who the girls in it are, and 2014 was super early in development anyway. Unless the art is official OMORI art I don’t think it demonstrates anything other than that omocats incredible art skills.. . I’ve always been kinda curious about this ship because actually in game we don’t actually see Aubrey and Kim like have actually interactions that much. Like obviously the game makes it very clear that they are best friends, and that Kim is trying to fill the void left after the incident, but in terms of actual dialogue and interactions, there ain’t that much to base what the dynamic of these two even would be. Idk, I guess it’s just one of those things I don’t get.. . Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, enjoy your headcanon, friend,2
WHY DID YOU CLICK ON THIS POST?    . DID YOU WANT TO SEE GIRLS KISSING?    . YOU LIKE GIRLS.    . YOU LIKE KISSING.    . YOU LIKE GIRLS KISSING!,2

She is a HOMO,1
What does girl kisser mean?. . Is it just lesbian?,1
Well the first one is an unidentified girl that never appears in the final story(2014) so it's not canon, for the others I think it's just Omocat trying to make that "best friends" type of relationship, there is no clue for  them being togheter, even the fact that Aubrey might be lesbian or bisexual... isn't it a bit weird to assume that she would go around and kiss every girl that gets close to her? It's like if she was shown kissing a boy  it would mean she would also kiss Sunny, I am pretty sure people would've instead assume it ruins the ship,1
Why do gay people insist on making children that have not been shown to be gay, gay? It’s gross,1

Yeah because it’s literally two completely different girls, neither of which are Aubrey or Kim lmao. . Omocat just has one of those art styles where it’s hard to tell the difference between characters with similar characteristics. But the other doesn’t even look **remotely** like kim in any way so using it for this ship is just goofy,62
Yeah, it's because these are OMOCAT's OC'S ,6

look at the girl on the right. ribbon, long hair, exact same jacket... it's definitely her.,19
Its not confirmed but it looks a bit too much like Aubrey to say its not,2
good question actually,2
well, the first omori trailer was released in april 2014, so that art piece actually came out after it. ps: (never noticed it, but the marker piece was posted on my birthday! cool coincidence),1
i personally don't frame a photo of me and my bestie in my room and princess carry her, but whatever floats your boat!,-15
is it? doesn't look like any of them. are you saying that because you think it's not aubrey, or because it's definitely one of them? just to make it clear.,6

fuckin true,3
 there you go,2
the first omori trailer predates the top left one by months. yes, there IS a possibility they're gal pals and aubrey just happens to kiss girls as well, but it's just unlikely.,4
,2
Nor is Sunburn, Sunflower, Cactiflower, Photobomb, Baseball Bat or Suntan. What's your point?. . Only HeroMari is canon, and their relationship wasn't too much explored because of *obvious* reasons.. . Being canon or not, just let people ship who they want to.. . Except ships that has a *very questionable* morale, like ships with Mari and Hero that aren't HeroMari.,32
Its not. But none of the ships are canon so its as canon as the others.,9
and that statement is based on what? they're all made by omocat, so why wouldn't they be? i believe in canon until proven otherwise, personally.,8
No shit,1

Remember: for shipping purposes, unless someone has their sexuality explicitly stated, every fictional character is bi,282
**[Bisexuality]()** .  .  >Bisexuality is a romantic or sexual attraction or behavior toward both males and females, or to more than one gender. It may also be defined to include romantic or sexual attraction to people regardless of their sex or gender identity, which is also known as pansexuality. The term bisexuality is mainly used in the context of human attraction to denote romantic or sexual feelings toward both men and women, and the concept is one of the three main classifications of sexual orientation along with heterosexuality and homosexuality, all of which exist on the heterosexual–homosexual continuum..  . ^([ )[^(F.A.Q)]()^( | )[^(Opt Out)]()^( | )[^(Opt Out Of Subreddit)]()^( | )[^(GitHub)]()^( ] Downvote to remove | v1.5),70

Well yea, we play OMORI,1
it could be like early design Aubrey,-5
It isn't in the game though?,23
1. That isn’t any know character in said photo. 2. It’s hard to tell if that’s even auby,6
No its not especially someone that comes from a broken home like Aubrey. She and Kim are close no denying that but that doesn't mean they are in a relationship when the game shows zero evidence for it except for a picture that can be seen any way.,45
…in what way is this odd? ppl have pics of them and a friend (both same and opposite genders) in their room or as a lock screen/wallpaper all the time. and 4 years is more than enough time to grow close to someone, but like what does that even have to do w anything? my closest friend has known me for a shorter amount of time than most of my other friends. . . sometimes you just click w a specific friend more than others, time doesn’t play a factor in that. you don’t need to be childhood besties w a person to have pics of them in your room. . . honestly aubrey and kim might have something going on between them who knows, but i disagree that it’s “odd” to have a framed pic of you and a friend who you only see in a platonic way since like i said before it’s pretty common.,13
Reddit moment,7
Ahh yes you got me. My ploy has been revealed. I'm a the president of it too! . . Edit: Context the person called me homophobic so I was answering them sarcastically.,11
i get some strong semi-closeted trans girl vibes from her, with the way she's shy about doing more feminine stuff she likes and the fact that her name is something of a secret between her family and close friends. reads like a kid at the stage of transition where shes comfortable opening up to people she trusts but not quite enough to go public with it,4
This fandom forgets about bi & pan ppl exist, so im not even even surprised they only know lesbian,gay,and straight and they got triggered about this,3
fuckin true though. I have never seen someone say this about ANY straight ship,4
the jacket is not the exact same. There's nothing on the back,16
It's more plausible that this character is some Omocat self insert or another OC. The only thing it has in common with Aubrey is the handkerchief bow, the clothes and even the size of her hair is different. But Omocat usually draws herself as having that kind of bow as well (just see Artist, her self insert in the game) so...,13
Still 6 years before the release of the game. That character could have been scrapped, and her design later inspiring Aubrey's.. . It's like the Persona 5 fans thinking Hifumi was gonna be a PT.,5
So like not to encourage any particular ship but princess carrying is pretty common. At least among stupid teenage boys, we did that shit all the time. I cannot recall why, maybe it was funny or a show of strength. Both of these things can be pretty platonic or romantic.,27
what world are you from where getting carried by your friend is considered romantic. like i think there are romantic undertones, but cmon man.,7
Yeah, you "personally" don't, but others do. Unless it's confirmed by Omocat, you can just speculate and have fantasies about it.,17
The princess carry one was a fan art right?. And yes,it is normal to have a picture of you and your bff framed,8
I've heard it from multiple people, idk. That picture kinda blew up on TikTok a while back. Everyone seemed to be in agreement that it isn't Aubrey, due to the hair color change, ribbon color change, completely different clothes, and completely unknown character "Aubrey" is kissing. People think omocats just drew a character using the cute ribbon they gave Aubrey, cause honestly that's the only thing that is making her seem like Aubrey. I should've clarified that, my bad. If omocat clarified it, cool.,19
that's what i like to see,2
If the girl on the first drawing is confirmed to be Aubrey then ok, 'til then we can't affirm that anything's canon,2
I sunk it,1
Don't touch My Wordl,1
and it's kim running basil over with her scooter several times,11
I just have a feeling they’d get along well after the finale (if Sunny and Basil’s friends forgive them, that is). . Also, ships don’t have to have canon basis. As long as it fits the personalities of the characters it’s a working ship.,2
thanks very helpful,2
i knew it ur a girlkisser,1
No, shipping is dumb. But stuff openly hinted at by the game and creator isn't shipping. It's literal game content.,2
There is literally no proof for canon so why would you state it as canon?. There is no need to prove otherwise since it wasn't canon in the first place,10
All I’m saying is that Hero x Mari is the only canon ship, we’re all allowed to interpret the other’s relationships differently.,3

Good bot,26
And this is woooosh... how?,9
iirc there was also a man Aubry option at one point,9
Well choosing Sunny's gender also determines Kel's and Aubrey's gender. If Sunny is female, then Kel is also female and Aubrey is male. Others are unaffected I believe,6
Aubrey doesn't care about gender, she cares about the Snuuy. And Snuuy transcends all genders.,22

You say it’s obviously a joke but how are they joking when they keep arguing that it’s actually Aubrey? Have you even seen how OP has talked about it?. . No joke is ever obvious on the internet unless OP specifically says whether that was their intention to be a joke or not.,12
Early design Aubrey looks completely differently,1
When the creator draws it I think you’re aloud to make some assumptions,29
let me guess. you don't use that same logic for heterosexual ships, do you?,-38
you cant be the president of homophobia, you’re little reddit guy is pride colored >!/j!<,3
HAH I FOUND YOU . I been looking for you for millenia. . You killed Polytetraflouroethylene the God of Boy Kisser. . How dare you! He was the only god I trusted! . . HAKAI!!,1
ohh yeah true,3
Now, I know this is hard to understand for redditors, especially for those obsessed with Hikkikomoris, but most people actually do what's called "changing clothes" where they remove what they're wearing, and put on something entirely different. This is often done after a procedure called a "shower" but I won't overwhelm you with too much explaining all at once.,69
i beg to differ. also, since the post was made in 2014, it's very much plausible that such a small detail, like the back of her jacket might've changed in development.. . ,17
yeah, it's always a possibility. but considering all the everything else, it's more likely to be romantic.,-8
perosonally isn't a word?,-7
> The princess carry one was a fan art right? . . nope, official 2014 artwork posted by the official omori game account.. . [,0
well, she's wearing a bomber jacket, has the same haircut, and same ribbon. the color change is just an artistic choice, see: the limited color palette.  it just seems like misinformation. not trying to be snarky, just, check you sources next time.,3
I mean, it would be weird for Omocat to draw a girl in Aubrey’s outfit with Aubrey’s hair ribbon and not have it be Aubrey.,1
Fr,8
I see your point but i personally do not think their personalities match that well,3
but the content being shown here is outside the game?,4
again, what's the proof it isn't?,5

personal experience, as i've been friends with some straight girls. almost all the straight girls i've seen kiss other girls have turned out bisexual, or any other sexuality attracted to multiple genders.,9

Come on you can't tell me your straight. Straight people aren't real hehehe .. Eh straight people aren't real ... Right? They're just a horror story right?. (Visibly terrified),11
oh damn you need some aloe vera,2
Yeah now that I saw them say it they may not be. But I also realized it could actually still be early design aubrey, we don’t know.,-1
Someone else said it in this post, but the girl Aubrey's kissing is very likely the original female Sunny design. At this point in the game's development when Omocat drew the art (2014), you could choose whether Sunny would have been either male or female. Pretty neat that Aubrey would have remained Sunny's crush whether he was male or female!,60
I said no evidence for them being in a relationship not her sexuality.,34
THERE ARE ONLY 3 CANON SHIPS IN THE GAME, AUBREY IS IN NONE OF THEM,6
please explain to me what a shower is? it sounds quite frightening,7
Characters in omori tend to not change clothes much,-7
another picture of the back of her jacket.. . ,18
To use your own reasoning against your point: since the post was made in 2014,  it's very much plausible that such a small detail, like her orientation might've changed in development.. . Not that I care either way. This post just seems like it's reaching.,14
no I'm pretty sure that this is just another OC. I don't know about you but the ribbon here is pink and Aubrey was shown in art with a blue ribbon before this released,17
typos exist.,21
Cool,5
What sources?. Where is any of this confirmed? Btw the jacket is clearly not the same. As you can see, it has short sleeves unlike Aubrey's jacket where the sleeves are just folded. Also the back of the jacket is exactly the same as in a Japanese school uniform what the left girl is wearing. So in conclusion, they're both wearing Japanese school uniforms and the only thing connecting Aubrey and the right girl is the ribbon, which is just a stupid reason to connect those two. Even the hairstyle isn't matching up since Aubrey's hair is completely straight and the girl in the picture has wavy hair. And the left girl isn't even familiar with us which indicates that this is just a normal art piece Omocat decided to share with us. And don't try to keep proving your point please, it has been proven false quite a while ago already. And these facts I stated here just prove it false even more,8
I thought the drawing was older than 2014 so yeah you're right,2
Nah the jacket is way different, in fact it's a Japanese school uniform,2
That’s fair,2
i mean… it’s literally not in the game or really hinted at all in the game. other than heromari and childhood (one-sided) sunburn, there are no other ships hinted at or otherwise in the game.,9
Any positive assertion must be backed up by proof. . . For example, saying "unicorns exist" isn’t as true as saying "unicorns do not exist". The burden of proof falls on you to prove that they do exist. In this case, it is normal to assume it’s not canon because it was never claimed by Omocat to be canon. In this case, you would have to prove that Omocat did, in fact, declare this as canon.,9
But why they trash,2
Because they are gay ships? Lmao,1
In my experience girls kiss other girls to expirement because they’re at an experimental age. That doesn’t mean that they’re gay as long as they don’t have a gay intention behind it.,-6
pan technically falls under the bi umbrella so i dont blame you. . . &#x200B;. . bi is being attracted to more than one gender and pan is liking all genders with no preference,79
I think Bi is in attracted to all genders and Pan is I don’t care about your body or gender. Essentially they are the same thing and micro labels are confusing but we gotta respect them,14
There isn't one.,2
[removed],2
Holy shit is that Eric cart man sans,1
,2
,21
It could also (much more likely) be omocat’s oc or self insert since she drew herself looking very similar to Aubrey in the past before Omori was finished.. . Also why’d you edit your first original reply to say something completely different? The context is confusing now, and would have been a good lesson to learn for anyone else reading, since a lot of people make that same mistake of assuming something is a joke without actually knowing if it is or not.,2
guess i missed the massive pigtails on that girl, mb,5
and i said i'm guessing.,-20
please do list them.,-1
maybe take a look at... all the other official art?,13
there's no evidence pointing to that. in fact, it's more like there's more evidence pointing to the opposite. if it's changed, then i think that she's attracted to guys *too*, but the women aspect hasn't changed. you do bring a fair point to the table, though.,3
Yeah, that's possible. But when its hinted she dated another girl then those two add up to a decent amount of evidence.,1
it's just an aesthetic choice. the piece in rendered with blue, pink and yellow, though it doesn't mean it reflects the actual colors of the clothes and hair. i think you're just trying to brush this off in favor of another ship you prefer, instead of looking at it objectively...,5
thank you, i never would've guessed! time to go back to my medieval house,-8
Cool ,-1
it hasn't been proven false. maybe try not freaking out and putting together a coherent argument.,-1
My point still stands on the bow.,1
let's do this again: the creator does not mean to explicitly state something for it to be canon. that's just bad writing.,0
Yeah, you will not stay my ship from the path of God.,-1
okay. but why do you assume that aubrey's straight, anyway? apart from stuttering a little bit when talking to sunny (after she beat him up and talked about his dead sister insensitively and taunted him for being unable to go outside) , there's no actual proof she's attracted to guys at all, seeing as headspace is just sunny's ideal world.,11
You don't kiss another girl to "experiment".. . Touching fire is for babies, teens are beyond that, they know the things they don't like, so if a girl willingly kisses another girl to "experiment" it only means that she wants to try that, she wouldn't try something she doesn't like, say, spinach, unless she was forced/encouraged to.,0
technically theres no difference between the two labels, its just whatever the person feels most comfortable identifying with,61
wait why not just make them be the same thing then. if someone bisexual is into both dicks and vaginas, and a pansexual is someone who is into all genders (which i thinks is mainly referring to pronouns here???? i think??  i dunno im trying my best to be all inclusive) but since there aren’t any other biological genders (i think?), then in the end they’re also into people with dicks and vaginas, then isn’t it the same thing? or are pronouns that much of a deal breaker for bisexuals???. . dude im so confused im sorry i should’ve just fucking googled instead type all this shit out,7
But there are only two genders so wouldn’t they still be the same?,1
why is this downvoted? mfs thats literally what it means,8
Bi is two gender pan us every gender,-6
Yes it is I, Eric Cartsans. Sacrifice your big bones to me or I will give you a bad time and make you eat your parents,1
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!,8
Eh they can assume that based on your reply. But it’s not completely different, I just deleted a part pf it.,1
I was thinking it might be an earlier concept design with her hair down or something. Omocat's drawn several different interpretations of Sunny from what I've seen in her site (Mari, Hero, Basil and Kel as well have had different designs). Even Aubrey looks  different here with a Japanese school uniform and different facial proportions from the game, so I'm very interested to see what the behind the scenes for development for the designs was like!,11
The reading comprehension devil strikes again.,29
Heromari,. Pretty Boy x Jock,. Bebe x Maverick. . the rest are in the headcanon land,11
I am pretty sure every post-truth aubrey in official art doesn't change clothes except the merch art,0
Oh if there's sufficient evidence, why are you making an argument without presenting the evidence? . . It's fine if Aubrey is gay or bi in your head cannon. It's just not something that has been explored in the official lore.,6
Oh, when was that hinted? I completely missed it in my playthrough,3
Pointing out one of my spelling mistakes and acting all snarky isn't going to prove your original argument.,17
I am quite calm actually. And yes it has been clearly proven false by multiple people here. I don't think there was even an argument to begin with since there is no proof for the ship being canon in the first place. You can say anything you want now but I already proved all of your "theories" false in my last comment,7
Only the bow? Bro,3
Ofc they have, if it's not hinted anywhere nor said anywhere that this would be canon, then it's not canon. That's it and there's no more to it. You can support this ship ofc but it is not canon,5
Then by your logic I could say sunburn is 100% canon and that HeroMari isn’t.,6
What path, all the gods dead smh,2
[removed],1
Babies touching fire is a bad thing to compare that too, babies touch fire cause they  dont know the consequences, ( some ) teens do things cause they think fuck it lets try it,1
This one's it for me. I feel more comfortable identifying as bi because I have a strong preference towards women (or feminine traits in general). In my opinion, pan means only light preferences or no preferences,21
I don't know if this is right or not, so take this with a grain of salt.   But I've heard that the distinction has to do with how somebody's gender plays into your attraction to them.  With bi, you're actively attracted to more than one gender (i.e. I love apples AND I love peaches.)  With pan, gender doesn't play a part in your attraction to someone (i.e. I love fruit in general, doesn't matter what type.),14
It's just that you can't be sexually attracted to pronouns. Since there's two types of genitalia/bodies, bissexual and pansexual are the same in this case. However panromantic might make sense (even tho you can argue bi still covers that anyway),2
can someone handle thsi confused man im too cis to give an in-depth explanation on this...,1
(its funny because ooc im extremely lesbian),6
i think it struck both of us. can we do this again in a less snarky, more productive way?,1
homophobia detected in omori subreddit,1
that's not what you said, though. you're just amending your argument to be more specific upon being proven wrong.,-5
it's very much there. the whole post is the stuff im presenting as evidence.,1
well, i like being snarky, and you haven't been showing any disposition to change your mind, or to listen at all.,-5
you didn't prove anything. your speculation is as valid as mine.,1
It’s the exact same type of bow, which is one of Aubrey’s main defining physical characteristics.,1
sunburn is just implied on sunny's side and i literally used heromari as an example of a canon ship. seems you're not understanding my logic.,1
okay, still a little confused, but i think i understand a bit more now? thank you!,7
,2
(hehe I'm just extremely lesbian in Any context),4
What else needs to be said.,14
[removed],1
The top left image is irrelevant as many have pointed out, this is art that was too early in development to have any cannon meaning.  We don't even know who the two characters are. (don't debate please, I've seen your argument and still disagree). . The rest of the pics and the fact that they were roomies show that they were close friends. Absolutely nothing romantic is implied. . . Again, have fun with your head cannon, but don't try to convince others that it's cannon.,5
Well, you can continue being snarky all you like, but why would I change my mind? I will change my mind once you show me proof instead of just speculation and fantasies. Plus, what is there to listen to? Listen to your snarky remarks and not try to prove your original argument?,13
Speculation? I was speaking pure facts, you were just saying that's Aubrey because "The hair and clothes are exactly the same" which isn't true. But at least you're calling it a speculation this time,6
You ilusion,2
Bro almost all bows look the same. And since the whole rest of the outfit is different + the hair is wavy unlike with Aubrey, I think it's very unlikely the girl in the picture is Aubrey. And the other girl in the pic is nobody we know either so that strongly hints that both of them are other oc's Omocat has made,3
I’m not understanding your logic because it doesn’t make sense I think. Or maybe you’re just not making it clear enough.,5
your balls have been yoinked away by a non-binary person somewhere in the universe,1
we could go over all the evidence at hand and go through it if you're on board with it? it doesn't have to be an argument with a winner.,1
if you don't mind I'm gonna go sleep now  I don't have energy for this shit,5
jesus christ, man. no need to get aggressive, we're having a discussion.,6
>The top left image is irrelevant as many have pointed out, this is art that was too early in development to have any cannon meaning.. . the omori trailer predates it.. . >The rest of the pics and the fact that they were roomies show that they were close friends. Absolutely nothing romantic is implied. . . first of all holy shit, it's an "and they were roommates" moment lol. second, since omocat already did stuff like pretty boy, it's not unlikely at all that she would make another queer character, and with all the princess carrying and what-not, it just may be aubrey, and that idea looks pretty convincing.,1
so you're not on board? that's fine, genuinely. if neither of us is getting anything out of it we can just end this discussion.,1
i think i'm pretty real.,1
No, there are a lot of different bow types. I’m pretty sure it’s meant to be Aubrey but, like, it’s no sweat off my back if it’s not.,1
hope this is clear enough.. . ,0
What evidence? As I said there is nothing the confirms a relationship,9
i'm not getting aggressive but ok,2
Vast majority of the time, when same sex people are roommates, it's completely platonic so it's silly to say that because they were roomies it implies anything romantic.. .  I've heard your argument and I'm just not convinced. Don't take this as me saying it's impossible for Aubrey to be bi/gay, I just truly don't think there's sufficient evidence to say one way or another.,2
Wasn't on board from the start.,6
Plis You terapia,0
??? Then I was right, your argument makes literally no sense and we were right in our arguments. . . By your logic Sunburn is canon and so is Femkel.,8
not explicitly. let's look at heromari as an example. they're a much more obvious pairing, but their romantic relationship isn't ever referred to as what it is. mari teases hero, says she really likes how responsible he is, calls him handsome and they're always together! yet, they never say they were dating. that's what i'm referring to as 'evidence', hints at stuff. after all, if it weren't true, why would the writers imply it?,1
***???? then what was that just now????***,4
they're not actually roommates, it's just a meme. have you actually played the whole game?,0
then why would you comment. anyways, let's just end it here.,0
okay, you just don't get it. i'm not gonna spend my time trying to present my arguments well when you just have this dense mental wall no one can break. by my fucking logic sunburn is only hinted at on sunny's side. you don't know what my logic is because you're not willing to listen. at all.,0
There's no need to spend so much effort in arguing over a fictional character. You both have your own headcanons and that's fine.,6
[removed],3
Its been a year since I've played and I'm not familiar with that meme. . . So they weren't even roommates. So there really is zero evidence or even subtle hints that Kim and Aubrey had romantic interest in each other.. . Why is it so important to you to try to push this specific narrative?,1
To answer your question? You're the one that asked, "So you're not on board?" and all I did was answer it. You didn't even have to reply to my comment. All you had to do was end it.,8
I listened: Your point is that Omocat made art of Aubrey and Kim. That’s it.. . Thing is, she also made art of other ships such as [Sunburn]() and [Femkel]().. . Just because there is art doesn’t mean it’s canon. You should get it into your head by now. Unless you can prove that Omocat said it was canon, we must stick to what was shown in the game. Which means Sunburn isn’t canon, but certainly more likely.,6
didn't need to call me delusional, but that's valid.,1
OH MY GOD. it's a vine from like 2014 IT'S NOT FROM THE GAME. christ.,1
Yup. I understand that. . . I was just trying to poke a little fun at you but you seem very irritable. I never meant to frustrate you this much. I truly hope your day is going okay.,2
Prepare for a flood of dark-haired Aubrey fanarts in the very near future,452
Now I’m wondering how different the game would be if we got dark-haired Aubrey instead of dyed-haired Aubrey…,126
The art looks nice, but did she dye her eyes as well?,80
I always wondered what she’d look like with her natural hair and without lenses,42
Sunny: Aubrey, before we go on the date, would you put this wig on?  . Aubrey: ...Why?  . Sunny: And wear Mari's old school uniform?,141
Dark haired Aubrey has a bit of a resemblance to Mari ngl,54

Slightly worse, because the only difference is that we wouldn’t get that >!sad little detail about how Aubrey still couldn’t let go of Mari!<,205

Sunny: >!okay now I need you be near the stairs with basil and!<. . &#x200B;. . Aubrey: >!okay sunny, when I was  talking about doing roleplay, this isn't what I had in mind. this is getting weird and  you have some issues you need to work out!<,112

wtf are you talking about, obviously her natural hair color is pink,9
Don't forget her eyes,9
Aubrey dyed her hair and put on contacts, originally her hair and eyes were both dark.,44

Probably referring to the one with dark pigtails, but yeh the one in front with the knife is from Yume Nikki, also solid surreal game, especially if you liked Blackspace from OMORI,25
. . It matters not what Kind of Yuji you are, I will embrace every Choso, MINE!,1
Yep, he saw me looking around the place and started talking to me. Asked me about what kind of games I like and etc. We then exchanged instagram and invited me out for dinner to talk and hangout. It was stupid of me to say yes.  .   . Went and met up with him a week later and all he talked about is Mount Fuji and the God residing there during dinner. After that he brought me to the temple to pray with him. Weird shit but at least I'm still alive lmao  .   . Lesson learned,3
oh mb gng,2
Kel is such a homie, idk how anyone could hate him. . . (Should probably spoiler this btw),1057
The sad part is that in the first message we get to hear from Sunny's mom she points out Kel's been looking for him for months, which probably means she didn't tell him until then,560
Kel:. . ,218
I can't help this so I wanna speak my mind.. . &#x200B;. . >!For Kel it's obvious he enjoys Sunny's company, I mean he went out of his way to literally make him, MAKE him get out of the house, IIRC he tried to call him a couple times and even showed up to his house. Kel is charming in RW and shows alot of empathy to people, even when Aubrey was so distraught and changed, he still cared. That's just Kel. Kel has everyone's backs even when they don't want it.!<. . >!For Basil it's really a fanon thing I think, people believe Basil IS his best friend, and I agree to an extent, there's no denying Sunny WAS best friends with everyone. However Basil was overprotective, clingy (not his fault really) and borderline anxious around Sunny later in the game.!<. . >!As for kids they had that charm that they really a whole lot to eachother, you can tell the chemistry between them in RW even as kids, it's there, you can see it. Even in the photos Sunny allowed him and others to vent on himself. He didn't mind and he loved Basil (platonically ofc). I think Basil was a great friend but his overall personality change made him worse as a human being.!<. . &#x200B;. . These are my thoughts,450
More like Sunny was Basil's best friend, but Kel was Sunny's best friend,222
Kel is the best ,63
(This image is just a joke, don't take it too seriously.) ,143
İ belive you at this,78
İ mean so many others claim to be sunnys best friend as well İts a fanon thing that basil is the only one who gets the title,some people that proclaim to be his best friend is:. . -Basil . -Abbi "will you forgive me,my best friend". -Kel "yeah,we will be always best friends" ( i dont remember if that qoute meant the whole group or not if it dıd then the whole group gets the be his bestfriends),37
To be fair, Basil isn’t exactly the most mental healthy person, I’m sure he would have been just as concerned as kel without his trauma.,32
This unironically. I wish I had a friend like Kel.,54
[deleted],63
Basil has been through worse than Kel has, so I don't really blame him for anything.... . But Kel is my fav for a reason. Bless that basketball boi.,23
I mean.. Friendship isn't a competition? They could both be best friends in different ways? :) . . No? Ok sorry :(,21
Finally,someone with the same philosophy as me. . KEL IS SUPREMEEEEEE ,33
Apart from the few points that are jokes I agree, I think Basil is Sunny's self proclaimed best friend honestly, they used to be very close but now they are only "close" because of the bond they got from >!killing Mari!<,73
Kel is the homie,16
I feel like it's not possible to have a fair comparison here. Kel did not go through what Basil did, and is completely oblivious to the actual situation. We don't know how Kel would behave if he had been in Basil's position. And in Basil's defense, the whole situation clearly traumatized and messed him up mentally. He's terrified, and feels abandoned by Sunny because he can't bear being left alone with the knowledge of what happened. One is mostly fine emotionally, and the other is completely unhinged. They're not comparable.. . That being said, I do think Kel is the best friend Sunny (or anyone) could have.,13
[removed],128
Honestly I feel that Basil is his best friend in a way he understands Sunny the best,29
I thought Kel was Sunny's best friend from the start,13
Basil's brain: trauma, Mari, Sunny, Something, more trauma, edgy | Kel's brain: 🍔 --> That's why Kel is better 😎🧡,35
With Basil you are told he's your best friend.. . With Kel you **feel** like you're best friends.,38
You left out some things about Basil-. . - Is very anxious but nice. - Reads books to you. - tells you about his plants. - vents to you and makes sure that’s okay. - comforts you when you need it. - will defend you no matter what, even at the cost of his own reputation. - suggests hanging your dead sister so you won’t be accused of murder(it’s actually manslaughter but what do they know, they’re 12)??. . Can we not, like, pick and choose who is ”better” among them? I know it’s a meme but people seem kinda serious about it.. Favourite characters is one thing but like none of us are mental health professionals here,39
kel supremacy but also basil is trying his best,26
I found it sweet that when you played Hide and Seek when you first get to Headspace, Kel just stands right behind the pole you were facing. If it was an imagination, then most likely something similar happened irl.,10
Sounds like someone hasn’t heard of Basil nuke.,21
Kel is the best, I think this is definitely true. (Which is also why I like suntan x),19
Well yes in oresent time since Kel is stable mentally and ya know didnt >!witness a murder and doesnt have any guilt regarding it whatsoever!< sure hes able to be a good friend, not just to Sunny but to Basil as well. But its obvious and a fact that before any of what happened, Sunny and Basil were very close and at that point they were much more friends than Kel was at the time.,17
i love how everyone ignores basils trauma, its really just the best  its like comparing a suicidal teenager to a social butterfly, oh wait..,17
I know this is all in good fun but the implications of "even when they were kids" is something I have a problem with in this formulation. Imo young BASIL is shown to be genuinely attentive to SUNNY's emotions, highly supportive, and it's pretty clear that they both choose to spend the most time together. We see memories showing BASIL talking with SUNNY frequently (and worrying that he's being overbearing, showing concern), showing him books which SUNNY later reads on his own initiative, SUNNY showing BASIL pet rocks, BASIL noticing SUNNY's crush and then keeping it a secret, BASIL coming up with the violin idea, BASIL setting up the chairs in MARI's room along with HERO so they can watch the two practice, the two wearing matching flowers in the duet sequence, the two spending a lot of time together after MARI gets busy with college prep, etc. And this might all seem a bit clingy on BASIL's part (there may be some truth to this tbh) but we are told repeatedly (by non-BASIL characters) that SUNNY hates being alone, so again I think this an example of closeness and understanding. Not that SUNNY has no one-on-one time with KEL, the examples there being sneaking out at night to hobbeez and running off during the flower crown memory, but I think it's pretty clearly shown that BASIL is very dear to SUNNY. Plus in headspace, BASIL gets his own house, color pallette, and SUNNY remembers verbatim his quotes about the flower meanings, while KEL kinda gets short shrift, being seen as hyperactive and literally annoying judging by his moveset. He does occasionally support OMORI in headspace, like in the hide and seek at the start, but I think BASIL is clearly given a lot of space in SUNNY's head rent free, >!even in the hikikomori route where the truth is disregarded.!<. . I think >! the incident !<is what really doomed that friendship to be seemingly nonexistent by game start, and at that point KEL deserves massive kudos for being there for SUNNY after all those years. They're clearly very close friends as well, but all I want to say is that BASIL was a genuinely good friend (if anything maybe a little too good during >!the incident!<) and the promise of healing that comes at the end shows that there is potential for "things to go back to the way they were before" to some degree.,15
I always had the impression that Basil considered Sunny to be his best friend of the bunch, while Sunny didn't necessarily have a favorite, at least outside Mari.,7
I think most people agree that kel is the better friend to sunny then basil, it just that basil was kinda forced to be friend after the “incidents”.,21
i do love basil to the moon and back and he is my favourite out of the main friend group, hell, even out of the entire CAST, but to be fully honest, i 100% agree with this post,13
This post has Kel in it. Therefore, not only is it canon, but it also makes Kel THE canon best friend.,17
Basil is probably more fit for sunny, but it’s unfair to compare him to Kel cause KEL IS SUPREMEEE,6
Kel is honestly amazing. I mean, you're depressed, you just spend entire days rotting in your room and yet there's this boy who goes out of his way to knock at your door. Even if you had cut yourself off from everyone.. I relate to the protagonist so much and Kel's efforts really mean a lot I mean he really cares,6
mother fucker basil is traumatized,6
I’m a Kel supremacist ,15
I dont think this is unpopular, kel is universally loved while basil is sometimes hated, and people keep ragging on basil.. . The unpopular opinion is that basil is the better best friend because he was willing to basically become an accomplice to a "murder" and share the guilt with Sunny, and even when Sunny disappears for 4 YEARS he didn't say anything and let it fester inside of him to the point of suicide instead of telling the truth, which may hurt his own reputation, but will hurt Sunny's more. He also takes the blame for blacking out the photos, which he gets bullied by Aubrey for.. . Kel is a good friend with good intentions and a lot of persistence, but people need to know that he demonized Aubrey (who was also suffering) and that, MOST IMPORTANTLY, he acted like everyone should be the same after an important death in their group, which would be actively ignoring and drawing importance away from Mari's death. That, in my opinion, is a huge flaw that people think is a boon. Acting like people are the same after the event is saying to the others that Mari's death didn't mean much to him, rather than him moving on fast. That makes him seem insincere to Hero (who had to get angry at Kel after a year of grieving to move on slightly) and Aubrey (who hated Kel for moving on quickly). . It also doesn't help that we don't see many interactions between Basil and Sunny in the real world before Mari's death, but thats just how the game is structured.,18
Why is everyone ignoring the fact that Basil is depressed, paranoid, and suicidal? When did this stop being a game about depression and start being a game about finding who the goodest and bestest friend was? I really don't understand why this sub is obsessed with tribalism to the point of shaming characters for their mental illness. It's not even like there's a central conflict around who is the best person to Sunny, no one gives a shit except the fans looking to get into dumb arguments,16
Keep it unpopular,11
Omori fans when you ask them to have literally any grasp of nuance:. . I'm aware this post is a joke, but just wanted to offer some thoughts. I see a lot of Kel fans say shit like "He's so healthy" or whatever, seeing him as nothing more than the nice guy who got Sunny out of the house, unironically believing he's flawless, acting like him having a romantic relationship with Sunny would go perfectly, etc. Kel is clearly not a healthy person, even if he's coped better than his other friends, and tbh, I think people missed the point if they think that. He's less visibly unhealthy than Basil or Sunny, but he is still in dire need of therapy.. . That aside, everyone's actions are easily explainable with a little thought, and Sunny still dreams of Basil in more significant ways than Kel (saving Basil, his Jesus like status, appearance before everyone else in memory lane after he *stabs* Sunny, memorizing his plant facts and bedroom layout, memorizing the distance to his house if not necessarily the route as seen in Headspace), and even comes outside for the express purpose of saving Basil, as evidenced by the fact that he sees Basil before waking up and leaving the house in the Sunny room, having spent years consumed by guilt because he knew Basil well enough to form the Stranger and be aware of how shitty Basil's life would be without him.. . That wasn't directed at you, OP, just something I wanted to say in general, because these things have annoyed me within the fandom.. . TL;DR (it's like 10 sentences, though) Kel fans act like he's healthy and flawless when he's not/Basil is clearly Sunny's best friend. . Probably going to get downvoted for an unpopular opinion but w/e lol,24
I agree but no one is a better friend than the Morbius movie,11
I believe in Kel supremacy,5
what trauma does to a mf,5
How is basil even a friend at this point (please don't get mad at me I'm just saying my opinion),23
So, where is the unpopular opinion?,3
i think you could look at it either way, it depends on the kind of person you need like kel is cool if you wanna be outgoing and friendly and surface level and stuff which works for some people i’m not saying he’s a bad friend of course he cares and is nice but with basil it seems like they were able to have fun and also talk about serious stuff, venting to each other, consoling each other emotionally, something kel kinda lacks at. i think basil didn’t try to contact you because of the guilt and reminder of the incident by looking at sunny and the bullying at school probably made him insecure about going outside a lot and possibly encountering some of those kids like he did when aubrey pushed him in the lake.,4
Okay, the different uses of “hangs” together got me.,4
basil stabbed our eye? It wasn't sunny bashing his head on him until both were unconsicous huh,7
🔫,8
Correct 100%!,3
You can nuke with Basil using the tulip hair stick . . Kel is still 1000x superior tho,3
based opinion,3
We all need a friend like Kel,3
kel IS canon though,3
super based and true opinion,3
Yeah KEL is the better friend ,3
I actually found a way to nuke with basil in the party :p. . Make omori manic and basil happy of some sort. Then use cheer. . . Omoris speed increase let's him use vertigo super effectively reaching heights the Kel nuke can only dream of,3
Kel is chad as fuck ,3
While your opinion is very valid and Kel and Sunny’s relationship was clearly more positive than Basil and Sunny’s, it’s a little unfair to compare them like this. And I’m just saying this as though they were real people since their characters are very real to me.. . Basil could never be Kel no matter how much he tried. He doesn’t have the personality that Kel has, and he can’t just try to blend back into normal life after tragedy, especially after his involvement. Basil needed to talk to Sunny after the event, but Sunny wasn’t there to talk to so he had to deal with all of that on his own on top of being bullied by his ex-best friend, living without his parents and knowing his grandma was dying, etc etc. He is incredibly anxious and depressed, so he might not have the will or ability to reach out in the way Kel did, plus he was probably constantly breaking down on himself and was filled with self-loathing. And saying things like how he “needs to be saved various times” is a joke I know, but it’s really unfair to call him a bad person for needing to depend on people.. . Idk, I agree that Kel would have been better for Sunny as a person to rely on and get help from, but the way you compared them just kinda rubbed me the wrong way.,3
,3
Kel: Open about his feelings, tells Sunny about that one time Hero got upset. . Basil: "SOMETHING BEHIND YOU DID IT",3
I tried spoiler-marking but this...goofy interface wouldnt let me. . But there shouldnt be a problem since the meme itself is a spoiler. . Yes I know its a meme and I'm sorry for what you're about to read but I heard many people still hate Basil with disturbing passion and. . And I'm bored. . Basil must've had a pretty dark and messed up mindset. His grandma has been taking care of him for his whole life. She wasnt probably of best health since she went into catatonic state, which I presume doesnt happen often even among older people. We can assume she has been feeling that way for quite some way now, and her sickness peaked a few months prior to the events of the game, resulting in her falling into a 'coma'. So Basil was probably not taken care of enough, he didnt have parental figure and mustve felt pretty lonely overall, even if he had friends, because his house was not entirely his 'home'. Also, in Sunny's memory we can't see his grandma participating in the celebration of Basil's birthday, so we can assume she wasnt fit to do much things for him \[although this point is a bit, hm, hazy\[?\], since Sunny may have 'erased' adults from his mind on Memory Lane because he wanted to focus on friends\].. . !My point is, Basil had quite sad childhood which probably resulted in him having darker worldview. I headcanon he also found some messed up stuff online since he had nobody to supervise him and stuff. If he had access to Internet at all ofc.. . Back to the point! Ofc the idea of faking your friend's suicide to cover up for your best friend's crimes is messed up, but that how Basil's mind was. Besides, he mustve feared losing his friends, especially Sunny, who was his best friend back when they were kids. His friend group would surely break if they found out Sunny murdered Mari, and Sunny himself would 99.99% leave his ex-friends \[idk if 12yo can be put into juvenile in USA, I really doubt especially since Mari's death was an accident, but if police was informed about all of this, the word about Maris' death would prob get out and all citizens may have started despising sunny's family, so they'd prob move out and stuff...or sunny might've went to some mental health facility or sth\]. Besides, it all was extremely traumatizing and shocking. Basil and Sunny probably shared a bit deeper bond, and seeing your best friend scared fecesless because he accidentally killed his sister and frisked up his whole and other people's life, not even on purpose, and the overwhelming feeling of 'it could've been so easily avoided'....bruh, they were 12. Sunny had no idea what to do, so Basil took initiative and prob. decided it'd be better to hide everything and hope that everything would be back to normal in some time, rather than letting the terrible truth out. Well, the consequences wouldnt be extremely pleasant.. . Maybe he also didnt want to see his friend as a killer. He thought of the whole "something" thing after all. It wasnt Sunny who killed Mari, it was something. Something stood behind sunny, it mustve looked like he was the one to push her, but he didnt, something pushed her, not Sunny. Something scribbled all over the photos, it wasnt Sunny. \[Or maybe he was afraid of Sunny and tried to please him by saying he wasnt guilty so that he wouldnt hurt him next; I want to say its just an unlike theory, but it makes a bit sense. . Like yea they couldve called 911 but they were kids, shocked by the sudden tragedy. People lose common sense when theyre scared.. . So, was the idea of faking suicide absolutely terrible? Yes. Was it understanadble? Yes.. . ok next point. . Basil has extreme anxiety, frequent panic attacks and has been overwhelmed by extreme guilt and shame for the past 4 years, he has no friends, his grandma probably couldnt be much support for him, not mentioning she fell in a coma a few months before events of the game, hes been bullied by his former close friend, he has hallucinations and doesnt receive any help. Not at all. Not from a psychologist, not from his friends, he cant even go to his grandma and tell her 'i feel sad, can i get a hug/can we talk', because shes practically dying at this point (on the wiki it says that his grandma probably died on one day left). Whenever we see him he's extremely stressed out, nearly all his sprites show him either sweating, frowning, crying or being sad in general, in fact I dont think he has ever smiled happily in the real world (except for secret cutscene).. . He and sunny were supposed to be together in their guilt and shameful knowledge, they were supposed to bond by their trauma and maybe help each other get through it (Basil says "promise me we'll always be there for each other"), but they didnt, Sunny barely went outside in the span of 4 years, not meeting any of his friends, not communicating through any other means. Ofc he'd feel betrayed when his partner in crime suddenly leaves the town without saying anything. Like yea, they didnt talk for nearly half a decade, but maybe the thought of sunny still being close and living basically a street away somehow comforted Basil. Maybe he thought that Sunny was the last person with whom he could speak and feel positive emotions without feeling guilt and stuff, but Im not sure since he basically looks scared of Sunny.. . Ofc Basil'd need to be saved, he's so stressed out I'm surprised he's even alive at this point. Its a headcanon, but I think he may also have agarophobia (a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong, some/most of people basically are scared to leave their house, others can go out but with a trusted person that will know what to do in case of emergency/won't judge them for e.g panic attack and stuff). He went out like 2 times, but it was in order to retrieve photo album. Looking at how much stress he experiences daily, how he's bullied, and how terrible he feels, I'd say he managed to go out solely because he was really determined.. . There was no time for Basil to apologize for his mistakes. After the fight we only see his sprite and maybe a short animation of him, he doent get to say anything but he'd surely apologize to Sunny after their emotions calm down. Talking with him and making a good apology would surely be hard for him considering how he felt towards his best friend for the past 4 years, but I'm sure he'd eventually get there and have a serious conversation with Sunny.. . Sunny and Basil's relationship is complicated, Basil is clearly scared of him despite wanting to keep close 4 years ago, maybe he's scared of what he might do, maybe he reminds him of the incident, maybe he's scared he might tell the truth, or he's scared of the 'something'. Honestly I forgot a lot of things despite finishing the game this week. Good thing I'm replaying it again rn.. . The things Sunny and Basil did cant be fully judged imo, because they were kids, not wanting to have their whole lives destroyed, one of them potentially mentally scared. Of course faking suicide was a huge mistake, but we can't just leave it at 'guilty' verdict (even if its just a video game, hm, i need a life).. . As teens, Sunny and Basil are both extremely mentally destroyed, have phobias, psychosis, panic attacks and all the good stuff that came free in a package of 'trauma after commiting a felony'.. . ~~So, no, Your Honor, Basil isn't necessarily a bad friend.~~. . Um actually Your Honor do you accept headcanons as evidence??,3
I unironically dislike Basil and Kel, but I prefer Kel by far,5
You see basil is your best friend. Kel is just your Bester best friend,4
Listen, I'm bias to Kel and Hero so I'm gonna agree with this post but also I just don't like Basil. . . Don't get me wrong. Love his design. He's got a cool story but I just don't enjoy him as a character (maybe thats just some inner thing with me) everytime he was on screen I just couldn't help but be uncomfortable?? Idk . . I enjoy Kel as a character because he's someone I would want to be/be friends with. He reminds me of myself (probably why I'm bias),5
Do people forget that Basil also experienced almost the same trauma that Sunny has not to mention also losing his grandma and having no support from his parents,6
[removed],6
Kel best boy. . Basil best princes ,2
Based on what we know this is definitely true, and I’m pretty sure most of the community agrees but I could be wrong,2
TRUE,BASED AND REAL!!!!,3
I always thought this was absolute, never thought it was an unpopular opinion,2
does anyone have an ss or know when exactly kel calls sunny/omori his best friend and brother?? or know where i can find it? thanks in advance! ,2
Basil is adorable though :3,2
Not really fair to compare them.,2
On the one hand, Basil's personality matches more with Sunny's.. . On the other, Basil >!fuckin' gouged his eye out.!<. . So yeah, I think it's fair to say that Kel is a bit better friend.,2
This was my only "complaint" about the game to any degree. The only part that ever legitimately puzzled me was how they were selling Basil as someone so close with Sunny when Sunny hardly ever seems to acknowledge him in the photos or rest of the game. Even though Sunny is pretty reserved, he still seems to acknowledge everyone else more at every point. You get maybe one or two pictures, but it always seemed like Basil had a much higher opinion of Sunny than Sunny has of him. Basil might have considered Sunny his best friend, but like OP says Kel by far acts like Sunny's best friend way more than anyone else. I wish they had shown more of Basil and Sunny being best friends than simply telling us that was apparently the case. Basil has always been my least favorite of the main cast because he feels like a plot device more than a character, and even when he is a character, he feels like the most stereotyped to me.,2
No, they’re equal except that Kel didn’t go through things as bad as Basil did. Basil was neglected and abused, but still, at least he wanted to help Sunny.. . And he had a broken “normalcy compass” so his actions, unintentionally, are more harmful than helpful.. . But I still think that Kel is a really good friend, because he cares for all of them. :),2
Yeah the dude with his own family and friends that has had four years to heal from a death that probably affected him the most through Hero's grief is more well-adjusted than the dude whose family and friends have went MIA (partially due to taking the blame by Aubrey for something Sunny did) while going through similar mental issues as the literal hikikomori. Go figure.,2
You can’t even compare Kel to Basil; they’ve had completely different lives and traumas. Basil doesn’t even have parents in his life and Kel has still married parents and two siblings 😭. . Based on what you’re saying, Aubrey and Hero would also be considered better best friends to Sunny but the thing is that they all interact with Sunny differently for a reason.,2
Basil: Flower boy. Kel: Not Flower boy. Basil is superior,2
Kel is the only reason that you could get the good ending in the game, you wouldn’t have gone out if he didn’t knock, just saying,2
I don't think that's an unpopular opinion tbh, I think everyone knows Kel is way better then Basil (I love Basil).,2
I fucking hate this so much for one thing Basil did try to get sunny outside it’s implied on the hikiomori route and second basil is a good friend he’s not in the best place mentally it’s like comparing a serverly mentally I’ll teenager to a mentally stable person,2
at this point it's known facts that basil is a dum dum,6
Wait, Basil didn't apologize?. . Does >!the scene after their fight where he apologizes to you outside your house!< not count? I think it should.,4
this is why i ship suntan........,3
I like Basil better as a character because there’s so much in him to look into, but Kel would be a way better best friend than Basil.,4
Acctually he CAN'T beat the 6 bullies but ok. The thing is, while Kel might be a better kind of a friend Basil and Sunny have a better connection with each other. Kel isn't a quiet guy like Sunny, Basil is. Not like quiet plus "loud" kid combination can't work out and is bad, it's a great combination but i feel like Kel is someone Sunny befriended and would spend time with a third person like Aurbey rather than spending time with just him alone.. Basil just matches Sunny's personality so it's no wonder Sunny considers Basil as his best friend.,3
Basil is the worst (affectionate). I spent the entire game examining, emphasizing, and learning about Sunny's torment, sorrow, and anguish, only to be smacked in the face with Basil having a worse grip on reality and somehow, a worse sense of accountability. After freshly overcoming his own trauma, Sunny has to run to save Basil from killing himself.,3
WAIT!. . Basil - >!"Hangs" your sister,!< traumatizing everyone for the rest of their life. . Kel - Always **"hangs"** out with you, is **"by your side"** throughout the whole game,2
Also apparently Basil also reached out to Sunny following what happened,2
The classic reddit "unpopular opinion". I don't think anyone is arguing that Basil is better for Sunny than Kel.,3
the mischaracterization is crazy but this is from 2 years ago so I'm not even gonna argue,1
This is a really weird point to make ngl and I hate that it's using Basil's trauma to prove something...I hope whoever made this post is really young and doesn't understand how life and emotions work, because I would be definitely disappointed if it was an adult whose brain is supposed to be fully developed. Either that or it's a joke.. . Kel is my favorite character and I think he's an amazing friend to Sunny, but you can't compare a guy who has been traumatized by literally watching Sunny kill his own sister and a guy who has way better social skills and not even half the trauma Basil is going through. Let's not use Basil's sufference against him...how could he even knock on Sunny's door after all that happened? Kel had all the incentives to knock on that door...Basil didn't.. . Basil is literally malnurished, while Kel is a strong and fast teenager doing sports...not a flex (no pun intended). . Again, Kel CAN be there for Sunny because his mind isn't effed up, while Basil CAN'T for very obvious reasons. . Basil has apologized plenty of times lmao the whole game he's out there literally blaming himself for what happened even when it was Sunny who killed Mari.. . "He thinks there's something behind you for whatever reason" I'm starting to think this is a joke, not a funny one though, not even gonna comment on this one.... . "Accuses you of betrayal for moving away" RIGHTEOUSLY SO (in some way)...Sunny literally left him during a panic attack, he basically could have died in there. Plus it might not be his fault inherently, but he never wanted to confront Basil about what happened in the past, so Basil thought he hated him.. . I guess Reddit is gonna Reddit...I'm just gonna pretend you're trolling.,1
Sunny relates more to basil,0
Also Kel:. Does *not* hang your sister.. . Seriously, remind me why Sunflower exists and why some people think Sunny being with his suicidal accomplice is "wholesome".,1
Kel is just the best person you can have, KEL IS PERFECT  (and Basil scares me-),1
i think i get why people hate basil now,1
Bruh,1
Kel great but you need to remember that basil was suffering with as many mental health issues as sunny . . Give him a break ok,1
But Basil is a cinnamon roll. . edit: I guess jokes aren’t allowed here,-1

And this is why i said it and will say it again.. I FUCKING HATE BASIL. BASIL SHOULD FUCKING DIE AND ROT IN HELL.,-22
Kel is a real homie, the kind of guy who always has your back.,1
Not only is he the best friend, he is the best character,1
My bf has a similar personality to Kel's.... . It's chaotic sometimes... ,1
I like the 🥯🍉 because [he’s](),1
I think it's less Basil being your friend and you having to be the best friend to Basil.,1
how do you nuke pole with Kel,1
that's why i hate basil,1
Wdym can throw nuclears???,1
Unpopular how?,1
id say this is a popular opinion,1
Kel, albeit indirectly, >!Prevents Basil from killing himself, gets Sunny to finally get out of the house after four years of isolation, which then finally allows Sunny to confront the truth, tell everyone, and move on.!<. . Kel’s sheer determination to make things up for drifting away from everyone really carries the plot tbh,1
>!Yeah one hangs and one hangs out!<,1
Everyone needs a Kel in their life,1
Kel was a ride or die from day one, if there was a friendship meter like in stardew for fw I 100% would’ve maxxed it. . Also they fit the “quiet soft friend and loud outgoing friend” troupe which is a personal favorite,1
Kel is such a good friend to Sunny in RW that it actually makes me a little emotional thinking about it. Not only does he never give up on trying to help Sunny out of his house, but he’s genuinely just so kind, and thoughtful of other people’s feelings (ie asking Sunny if he wants a high-five instead of just doing it). As well as always making sure Sunny is a part of all the conversations that go on, and making him feel “heard” even if he doesn’t speak, and it never feels like he’s pity-ing him either. Kel is like the best friend someone in Sunny’s position could ever ask for.,1
I kind of agree even though I love them both ngl, fair point,1
Headspace facts VS Real world facts hold a MUCH different weight from one another. One is their actual behavior. The other is Sunny/Omori's perspective on them. There's also a handful of points I don't quiiite agree with.. . > Only appears during 5% of the game. . That has to do with Omori suppressing the memory of Basil, since it also reminds him of the traumatic event. Basil is also upset during the Real World encounters, since.... . > Accuses you of betrayal for moving away. . This one is a little iffy. Right after the traumatic event, Basil makes Sunny promise that they'll be there for each other, no matter what. It's the opening cutscene of the game and establishes their current relationship. It's not "betrayal", it's the breaking of a promise.. . > He thinks there is something behind you for whatever reason. . Sunny's trauma comes from the accidental involvement with the traumatic event. His "Something" manifests as the direct result of his mistakes. Basil's, on the other hand, comes from thinking his best friend intentionally caused the traumatic event. That's why he thinks there's "something behind you". While your trauma is connected to Mari, Basil's is connected to Sunny.. . **but yeah Kel is 1,000% the better pal**,1
kel is the guy,1
That’s fair,1
Sunny might as well just call kel and hero his brothers,cause BOTH of them are more than just friends,1
Kel is also referred to as a brother multiple times in the game. Clear evidence that he and Sunny were close.,1
I love Basil so much... but yeah, Kel sets a standard of friend that's hard to beat.,1
Fr thoo Kel is the OG best friend of Sunny. Not Basil.,1
Kel is seen as a brain rot but is criminally underrated,1
Basil and Sunny are trauma besties. Kel probably better friend tho,1
< (basil's still a decent character I just like Kel more),1
Wait ,Sunny and Kel ,OR SUNNY X KEL ,1
I actually think that too, I always though that Sunny would find more comfort in Kel,1
Yeah he's quite the charm ain't he? I mean I struggled to enjoy his company in HEADSPACE but once I saw him in RW and understood him... that's when it clicked.. . And yeah mark as spoiler... too many mistakes have been made for this sub,335
Right, I forgot ,100
kale ibs gud amd gud fer u,39
I'm personally biased to Sunny's mom being negligent, but that's my opinion.,332
[deleted],47
&#x200B;. . ,33
His personality didn’t change, his anxiety just got extremely severe after the accident. Understandably so. They’re all very traumatized, none of them are really fundamentally bad as people. (Not that traumatized people can’t be bad people),83
If I remember right, Sunny calls everyone his 'best friends' in the Memory Lane, and agreed with Basil's personality, there is almost no positive traits, poor guy.,214
I wouldnt say its fanon to say sunny and basil were the closest. In his photo album Basil said that they started hanging out more and we just see them together alome a couple times after,36
i disagree, as much as i love kel, i think that basil’s personality is much better fit for sunny. we only get glimpses of basil and sunny’s friendship before the incident, but he seemed like sort of a mentor to sunny (multiple images if them crying together, which implies that sunny was able to have serious discussions and show his emotions with basil, something that he wasn’t really able to do with anyone else other than mari). even with all his flaws basil is much slower paced and more thoughtful than kel imo, which is something that sunny needs.. . even in all of his greatness, kel neglects to show any care about or check in with how sunny feels about anything for the entire real world segment of the game, which is a flaw that most people ignore,116
A nice and logical point of view, just as expected from you comentor...,21
Exactly how I see it ,64
>!Or maybe they changed after 4 years and the incident!< ,34
always and will forever be the best ,13
its canon, it has kel in it,79
i don't care, i will take it seriously anyways ,117
No... it's correct. It's Canon even without the meme. It's literally facts it literally CANNOT be disproven. (Except for maybe the garden shears part but that's headspace),26
What?? But it actually makes some good points though, I don’t see why it should be treated as a joke.,5
Thank you for summarizing a point the game makes over and over again. >!Basil's appearance is meant to be deceptive. Of course, in Headspace, Omori would downplay their friendship with Kel; he doesn't want Sunny to answer Kel's call. The focus is on an Aubrey who likes him and a Hero who respects him, not on a Kel who is just... there.!<. . The message of OMORI, to me, is about what it really means to be a good friend to someone. >!It's not dying for someone, lying for someone, or even fighting for someone. It's smiling for them. Having fun for them. Maybe even annoying them. That's how you help a friend, not by suffering with them, but by enjoying yourself with them. And it's fascinating to see just how badly Basil gets it all wrong.!<,2
[removed],21
Without trauma it means that like, Sunny wouldn't be inside his house for four years sooo.. that doesn't really count or anythings,1
what if you are the kel friend for instead ,36
Both. Both is good. . Kel is cool though,17
I agree. But then again Kel is also like stable mentally as well,10
They can be. I honestly headcanon those three as besties after true ending.. . Because let's be honest, >!Kel would forgive Sunny and Basil very quickly. I feel like Hero and Aubery would also forgive, but have much more negative feelings between them, so while having good realtionship, they woudn't be "the best friends"!<,14
,11
Kel Drip?,5
Agreed about self proclaimed best friend, they were quite close, but that is just from Basil's perspective (Photo Album)... Sunny was probably close to everyone in the group (Basil was the last one to join, Kel the first, based on the Final Duet).,38
That's very true,>! like after the incident they never had that chemistry ever again, probably even after the ending, the death of Mari both had a negative and mental impact on them.!<. . Friendship is easily forgiven but not in this case, they were so devastated...,28
What how did you do that,2
Universally loved moment.,48
Yep, it’s the way sunny perceived basil for him to be his best friend, not how we perceive him,18
Agreed ,9
Exactly!,2
THANK YOU. I’m a little uncomfortable with some of these comments here…,16
This is my first time on the sub after just completing the game. Am I missing something with the ending? How I interpreted it, Sunny and Basil decided on the hanging together. Basil probably only did the actual action because it's Sunny's sister. It's not like he just walked up to Sunny and immediately suggested staging a suicide. They were both panicked. Basil also was so traumatized that he was convinced some sort of monster killed Mari behind Sunny. Two twelve year olds just witnessed someone they both loved die in front of them. They are both overwhelmed with grief, shock, fear, and panic. They don't want lose all their other loved ones so they go with the staged suicide. It's irrational in hindsight, but it's pretty obvious that no one was in their right mind during that. I wouldn't be surprised if Basil or Sunny immediately regretted it, but didn't reverse it out of horror at seeing Mari's body again.. . All and all, I don't get why so many people seem to be putting all of the blame on Basil. He didn't do anything more than Sunny. If Sunny didn't agree to the staged suicide he would have stopped Basil. And honestly I really, really doubt that Basil came up with the idea at all, he's kind to everything and loves life.. . So am I missing something with the Basil hate on this sub?,5
I mean in real life (duh) not Headspace. (Also, Kel's nuke is stronger and he can use it whenever you want, while Basil's hits everyone and is only usable in the boss rush.),28
,9
yesyesyesyes YES   ,5
yUp this comment section is so lovely 😍,9
1000% agree and many times more. Basil was really there for Sunny when he needed him. Their friendship is one of the most genuine ones soured by a tragic incident. My view is that Basil really wanted to help Sunny, but made it much worse instead, which is the guilt he carries and Sunny knows this, but is very conflicted about it due to what Basil had done, but would never forgive himself for leaving him behind, for he did the same as Basil.,7
That's a deep-ish look that makes sense.. . Kudos.,1
Gee.,1
Nearly all of these comments are.,1
Yeah this take is not controversial at all, but the OP felt that this might contradict the consensus that Basil is Sunny's best friend, which is stated and proven in the game, but before that we need to defend our universally loved Kel:. . He only demonized Aubrey after she nearly killed Basil and before that yelled at him pretty maliciously. He showed in the first day outside a lot of understanding towards Aubrey, but worded things a bit too unempathetically which is why he was not able to reach her. Yes he does want things to be as they were before, but he isn't alone in this and all the others wished for the same thing. The difference is that Kel doesn't think too much about most stuff and can move on from one point to another far better than others, which makes him look like he moved on too quickly, when he is actually just as sad, but doesn't want it to tie him down. He did end up help Hero as he allowed him to see how much grief and worry he caused for others and with Aubrey he was thanks to Hero(who wouldn't be the same without Kel) able to mend their friendship. . . Back to Basil: He shows a lot more devotion and dedication to his relationships than anyone else in the story, which is why he made all the photos and even has  gone so far to protect Sunny, which would warrant in that sense the title as best friend. However I think the reason why Basil is Sunny's best friend, which I think is even shown in the game due to how many close moments they had in the story and understood and shared a lot of pain and trauma with one another to the point that they are almost of one mind. They even share similar clothing styles and Sunny fully remembers all of the flower meanings Basil gave to the flowers, showing how much he cares for Basil. . Basil is the best friend Sunny ever had and without him he cannot be happy at all. . . Speaking of which my unpopular opinion is that we get enough scenes with Sunny and Basi to conclude that they are best friends and for the role the flower boy played, he is shown in the game more than enough. . . Maybe they could show more of him, but I think we would have to wait for an update or a remaster for Omori. . . Anyway, this is my view on it.,3
I agree with everything else but saying Bagel is a better friend for covering up a suicide when Sunny was too out of it to even encourage it and that caused their whole friend group to drift apart is.....,10
Kel didn't demonize Aubrey, he was just in his feelings...he's allowed to be mad at her, it doesn't mean he really believed it. Aubrey isn't perfect either, therefore as Hero said, "it's just your usual Kel and Aubrey fight".. . Kel most definitely didn't treat anyone the same...what!?...Hero got mad NOT because of Kel, but because he was venting his own feelings, Kel was literally trying to console him. I think you're wrong about that take on Kel, because you're painting him as the dumb one who thinks everyone is happy, when infact he was deeply concerned at Hero's depression and he never moved on the way Aubrey describes...if anything it's her who thinks he's a simpleton and takes him for granted (like literally everyone in the game, even Sunny).. . Great take for Basil, but absolute L take when it comes to Kel.,1
thank you for putting this to words, people really do  ignore basil's 135 unchecked mental illnesses and blame him personally for them,6
Yeah people really don't seem to notice just how important Basil is to Sunny. He's made to be incredibly special in Sunny's dreams, notice how he's the only one other than Omori not to have the same colour pallette as the rest of the gang. As you mentioned, he memorized so much of what Basil told him. And in the end, Basil being in danger is what finally pushed Sunny to facing the truth.. . He lost an eye yet he still manages to give Basil a big smile. I'd go as far as saying, there's nobody alive Sunny cares more for than Basil.,18
İt's morbin' time,1
he has trauma, i think if he was in other circunstances, he will be different,40
[deleted],1
And now goodbye forever strangers, I made this account for the sole purpose of commenting here, I will never see you again,1
flair checks out,5
If I remember right, in the omori route, after learning red hands, enter the neighbour's room and speak with Kel. He gives you a present for being his best friend, a 'brother's handshake' to dub you as an honorary brother.,3
Also another thing is that Basil obviously really cares for sunny and will do anything to keep him safe and out of blame and overall try’s to help him out alot,2
As much as I love him, he ain’t the smartest tool in the garden shed.,12
That was in Sunny’s head. The scene didn’t happen in the real world as Sunny and Basil are both in the hospital.,3
Heh, you got it. Pretty sure you are the first one comenting it!,2
True.,2
Basil has severe abandonment issues and it was shown in the Omori route that he genuinely reached out to Sunny after Mari's death, and Sunny spent years in his own head making up scenarios where he saves Basil and he ultimately does in the real world in both the good and the bad ending of the Sunny route. Post-good ending, it seems genuinely plausible that they could get together because they forgave themselves and each other for what happened, and both of them still seem to love each other, although whether it's romantic or platonic is kind of up to interpretation.,7
Basil flair detected, opinion denied >!(/s)!<,21
Kinda cringe ngl,16
,1
It has appear no other basil haters are here 😔😔,1
He means Kel nuke,1
I liked Headspace Kel as well, he kinda reminded me of Bart Simpson, who's my favorite Simpsons character. Younger Kel reminds me of a feral puppy while older Kel is a grown Golden Retriever lol.,104
The legend has spoken,30
She left him just one steak for three full days despite knowing that Sunny is an hikikomori and that steak was rotten. If Sunny didn't eat at Kel's house he would have starved,203
That's the point, we can only assume. We know his father left due the death of Mari and he become resentful to Sunny, presumably due to him knowing about the truth.. . Even his mother left one piece of steak and kept him waiting for an extra 3 days without anything much to eat or drink so he continued to be malnourished thanks to the line "but I think you're looking a little pale... and kind of thin, too.".. . &#x200B;. . He was neglected to the point he had as a 16 yr/o stay by himself and even face his fears even to no avail. A mother should NEVER leave their son at that age by himself even when he's malnourished, that is both bad parenting and just downright ugly thing to do.,7
good bot,17
>>!You didn't want to disappoint them. Because they were your friends!<. . >!There's some truth to this, I think it took him a while to truly understand and think them as HIS best friends, they WERE just friends, but the longer they were together the better it became for him. Although as I said there's truth to it!<,162
Yeah I mightve worded it wrong. I don't necessarily believe what I wrote but just what most of the fandom thinks.. . Don't want to confuse you hehe ,8
Fair enough, I can respect your opinion, so here's my argument.. . Basil was socially awkward, had anxiety, he even staged Mari's death as a suicide which both messed up him and Sunny but the entire friend group.. . The worst thing Kel has done imo is attack Aubrey or just entirely dismissive of the reality of Mari's death. Like I get Basil is a sweet kid but is severely doubtful to the truth even not trying to visit Sunny.. . &#x200B;. . Kel is a charming and all-around cool kid, he is like Hero, he's a role model and tries to make the situation better. Even with is faults he is still looking out for everyone when trying to stay cheerful.,82
There is no images of Basil and Sunny crying together tho? That's fake. And that flaw about not checking Sunny's state goes for everyone (including Basil), except Aubrey, who worries about him in the swings.,45
I believe it, three,13
It’s a completely hypothetical situation, you can use any reasoning to disprove it. . Clearly just go along with the situation presented,1
Seems Tiring ngl, I praise anyone who could do that,21
>!i don't know about that tbh.. Yeah, kel is a lighthearted and loyal character but what they did goes beyond a simple "sorry i broke your toy and then lied about it" issue lol. I personally could imagine kel distancing himself from both of the boys for a while to digest the information. It would force him to no longer pretend everything is fine and rethink how he views his friends. Though i imagine sunny and basil being able to trauma bond over the experience and maybe have some healthy dialogue instead of shutting eachother out, working on it together. Hero and aubrey are the hardest for me to judge tbh. We don't know a lot about how hero dealt with her suicide and since they were very close, it must've been hard on him. This new information could send him into another layer of grief all over again. But it doesn't really matter in the end. They left how they responded open to interpretation for a reason, and I'm okay with not knowing. Whichever response is valid, it wasn't about them!<,7
>!Mari was first to join actually... and first to leave!<,7
do what exactly?,1
Yay ,5
Like a horde used the chance to... you know.. . Yeah, i am 9 months late.,2
Yeah I do agree with you on everything but the suicide staging idea part, I found this post on it:. . . [picture did not show up for some reason sp the post is in a reply]. . But it’s still not entirely Basil’s fault. He’s not evil or crazy or something just for somehow finding the idea of staging a suicide through some unknown source, he was 12 and panicking, like you said. He also obviously has some kind of anxiety and probably has PTSD from the event. They’re definitely both victims.. . And also this, a quote from someone else:. . ”l've even seen some ppl say that Basil quickly understanding that he had to make everything look like an accident was proof he was fully level-headed and of rational mind and like ?? no?? that's about one of the dumbest most panicky things you can do in that situation, no one thinking rationally would do that and it's more than enough proof that he was just as broken up about what happened as Sunny was.”,2
Kel doesnt have a nuke irl, sunny has the nuke irl,29
Im sorry, I didn't mean to phrase it as a good thing that Basil covered up Mari's death. It was just a good example of how much Basil cared about Sunny.. . Basil saw Sunny was in shock (Basil was also prob not thinking straight), but noticed that Sunny caused Mari's death. He tried to cover it up to make sure Sunny didn't get blamed, shiftung some of the blame on himself. That's disturbing, but pretty selfless when he he could have been absolved of blame if he just told the truth.. . Also, it wasn't because of Basil or his actions that the group drifted apart. It was because Mari, which held the group together through her picnics and personality, had died. It would have been the same in any case, no matter how she died. Meeting together with any of the friend group would have brought back the pain of knowing Mari is gone, and thats why the only people who were still on good terms were Kel and Hero, literal brothers who couldn't avoid each other and only bonded together again after a year.. . Basil made mistakes and caused Sunny's guilt to worsen as a byproduct of trying to 'save' him from being the cause of Mari's death. Even to the point of believing that 'something behind him' did it instead of him.,22
Kel can both be "in his feelings", mad for legitimate reasons, and still demonize Aubrey. That anger that causes strain is on both sides, but whether for valid reasons or not Kel doesn't afford Aubrey the idea that she may be angry still due to grief, misunderstandings or home situations, all three being the root of her actions. I don't necessarily blame Kel for his intolerance of her actions, but from the player's perspective after the situation is cleared Kel's actions certainly doesn't help the situation. . . Hero, being older and more mature, is able to rectify this by being someone who both look up to, but if not for him Kel's provocations would only force Aubrey further away rather than helping her. He doesn't know the full extent of the clash (and didnt even recognize Aubrey at the lake) but he uses their pretense of fighting as a way to get them both to make up, rather than it actually being a small squabble like in the past.. . And Hero did lash out of anger at Kel, because of what he said. In his cemetary dialogue at Mari's grave, Kel mentions that he spoke to Hero and mentioned that Mari wouldn't want to see him like that, and thats when he got angry. Kel was trying to console him, but hit a touchy spot by mentioning Mari. He was getting out his feelings, but the only reason that I can see causing a sudden emotion outburst after a long period of sadness is the mention of Mari. I would ascribe that to being angry at Kel, regardless of if Kel deserved such.. . I didn't say that Kel is stupid or doesn't think, he has a decent amount of emotional awareness, but he seems to prod at the sore spots of both Aubrey and Hero at different parts of the story by bringing up Mari as a crutch as to how they should get back to acting how they used to when she was alive. Of course, not in such an obvious or blatant wording or actions, but in his actions and words he really wants things to go back to the way they were and in a way, his expression of that signals to everyone that he's not nearly as permanently affected as the others, even if he does care about Mari and everyone elses views of Mari.. . It's not that he doesn't know people are sad, it's that hes not careful when treading such topics and as shown by the dinner scene at Basil's house, isn't super keen on reading the current situation much deeper than initial obvious emotion. Provoking others is part of his character in Headspace and whether he notices or not, he also does it in the real world.,1
Also Basil is depicted by Sunny as the most morally upstanding and kind-hearted Person in Headspace, even more than Mari, whom he not only can deny being always great, but has her sometimes teasing Hero and being too soft on Kel and Aubrey. Basil showed empathy towards Boss and was still clear that he should not cause too much trouble, while noticinghow little boss wanted to hurt him. He was also the one we saw in the first cutscene with Sunny and he was always depicted as special to Sunny and they even wear the same clothes in the present. . . This is a very deliberately design choice of Omocat to show how similar they are and how much they are alike, almost like twins and doppelgänger. . . In the end, while Basil did made things worse, his love for Sunny, him being there for him when he needed him the most made Sunny positive enough about himself to really live with his life as long as he could and ultimately the memory of being helped by Basil and all of their good times made him remember the truth in the first place. . He did helped him ironically more than he thought.,9
Yeah, people who hate him seem too forget that he lived through traumatic experiences and he has basically no parents. Polly is the only one who really cares for him and that's sad. I dont count grandma since she is in hospital,33
I guess your right 🤔,1
Hmm yes you do have a point(s),1
She left him steak, enough money for an entire pizza, and potentially days worth of food in the cupboards and the closet (Hero cooked breakfast for Sunny on one day left, so there was clearly more food in the house than just the steak). . Also the steak doesn’t look rotten at all,304
Sunny was out of the house for most of 2 Days Left and 1 Day Left, he probably had more food but just didn't eat it,10
iirc the steak got rotten because they cut off the electricity though, i won't stop believing the mother was negligent, as it's still a single steak for three days, but the steak was unrefrigerated for hours, not rotten beforehand,29
I think maybe the steak was never actually cooked.... . . Since the power was out. The microwave suddenly working when everything else was off wasn't weird to you?,3
Sunny did have food, hero made breakfast for them all on one day left, also, they had running water so he had stuff to drink. Also a parent can easily leave a 16 year old alone for a few days, most can look after themself, which we can see sunny can in the hikikomori route real world sections,19
Leaving Sunny was kind of the only option she had to prepare for the move. Plus 16yo seems old enough to take care of themselves with plenty of food and water,14
But a 16 year old should already know hot at least make some simple food and take care of themself. And she HAD to go so there wasn't really any other option.,9
>A mother should NEVER leave their son at that age by himself. . Huh? Is this referring to *any* 16-year-old, or just one in the sort of state Sunny was in?,3
Didn’t his mom stay for another day just for a furniture sale idk that rubbed me in the wrong direction,1
Ok haha that makes sense,3
Basil was traumatised and had barely anyone to help him with the struggle. If i was traumatised i wouldn't come out either.,34
>Basil is a sweet kid but is severely doubtful to the truth even not trying to visit Sunny.. . He only gave up after Sunny abandoned him. He tried to reach out over and over. Stranger confirms this: . ​,25
Yeah Kel DID attempt to contact Sunny, as Sunny's mother tells us. He even tries to get him to go outside.. . Even Sunny's mother tried to persuade Sunny to do it too. Kel is flawed like all characters but has the most impact in saving Sunny's life as he was a hikikomori.,70
basil asks if sunny’s ok and asks why he looks so scared in the rw segments, even if it takes a lot of strength for him to get the words out. he just doesn’t get a response. there are glimpses of basil and sunny crying together in the photograph sequences between headspace and faraway town,24
Basil tried many times to spend time with Sunny after the incident, and Sunny completely abandoned him. RW and HS confirms this.,6
I believe it, four.,11
>!Quickly dosen't mean instantly obviously. Truth might be final straw, but I don't see it happening tbh. While there would be an conflict, I think those all would end of positive feelings. I know what I said is based on my bias. It all comes to how people intrepet characters, as you said, ending is quite of vauge. In real life, any response would be valid (expect killing someone, but nobody seriously thinks it would happen)!<,5
Like when I pressed on the spoiler text the other texts disappeared and showed the spoiler text only,11
,1
Ah, thanks for the picture. I didn't catch that. He did think of the idea, but like I said and you agreed with. They were both panicking. There's also the point that Sunny did agree to it, it's not like Basil did it secretly behind his back. So going through with it is still on both of them, not just Basil.. . I still find it kind of hard to believe Basil would actually suggest a staged suicide though. Maybe when Basil showed up they discussed ways to make it look like an accident and landed on that? I guess it kinda would make sense to go with suicide since she presumably died by breaking her neck.,1
Ayo????,11
FOCUS PUNCH,5
SOMETHING was created by Basil and inflicted onto Sunny I believe.. . SOMETHING is the personification of the guilt and shame of Sunny's actions but since Basil was involved it latched onto him as a fear,6
Your right hmmmm,1
she also left those sticky notes on the bathroom mirror reminding sunny to brush his teeth, a negligent mom wouldn’t even care if he did or not,230
Other issues like not sending him to therapy or not seemingly doing much to help him at all.. . Not going outside at all for 4 years straight definitely isn't normal.,7
Hm, you've got a point though 🤔,1
Makes sense,2
They didn’t cut off all electricity, it was only the lights. Sunny’s ceiling fan, computer, bedside lamp, and oven are all shown to still work after the lights were cut off,70
Hero cooked food for sunny on one day left, there was definitely other food, also it was only the lights, the other stuff still worked,16
Ah yeah that makes sense. Why didn't the mother think of this beforehand? 🤔 She could've bought buns with marmelade or peanut butter for Sunny. For what I know it doesn't really require any cooling,1
Everything else isn't off. his fridge light worked, his table lamp worked, his ceiling fan worked, his computer worked, and his oven worked. It's only the lights that are out, not all the electricity.,7
He had immense trauma and ptsd, he could barely leave his room to go downstairs, his mother should of, no... NEEDED to be there for him but she wasn't,6
She did, it's very suspicious.. But I don't know how to think about it,1
I believe it, five.,6
>!i think this comes down to world view more than character interpretation due to the open nature of the ending - we don't even get the slightest hint at it besides basil and sunny smiling at eachother if certain requirements are met. (Which is partly why i believe they could work it out) while i personally would like to think they all forgive him and live happily ever after, i don't think most people would stay in such a situation. Based on my own bias of not trusting other people much!<,3
Pretty sure it's just a bug on mobile,15
I have no idea,2
Basil has committed several acts of mass destruction after seemingly being on a "boss rush" in real life,4
Focus -> encourage -> SERIOUS PUNCH,4
Oh… right. That.,3
I believe that's why imo Basil does apologize beforehand, even if indirectly during the incident yet instead of helping positively those words became engraved inside of Sunny's mind and that's why every Something variant apart from Sunny and Basil's main Somethings say the distorted words of "Sunny, I'm sorry".,6
A neglectful mom also wouldn’t be leaving him voice messages at all, and wouldn’t be encouraging him to go outside and reconnect with his friends,180
Why are we assuming that Sunnys mom just chose not to send him to therapy or didn’t even try to get him any? Maybe Sunny himself refused to get therapy, he seemed pretty content with doing almost nothing but lay in bed and interact with nobody all day every day so I’m sure it would’ve been hard for his mother to drag him out and get him to go to a place where he’s expected to open up and talk to a complete stranger. . . >	not seemingly doing much to help him at all. . How can you tell that from a couple of phone calls? She encouraged him to go outside and reconnect with his friends. That’s about the most she could do from where she was.,7
then that's my bad. though this makes me question why wouldn't sunny turn stuff on other than the lights at night to, you know, be less scared in the dark,9
idk, i'd think sunny's mother would've mentioned that there was more than one steak for sunny to eat if that were true. I share momomaltgern21's idea, that Hero bought (or brought from home) food to cook for Kel, Sunny and himself. . and about the lights, right, that's on me, i know. but since it's the second time i'm gonna also add that when lights go out here, it's because there's no electricity lol, so honest mistake.,4
Probably Hero bought food himself? On one day left it was Tuesday, since Three days left was a Sunday, so the stores must be open. Ok nvm anyways, the storee are always open in america xD,1
I assumed that he was hallucinating all that. I don't remember checking the fridge immediately after. But I DO remember a note from the mom saying the power would be out for the night on accident.,5
I believe it, six,3
It is a bug on mobile, fuck reddit mobile,10
[deleted],7
idk it didn't look like there was much in the house for him to turn on aside from kitchen appliances.. . I guess he maybe could've turned on his lamp but that would only help him in the bedroom,15
I feel like Hero would've mentioned that he had to buy it/bring it, and ask why Sunny's fridge was empty. It would be a concerning sight on its own to see your pale, thin friend after he shut himself up for four years, and everyone acknowledges that it is concerning and Hero says himself he should've done more to keep the gang together. It's not in Hero's character to ignore something like that.,1
The phone call from his mom only specified that the lights would go out, not the power. . . and he can't be hallucinating it because 1. He's not even the one who uses the oven, it's Hero who uses that. . 2. The ceiling fan still spins even after he's dead, and I doubt you can hallucinate while being dead.. and 3. You can use the computer with Aubrey, Kel and Hero following you, and none of them question why Sunny is pretending to use a computer that doesn't work,9
I believe it seven,3
Being on reddit mobile is suffering,6
I mean they're moving into a new house and furniture is kind of important for that. Not saying she made a good decision here, but it makes sense that she might think her 16 year old son is capable of taking care of himself for an extra day,54
That makes sense. Thanks. :). . I'm gonna have to replay the game soon. Probably when fall rolls around again.,3
[deleted],2
I believe it eight,2
In any other case I would agree that the lights going out is just another way of saying the power in general, but since the power apparently didn’t go out then in this case I think only the lights being specified is important to note.. . I do agree though that it’s not realistic for a power company to only turn your lights off. So I basically just assume that they either had a backup generator that we don’t see, or for whatever reason power companies do work like that in this universe. It is possible to lose only your lights during a power outage so maybe omocat thought that would apply here too,1
[deleted],1
>A partial power outage is a problem with the home's electrical system. . Well I shouldn't have said power outage, I meant like a tripped breaker or something. . >Mind you, lights often share circuits with the outlets in your home, so the idea of just the lights being off but the outlets working fine is strange (unless the electricians in your house decided to put all the lights on separate circuits, which would be odd.). . I'm not an expert but I have tried to research this before and i think this is how it's commonly done in some places, but it does vary a lot.,1

that's an.... interesting pinwheel aubrry,686
We got depressed, pink hair lady and the smol Mari,383
Their kid looks like a little Mari and I think that is absolutely adorable.,320
Iirc artist was inspired by a fanfic where sunburn results in a girl they name Mari so her similiar apperance is fitting.. . Man i can imagine Mari looking down from heaven/or as a ghost and being so happy the 2 of them became a thing and sunny not only forgave himself and connected with Aubrey but even brought another life into the world.,184
“Sunny, may you do me a favor?”. . . “Sure.”. . . >!”Make sure to don’t push our daughter off stairs, thank you.”!<,149
Thank you, my day has now received its share of wholesomeness.,103
She looks like little Mari, and that's adorable. I bet Sunny would secretly be super-overprotective lol,65
that pinwheel looks kinda weird. . just my imagination,69
Now I want to see them having a son. Give the daughter a little brother.,38
Mark spoilers,27

Maybe the pinwheel tried to revive his family through necromancy but it just turned him into an amalgamation of he and his family together in only one body, but it still researches trough necromancy hoping that will be a way to separate their bodies, until an undead comes in the catacombs and beat the shit out of the pinwheel because he’s the weakest man alive.,3

Is Mari not just sunny with long hair and no depression?,187
man imagine if she even acts like Mari. sociable, hard working, etc. that would be so complicated for sunny,23
Where's the link for the fanfic?,42
>!Delayed Abortion!<,74
Lol. . >!Hope not!<,22
>!" I won't promise, Honey."!<,7
Imagine when she grows up and she brings over a boy to the house.. . (Battle transition). . Boy: **STRESSED OUT**. . Sunny: (looks HAPPY but is actually FURIOUS),61
Yeah, then their son will eat all the sister’s food and she’ll die of starvation and the son will attain trauma and despise food and then we get Omori 2,59
Not a good idea unless there aren't stairs,6
NOT AGAIN,7
Uncle Basil stabbed me,19

(I hope you) fall down the stairs and fall from a scyscreaper,13
fuck you,9
*hoi4 ost axis theme plays* oh no U MADE BASIL FASCIST NOOOOO!!!!,7
Especially because it’s at an angle close to 45 degrees relative to most reference points.,22
what the hell you think? omori between nazism or communism has no relationship, how dare you put into together? is that nonsense?,4
aubrey is not a nazi you cringe ass boi,-1
begone nazi,2
**She has supernatural power**. . >!Also trauma can’t touch her!<,95
Sunny with no depression didn’t seem to be as social as mari,116
"Reincarnated as my little brothers daughter",33
I actually seen a fic of this fankid (?) In AO3 (4 in fact). . 3 created by the same person and is part of his ongoing fic series (1 fic only referencing the child, 1 fic telling us what happened in the 9 months while Aubrey is still pregnant at her and the last one is the kid's life while growing) the name of the fic series is A Visitor Their Dreams. . The other 1 is a crossover between another Sunburn fankid (er fanteen) and I forgot what the name of that fic is,9
,54
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,16
>!Then years later, they have baby boy who then proceeds to push his sister down the stairs!<,60
"Omori 2: Lost In Hunger",26

Thank you,9
: ...(I was asked to babysit Sunny's and Aubrey's daughter, and I found out Mari's has been reincarnated as their daughter. Will she forgive me for faking her death as a suicide?),2

Me too,1
what did he say,1
Yes,1
Yea,1
It’s a joke,25
Why would you think i was a nazi . I'm Jewish,2
protect the mari,24
I meant the appearance...,69
I would not be surprised if there was a light novel or manga somewhere in the world with that exact plot,11
Dude, could you leave the link to the fic, please, since I'm interested in seeing it,7
Oh man that sunny chapters end made me remember final duet and made cry just.... Wow just putting that song into good context just makes me so sad,18
Man, it was fun writing that fic.,15
Thank you for linking this wholesome overload.  :),11
The link doesn’t work 😭,2
It's gone,2
“Learn from your mistake”,27
foolish of you to assume Sunny >!wouldn't avoid houses with more than one floor after that!<,17
This idea was the head canon idea I had while playing Omori with my friend,6
I thought Sunny just beat the crap out of Basil and sent him to the hospital,6
Sunny used all the money he got from working during those last 3 days to buy an elevator,9
Probably something about Aubrey trying out sunny d,3
ok,16
bro you said a swastika is based shut up,1
Original writer deleted their account sadly,2
[,2
The past repeats,9
Problem is, in the fanfic SUNNY re-buys his old house to live with Auby (atleast I think),2
he said something about sunny uh.... . doing the same thing to little mari as he did to mari. . bad comment,6
for a sec i thought you ment the drink .\.,4
Based means judging someone because of something that doesn't matter. Or am i just stupid,2
Aw :(,2
Thanks,2
Mari:”ok then how about I give Sunny daughter special power so you can stop make joke about stair and no trauma allowed ?”,3
sunny when will you learn that your actions have consequences,1
Oh I see,2
based means that something is really good,2

Sorry for being a dumbass,7
Actually, its kinda late to say that, but if you enter the link you sent and read, its says that the word "based" is used ironically so much on the internet, so:.  I seen it used ironically and didn't know it was used ironically, making my original comment . an unfunny joke.,2
Ah yes, urban dictionary, the most trustworthy source of information,3
\>keep coping. . there's no saving this one.,0
just be more careful in the future,1
bro its been a month get over it 💀,1
considering its community made yes,1
Yes but i was confused for a while after that,1
Your seriously using urban dictionary as a source?,1
that's not how that works... the actual definition of based is like not caring about opinions other than your own.,0
yes,2
no it's not,1
Bruh,1
yes, yes it is.. . but tbh idk what i expected from a redditor with an avatar who actually downvotes comments.,0
anyways im muting this goodbye,2
no,1

Omori au where Mari was so good at playing piano that she becomes a famous pianist and now plays in various theatres but she thinks her fame and success is so important to her that now she isn't paying attention to Sunny or her friends anyone.(That is my little au story and this art is one of her famous music albums),188
This have possible explanations. . 1. >!Maybe Mari made this before the recital thing!<. 2. >!She make music in the ghost world idk!<. 3. >!She uses tha mistical Ahnk and revives!<. 4. >!All the game is like a movie and the omori gang are actors xd!<,160
For the uninitiated:. . ,56
>!huh. so this would be her future if the accident never happened.!<,43
[Wait, what?](),30
Plastic Love referance?,60
I think this can confirm the headcanon that Sunny and Mari are Asian,21
I can see why she push Sunny too much since she got a reputation to keep.,19
IT’S REAL. . RIGHT FROM OUR LORD AND SAVIOR OMOCAT,19
this looks like something you would actually find in a second-hand store.,6
looks like OMOCAT is a woman of culture because plastic love by mariya takeuchi is a banger,6
Maybe it’s because plastic love randomly got a [music video]() a week ago?,5
No way 😖. Depression album 😫,3
SHES SO PRETTY ASJIDASUIFZSDF HIUADSLx,4

Where can I find this?,23
>!Honestly Mari being a ghost pianist who plays for other ghosts in the Faraway Town cemetery is such a cool concept!!<,148
5. >!It was actually Mari who pushed Sunny, but he wasn't that badly injured because of how short the fall was. It was Basil rushing downstairs and falling on Sunny with his camera in hand that put them both in the hospital. The game ends with Sunny waking up from a coma.!<,71
5. it's an au,4
I believe that it was all a dream,2
What happens if this was all just in sunnys head and he was in a coma for 3 years after he fell down the stairs,12
I immediately thought of that lol,5
Indeed,14
Too many bits and pieces hinting at it to be just headcanon,43
I don't know mate,it's just a little au that I created In my head.,47
sunny's ghost adventures be like,35
>!"I have to tell you something. Mari didn't kill herself. I killed her. I pushed her down the stairs."!<. . >!Mari steps in behind Sunny.!<. . >!"Sunny, what the hell are you talking about?"!<,89
With everyone around them including mari,3
but then she’d be sad :(,6
I mean theres alot of that stuff in ao3,3
FINE I'LL DO IT MYSELF,13

"Uh...A ghost!",23
One of the few "It was all a dream" theories that make the characters lives better,24
I wish there was a fanfic where Past and Future fused,6
So Omari AU but nobody dies,7
Yeah,3
Send me the link whenever you finish creating the first chapter (page if its a comic) of your story,7
Every fanfic writer when the game doesn't have something:,6
Do you want me to help in this?,6
there are actually a couple of them in existence. . The Bridge is one which just was recently completed.. . Lost and Found is another one that's a bit more, I guess comical? It's not exactly *funny* but it is a little bit more light hearted.. . There's also a few where >!Sunny from OMORI travels to a world of the OMARI AU, or vice versa.!< This includes Miracles, I Won't Let Him, Broken Mirror, and Second Chances.,10
OMORI: Encore on AO3, not finished with chap 1 but we are getting there,5
Yeah sure,3
I knew The Bridge and I Won’t Let Him before making this comment, thanks for giving me some others to read!,2
I will read it,3
OMORI: Encore on Ao3, still unfinished but :D,2
Probably new merch,1332
A partnership with Clue of all board games?,509
I’m prepared for disappointment.,884
Its an among us colab,302
maybe we're finally getting the english manga volumes physically?,219
omori kart announcement,96
Omori 2: Mari's Revenge,85
I think it will be merch or probably a side story integrated within Omori,54
Looks like a teaser for a danganronpa game,48
mobile gacha game incoming,43
Copium,66
Can't wait for it to be engineered to be the most disappointing shit possible,49
I don't really want a spinoff. Omori was good as one game, and it had a good ending. We don't need another game,77
Maybe its literally just art you know. Don't get too excited maybe he/she just drew something and wanted to show it off.,76
kinda giving visual novel sprites,17
My brain wants there to be seven portraits/photos so I can make an Undertale reference.. . Anyway.... . NOOOO YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO OBEY ME. . The 6 OMORI portaits:,14
Maybe merch or something Manga related,13
Anyone else think they might look a little older?,13
iiiiits merch bro dont even,8
omori 2: omori omors out,9
Any new official omori art is good 4 me so idc if it's just merch!!!,8
Mortal kombat: omori edition,7
Don’t set your expectations too high & you won’t be disappointed,6
Console update for switch 2 maybe? It's probs just a merch or manga drop tho,8
An anime. (I'll be so pleased),12
,13
I’m spooked 👀 . . Manga paused. . Mari plush release. . Random sus “hack” on Spotify . . Random sus post specifically on the game account and not the Omocat account 👀 . . WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???,6
. . Idk maybe its related to this? I've personally been trying to figure this new album out,7
looks like clue lol,5
IROMO,4
Manga or animation related is my guess,3
THR HAIR LOOKS REALLY DETAILED IDKKKK IM THINKING OMORI ANIME 😭 we already got a manga so it's not too crazy to think,4
A spinoff would be nice. Or a sequel that takes place from the POV of Mari after she died because what we know about her comes from a sugarcoated headspace (built from Sunny’s POV of her) so that would be interesting to jump into.,5
danagnronpa,3
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUNNY THAT WHAT IM ASSUMING ITS ABOUT,3
It's lowkey weird how this coincides with the spotify thing,3
To the many people saying it might be merch, The OMOCAT twitter usually posts merch news, and OMORI game is more-so about the Game, hence the name. This, combined with the Album with spooky ambiance being posted to the OMORI spotify, makes me think this is going to be a scarier sequel.,3
Notice how Sunny has a knife and Maris photo is on the edge and ia gray, and how Basils photo is between them, what does it possibly mean??,8
after that abomination that the manga is I have no hopes left honestly,8
OMOCAT works fast… but OMORI fans work faster.,2
Probably dubbed manga physical,2
Omori gacha game,2
Three two one let’s jam,2
Get ready for dissapointment.,2
omori trading cards take it or leave it,2
Those look like fucking Persona Portraits, chat.,2
What in the danganronpa is this,2
Fortnite collab,2
Weird take: there is sequel potential here. One of the scenes with a certain ghost indicates an afterlife and something much greater to headspace. Theres also some subtle interactions between headspace and faraway town which indicates a sorta greater supernatural phenomena to the game. Perhaps this ghost can't pass on and needs some help. Which I think having a sequel game of the theme of letting go pairs well with acceptance. So while Sunny himself completed this, his friends might not have.,2
Honestly, no idea. Maybe an artbook or something? Also this image reminded me of Persona 4 for some reason.,2
Always bet on nothing, because nothing ever happens,2
god imagine omori updating,2
Could be something nice. Could be something less hype. Could be anything.,2
Looks like a different artstyle.,2
Might be the comic omo is publishing,2
Probably an anime,2
My stupid ass thought this was a persona crossover,2
Rainy Mari endorsement?,2
very danganronpa-esque,2
Omori anime? It would explain how detail the hair is,2
I think it’s a Fortnite collab because Fortnite reshared it on X/Twitter…😭,2
This aged well.,2
It’s definitely just going to be merch ,2
Ok, but like why do people want a spinoff/sequel to omori? The story is wrapped up nicely by the end and I don't think we really need to expand on the game any more,2
new merch maybe? or some kind of collab…,1
What spin off could be even about? I think the story has a good ending,1
TETRO DANGANRONPA OMORI???,1
At least the sunny shadow seems to be heavily inspired on the manga so its probably not a spinoff :<,1
Probably a art book or something (assuming one hasn’t already been released),1
it’s the cast for the OMORI MOVIE guys trust,1
This isn't a silkpost?,1
Omori Company,1
Tbh, I didn't see the subreddit and thought this was something Persona at first. . ~~*so Persona x Omori when?*~~,1
I SAW THAT IM WONDERING WHAT IT IS,1
It doesn’t look like the omori style, I recognize the characters but they look more…. Realistic if you get what I mean )I mean, their hair! It looks more detailed!) I’m hyped!!,1
Don’t get me hyped like that,1
Fortnite collab (joke) But really im guessing this is probably some sort of news related to the manga or something,1
lets go everyone finally we get omori 3,1
Idk. Maybe we’ll find out on Sunday.,1
My guess is a vinyl figure set, like the set of plushies we have now,1
Somebody inform me of what this is once it comes out, please and thank you! 🙏,1
WE FINALLY KNOW SUNNYS COLOR,1
Woah this is so cool,1
Please let this be THE TIME THEY FUCKING GET IT BACK IN THE XBOX STORE ITS BEEN 2 YEARS WITHOUT ANSWERS!,1
oh interesting,1
Its gonna be a western animation tv show like simpsons and family guy,1
OMORI card game,1
THR HAIR LOOKS REALLY DETAILED IDKKKK IM THINKING OMORI ANIME 😭 we already got a manga so it's not too crazy to think,1
0 idea,1
yo yo yo yo now what is this???,1
Anime? new spinoff? Basil's hairstyle seems different...,1
probably an omori anime?,1
Omori: Definitive Edition,1
Don't even slightly get your hopes up, but if it is, then hell yeah,1
Everything good is releasing in the second half of this year.,1
Thought this was a teaser for a new DDLC game for a sec lmfao,1
Looks like something for the manga,1
Based on artstyle, my immediate assumption was an otome/dating game for some reason,1
maybe photo cards?,1
for a moment I thought this was bad apple,1
postcards or something probably,1
Omori anime 👀,1
Doki doki but omori,1
What do you want in the spinoff?,1
Dead by daylight collab/j,1
i hope it is :D,1
Fortnite reposted it,1
OMORI 2.,1
wait wait WAIT WAIT MORE OMORI CONTENT????? OH MY FUCKK- COUNT ME IN--,1
okay hear me out, an omori style fighting game, with the omori combat, it would go hard af,1
Oh god, oh Jess, what are we getting? Is it a new game? Is content of Dreamworld? Is it another song banger? Tell me which days will go by until the next update because I have been inside the white space waiting for something new to come out,1
omori 2: electric boogaloo,1
Praying that the Xbox version stops being delisted so i can buy it and finish it,1
Lol,1
i want to be happy so bad, but i mustn't get my hopes up,1
Tally hall & omori comes back?,1
OMORI anime?,1
The work is good as it is. It doesn't need more, and I think it would be a real shame to make a spin-off. I hope not.,0
Looks like something with the manga artstyle so I'm not getting my hopes up,1
Please god let this not be a manga thing please god let this not be a manga thing please god let this not be a manga thing,1
Hoping (coping) for an omori dating game,1
Isn’t that just promoting the manga or smth?,1
I have little hope for that,0
... probably nothing? 😭,0
what if its fortnite,0
either a mobile game, card game, or NFT's if they decided to be disapointments that day.. . im leaning more onto card game tho.,0
Dementia theory confirmed,0
the omori game acc typically doesn't tease merch, they didn't tease the plushies or vinyl figures,572
Oh my god. This kind of makes sense.,115
omori cluedo would fuck so hard though im already setting aside 100 dollars,25
This was not the Hasbro collab I was hoping for but it's closer than I ever thought it would be and I'd take it anyways,16
I remember writing a scene in my fic where Sunny and Basil or maybe it was Basil and Aubrey played Clue but I had to play Clue all by myself to make sure the moves they made actually made sense xD that would be so neat,2
I would play the heck outta this. :O,1
>!Reverend Green and Colonel Mustard on the stairs with the rope!!<,1
My life motto (kinda): if you don't get excited, you won't be disappointed,309
I swear to god💔😭🙏,73
>!guys, sunny and basil are the impostors. i saw them kill mari by the stairs.!<,124
Nah, definitely a fortnite collab featuring the new slurp joe item and all your favorite omors,46
Sunny Susuki,11
"where". . >!"stairs"!<,7
I will literally recreate the events of omori irl if this happens,9
Sorry, could you explain that? Wdym manga volumes??,44
Kodansha actually announced recently that they got the license for the Omori manga in English but I could see them wanting to do a more formal announcement,8
Kodansha announced a few days ago that omori manga will be printed in English for spring 2026 so honestly this might be what this is about,7
143 suddenly has a different meaning-,11
I think a side story is hoping too much,,,,,18
Something something ultimate pianist,25
DANGANRONPA MENTIONED THAT WAS MY EXACT THOUGHT 💔 ultimate violinist vs ultimate pianist real,10
Yea, they made a fan made danganronpa game video for both UT and omori. Surprisingly, it's more brutal than danganronpa,8
If there was a danganronpa omori fangame I would not be disappointed in the slightest,6
I agree. I'd absolutely love it if Omocat and team make a new game, but I'd rather it be something completely different than Omori's universe if they do. Omori doesn't feel like it has any room for expansion in sequel material,28
i would want a spin off from basils perspective. or the 4 years before sunny went outside.,2
Yeah, if I want continued Omori stories, I got fanfiction for that,1
Awh man… but Sunny’s birthday is coming up so I think it might be something… they are drawn differently kinda if u look at the hair it’s more realistic-lookin. Please please not just be art 😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻,28
The Omori Game Twitter account has never posted art or merchandise though. That’s always either OMOCAT’s account or a specific Omori Merch account.,21
not that hard to just say they,2
Hero and Kel especially!,7
what genre would it even be though..,1
huh? mine has different songs tho. . ,2
fuckass japan exhibition,1
Sunny has a knife because he has a knife in the game. Maris photo is on the edge and is gray because she’s dead. Basils photo being between them means nothing.,14
Exactly my thoughts 😭,2
,2
For me personally I just love it so much that I would enjoy more hehe. It’s like eating dessert but then you are still craving the dessert so you grab some more. Could be a good thing or you could end up with a stomach ache :D . . Guess we will see where this goes!,3
Like, it's not needed, but a Basil Spin-Off could work. Especially since he has the screen time of like, a couple minutes.,5
Maybe they could focus on what happened with the others during the time sunny spended locked up, like an prequel game.,3
. . they had a similar post with the requiem cafe collab,7
Honestly to me it doesn’t rlly look like the manga art style… more like a realistic version their hair looks a lot more detailed…,6
[removed],272
Maybe a pop-up shop??,33
>!who killed mari?!<,89
Same. >!And I guarantee the first thing people wanna know is if Sunny is the killer!<,14
I misread this,1
You should have called me, I love Clue,2
It fits and it's unsetling.,2
I think you just helped me realize why I have chronic anhedonia (inability to derive pleaser or satisfaction), I have disappointment fatigue.,76
and if you never believe, your life will be sad. . from a Silksong beleiver, never doubt, its better to be wrong than to never have cared if you were (atleast in my opinion 😔),25
That’s my thoughts every time Mother 3 is mentioned or anything Earthbound/Mother in general.,47
thats.... kinda sad actually,9
how do you live like this,8
It’s a new kill animation where >!the crewmate gets pushed down the stairs!<,76
And then they vented.,25
Oh god oh no,3
You joke but unironically I wouldn’t mind that.,12
Omori has a manga, being based off of the game. (Still ongoing tho),53
the omori manga,45
We have some news for you,14
i fuck you🤣 i push you i hate you,3
I love Kel,2
Don't worry, I'm a professional at expecting too much and then being dissapointed,15
>!Sunny and Basil would get accused *immediately* if Mari where to die😅(at least by the players)!<,3
It's probably nothing.. . ,32
Yeah… more for hero though in my eyes… he looks like he’s 30 or 40 😭😭,3
Those songs are in this Playlist - just my Spotify is stupid and doesn't show them on the screen for some reason (–,–),2
Eh, fair enough.,1
For me personally, it feels like eating dessert and then going for the worst thing on the plate right after. I don't see a reason to expand on any part of omori. Everything about it is as complete as it needs to be.,1
>! Isn't we already know what happened   !<,1
omocat UPDATING omori? IMPOSSIBLE!!,198
Praying the PC version gets what the console versions got at the very least,94
It was me,22
Me too,24
Shut up beleiver,-9
C'mon Reggie, give us Mother 3,2
Well, the second part is that if the thing that you were meant to be excited for actually happens, you're still happy about it!,7
A finger of the monkey's paw curls.... . Humphrey coral castle mashup poi that takes up a fourth of the map 😈. . ,8
Omg Where can I read it??,15
Y'all just made me happy lmao,16
YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME FR FR 😭😭😭,2
Yeah I thought so too earlier.. Wouldn't be the best huh?,3
I definitely agree it’s perfect as is, but there are ways they could do it and make it decent. Whether or not that will happen though,3
Yeah, we know, but we didn't "see", thats just an idea though, because i cant see an sequel being something more than that.,3
I mean, the switch/console versions of the game are basically just an updated version of the game, am I wrong?,1
there r mods that fix that, works practically the same,47
Wait, the console version got more content ???,10
Yes, I did it like this!,14
How about this instead?,1
Even worse. . A lousy creative mode map and nothing else,6
You can read it on K manga \^\^,17
it's literally garbage unfortunately,7
Yes? I know? I still want it to be available from the getgo for the principal of it. . There shouldn't be a difference between platforms unless it's like Undertale where it's one silly little different. . Not like Omocat did it where she added a bunch of content for console and left PC alone for...Some reason?,70
Spoiler alert  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Bossman hero fight, basil in boss rush, screen borders, new black space 2 stuff,22
That's a joke lads,9
ALR TYSMMMMMMMMMM IMMA GO CHECK IT OUT HEHRHEHEHE,11
Oh ok 😅,3
Tbh that box fight in undertale is so very cool that I don't consider it little,22
It's bc consoles are the intended way to play games, so she gave consoles that extra bit they deserve! Plus PCs get mods on everything, while console is always left behind. So honestly, we need this!. . P.S. I'm mainly joking here, don't take this too serious ^^,2
How would I know that you don’t know? It’s not exactly advertised, most people I know are too scared to try modding, I would have liked the stuff to be there by default as well but at least on pc you can still get it. . Like how Minecraft has significantly more benefits on pc because you can mod, doesn’t really matter whats on console if you can get it with relative ease,2
Wtf omocat,17
SPOILER THAT!,4
(Canned laughter),9
Just an FYI, it’s paid after some point,11
it's to incentivize ppl to go back to console gaming so devs and game comms aren't so segregated. Then everyone can get every game instead of being left out just bc they don't have a $1,000+ PC for steam and mods :3c. . (I completely pulled this outta my ass, but it's a nice thought),10
It was *buurp* him 🫵,2
Yeahh... Just saw, I'll try anyways. Thanks!,4
its the same reason why undertale has some console exclusive stuff like mew mew in the switch version and the dog shrine being different in every port,2
(Gasp) How did you know?,3
I've been reading it free  [Here](),14
Thank you very much!,5
[deleted],199
Wouldn’t it be so cool if there was a fighting card game where you could play as all of these characters?. *wink wink*,246
There's soooo many games that can be added here, and to think that all of these games were inspired by Earthbound...,62
Who’s the one with glasses?,63
No Russell from End Roll :c  . Cool art though.,43
Can someone make a list with all the games these characters are from? I recognize a few but I'm curious about the others,40
wait, people actually remember ninten?,70
Brad had it worst. . Ness had it best. . Sunny is in the middle,24
Who's the guy with the moon head?,16
Epic,12
They ready to [check their enemy's stats] then beat some ass!,11
I was thinking about something I would draw kinda like this!!,8
I badly want Sunny in Smash Bros. I mean an they got Steve from Minecraft,8
THIS LOOK SO COOL :),6
Can you guys name all, I'm looking for games to play lol,6
The gang's all here.,7
It's good to see Brad there, amazing game,6
its fun to see this on OFF'S 14th anniversayr,5
what are all the games,6
Wayne looks really hungover,4
Who is Glasses Girl? And what about that cursed prince lemon thing at the top?,4
And all these people are amazing..  . Except you batter..  . Fuck you batter.,3
Wayne and Sunny would be weirdo pals,4
Forgot charlotte,4
you need therapy squad,4
No alex yiik 0/10,5
Once again I am sad that no one knows about SUITS.,4
He is not there, but I recommand a lot Jimmy from the game "Jimmy and the Pulsating Mass". It's so good. 😁,3
Aww, I wish Lea was there. But I understand it wouldn't fit.,3
Rpg rave,3
Who are the ones at the top besides Niko?,3
Please let me know who are all the characters so I can play their games,3
Super smash bros, nickelodeon All Star Brawl, Multiversus..... . . Now we just need a fighting game with these characters 👀,3
From front to back, it went from human child to borderline biblically accurate angel,3
Keep Niko away from Sunny at all cost,3
where's alex yiik from yiik: the postmodern rpg,7
I've only played seven of these, definitely slacking,2
AAAA THEYRE ALL SO CUTEEEEEEEE AAAA,2
[removed],2
No Hello Charlotte :(,2
Isn't the person below Sunny the guy from LISA,2
The based squad,2
Niko's here!,2
alex,2
Ness, omori, frisk, Lisa guy (💀💀💀), Kris, Niko,2
awesome art!. . there is 1 character missing,1
L no Everhood D:,1
Where hollow knight,-1
OneShot's not an RPG, it's a puzzle/adventure game. As confirmed by the creators.. Otherwise nice art.,-3
NIKO!,1
Yoo they even got Temmie's Lost Girl!,1
I need every game present in this picture,1
666 upvotes!,1
Chara,1
Question. . Who is the *probably gender neutral* character below Kris?,1
Where chrono,1
poor Charlotte she couldn't make it,1
you forgot to add freddy fuckboy from five nights at fuckboys (real) /j,1
what's the top yellow one?   . . . ik all the others; ninten, ness, lucas, frisk, madotsuki, brad, the batter, sunny, kris, niko, and lonely girl,1
This is the most amazing piece of fan art I’ve ever seen!,1
No Alex YIIK, this clearly isn’t finished /s,1
‘Mazing Art. A chef’s kiss.,1
lonely girl real,1
I like how they’re in the same sort of order they came out,1
I love how I have no idea who half of these people are,1
I wonder if To The Moon also counts, haha.,1
Who is the baseball man, the dude above kris and the dude on top. . . And the name of their games,1
No Alex Yiik,1
WAYNE,1
clean is loading,1
Earthbound (plan on playing (started a bit)). . Undertale (played). . Deltarune (Played). . Omori (plan on playing). . Yume Nikki (played, but never finished because of a missing file). . One Shot (never played). . these are the games I know here,1
No Charlotte i will cry :(,1
Man I’d do anything to play any of these games for the first time again,1
The quirky earthbound inspired RPG/RPGMaker game people,1
all earthbound drawings should look like the graphics. . cute,1
Lucas, Ness, Ninten, Madotsuki, Brad Armstrong, Frisk, Kris, Sunny, Batter, protagonist of Escaped Chasm, idk the character at top, Niko,1
But where is Alex Eggleston from YIIK: A Postmodern RPG?,1
Virginity squad,1
what game is the batter from?,62
The Batter is probably the coolest character to come out of RPG Maker,41
I haven't personally played it, but [pepper steak]() will always be stuck in my head no matter what happens.  . . . Love that surrealist shit.,23
yeah good to see OFF again,5
I hope it wouldn't be cancelled! *wink wink*,129
Am I right to assume that you're winking because you're making a game with just that?,10
Actually contrary to popular belief, some of these games are not inspired by Earthbound. The best example being OFF, as Mortis Ghost, the creator of the game, had not yet played the mother series until after the release of OFF (Fun fact, Mortis has said that if he did play the Mother games before making OFF, the ending to OFF would have definitely have been different). . But what we can say is that Earthbound did affect the RPG landscape, allowing creators to make things that are not part of the norm,43
The protagonist from Escaped Chasm by Temmie Chang. . I'd highly recommend the game,108
That's the Main protagonist of the game Escaped Chasm, a short RPG game made by Temmie Chang, Undertale's primary artist.,16
Only because 5 people have ever played that game (myself included),8
The 3 Jimmy and the pulsating mass fans are also sad,5
Top to Bottom and Left to right:. Wayne(Hylics), idk their name(Escaped Chasm),Niko(OneShot), Kris (Deltarune), OMORI(OMORI), The Batter (Off), Madotsuki (Yume Nikki), Brad (Lisa), Frisk (Undertale),Lucas (Mother 3), Ness (Mother 2), Ninten (Mother),84
This is who I I think I know at least from top to bottom:. . Yellow crescent guy: Wayne from Hylics. Glasses girl: protag from escaped chasm. Cat character: niko from Oneshot. I’ve completely no idea who the boy with brown hair is 🤔🤔🤔. Kris from deltarune. The batter from OFF. Madotsuki from Yume Nikki. Brad from Lisa: The hopeless. Frisk from Undertale.  And finally we’ve got the eastbound gang: Lucas, Ness, and Ninten,11
The mother representation is so nice to see lol,36
Sunny had it terrible. Probably 2nd worst.,13
brad did indeed have it worst, im backing you up broski,13
Wayne had it fucking radical,10
At least he got to live in joy at the end of all things...,2
Wayne from the game Hylics. It is a very badass game and I'd recommend checking it out!,31
Top to Bottom and Left to right:. Wayne(Hylics), idk their name(Escaped Chasm),Niko(OneShot), Kris (Deltarune), OMORI(OMORI), The Batter (Off), Madotsuki (Yume Nikki), Brad (Lisa), Frisk (Undertale),Lucas (Mother 3), Ness (Mother 2), Ninten (Mother). . . The funny thing Is all of these games are good.,9
I highly recommend OMORI, Off, Yume Nikki, EarthBound and Mother 3,5
Top to Bottom and Left to right:. Wayne(Hylics), idk their name(Escaped Chasm),Niko(OneShot), Kris (Deltarune), OMORI(OMORI), The Batter (Off), Madotsuki (Yume Nikki), Brad (Lisa), Frisk (Undertale),Lucas (Mother 3), Ness (Mother 2), Ninten (Mother),4
Cursed banana head man is Wayne from Hylics and Glasses girl is the protagonist of Escaped Chasm.,8
I mean frisk and kris depend, as well as brad. Actually nevermind brad is forced to commit genocide to beat the game,3
Brad is the bad guy bro,3
The Batter is the coolest character here lol,5
Wth do you mean? Batter Is the best character.,1
I still can't beleive more people haven't played it. . suits absolute power was lit too,1
"pyroplaycrosscodepls" xd,2
Top to Bottom and Left to right:. Wayne(Hylics), idk their name(Escaped Chasm),Niko(OneShot), Kris (Deltarune), OMORI(OMORI), The Batter (Off), Madotsuki (Yume Nikki), Brad (Lisa), Frisk (Undertale),Lucas (Mother 3), Ness (Mother 2), Ninten (Mother),4
Top: Wayne from Hylics. . Glasses Girl: Lonely Girl from Escaped Chasm. . Guy you know: Sunny from Omori. . Catperson: Niko from OneShot. . Blue person: Kris from Deltarune. . Man with cap: The Batter from OFF. . Bald man: Brad from LISA the Painful. . Bike Girl: Madotsuki from yume nikki. . Kid with pink and blue shirt: Frisk from Undertale. . Bottom three: Lucas, Ness and Ninten from the MOTHER series.,3
Brad and kris are in muggen,1
He was too intelligent and too much of a hypster to want to stand near those, as he called them, "plebs",6
Do not speak of he who shall not be named here, foolish mortal,5
Wayne from Hylics, Brad from LISA THE PAINFUL, Madotsuki from Yume Nikki, The Batter from OFF, Niko from One shot, and the lonely girl from Escaped Chasm.,5
Yes,1
brad arms are stronk,1
is it Charlotte ?,2
It's not RPG or RPGmaker,2
It's not an Rpg, it's a metrodivania,5
She's from Yume Nikki,3
apparently wayne from hylics, for the longest time i also had no idea who he was,2
Not really, hylics was before Deltarune,1
which do you know?,1
The baseball Guy is the batter from OFF, the yellow guy is wayne from Hylics and the girl is from escaped chasm,2
[deleted],84
OFF,25
OFF The Game,6
Cake,4
He's cool but:. . >"You don't have to die today old man". . "No. You're wrong". . >"What?". . "I've been dead for 35 years". . "Today is the day I live",25
Ha, idk how it even could get canceled. So far I’ve made Madotsuki, OMORI, The Batter, Kris, Lucas, Ninten, Niko and a few other OMORI characters.,80
Are you guys talking about that The Binding of Isaac spinoff game or something?. . I wonder if it got cancelled due to copyright concerns.,14
Wait what game were you thinking of?,1
it’d have a LISA character in it so itd be doomed to get cancelled,1
To say I’m making a *game* may be pushing it, rather I’m taking a pre-existing, very cool card game called Unmatched and have been working for months on making tons of custom playable indie rpg characters in it. Many of them are already finished.,20
Did Mortis say how the ending would have been different? I really needed to watch those streams they spoke in.,3
I feel like I really missed something with that game. To me, you just kinda walked around and then it just ended, right when I thought it was starting.,30
Thank you kind stranger,16
... That's actually Sunny from Omori, not Omori from Omori.,27
Small correction: Brad is from Lisa the Painful (and technically Joyful). Hopeless is a fangame.,3
Thanks!,1
I think brad was the one who had it the most worst,2
very late but Lucas had It really bad for very spoilery reasons,1
Yeah honestly Wayne had it best. Beat up a tyrant and uhhh become toothepaste I guess? But he seems into it so it's ok,11
idk if living as a joy mutant is a very nice exsistence i think id rather die,0
The battle visuals there are so obscure and . gorgeous, especially those “hand” animations in the second game.,16
what rabbit hole did i just stumble into. will look into it, thx,8
And Lisa. I hate the Lisa community, but man the game Is truly amazing and everyone on this subreddit would probably enjoy It.,7
Don't forget Deltarune :),2
Oh yeah, I remembered seeing her from somewhere, I just couldn't find what it was. Never heard of Pluto's twice removed cousin.,4
Wayne: . . Niko:. . Ninten: . . Ness: . . Lucas:,2
How dare you,2
>!It’s Sunny not Omori!<,3
everybody here sleepin on lisa,1
no, pokemon trainer. . ive never heard of charlotte,-3
it's an RPG? just not an RPGmaker game,1
Oh, ok. My bad,2
Thanks!,1
hm, i've never heard of hylics before,1
Downloaded, TY,24
Have you played OFF tho? All of the Batter's lines are cool af, instead of just one at the end of the game,3
Oh sorry I thought u were talking about another thing,41
I know asking for characters for fighting games is really cringy, but please add Phillip from space funeral . . Have one of his moves be him pulling a straw out and latching on to the other character,9
well there’s Brad from LISA: The Painful up there so it’s chances of getting canceled are through the roof,5
Nope, not too many people know about what I’m talking about yet haha,22
Is there a Tboi fighting game or are you talking about IRULE?,1
Idk, I think that's was called indie game mashup,1
Oh pog, I'll have to check it out.,2
I think he said something along the lines of the game not having such a depressing ending, but something more akin to Mother 3's ending,5
It has a sequel game called Dweller’s Empty Path that it was a setup for. As I understand it DEP is more of a game.,31
yeah, is a short game,9
It’s only known because it’s made by Temmie Chang,2
I always have to push for my faves haha, Off, OMORI and Yume Nikki are really great. I am also, as I’m sure you can tell by my username, a huge fan of the bottom 3 games lol,19
Yeah I figured it didn’t sound right but was too lazy to double check lol,2
I just realized someone did it before me, whoops,2
Do you see my username,3
Lightning is still 👌,2
What's wrong with the Lisa community?,2
I'm playing Lisa rn tbh,2
I actually did play Deltarune and really did enjoy it,2
You are right I Copypasted another comment. I guess we are just so used to omori as the main charachter, he Is usually the one that gets all the non-spoiler fan art comment,4
It's as much of an rpg guitar hero,0
good game hylics 2 is also fire,1
Q “Look… he has your eyes…”. . . B(now alone) “They are full of fear.”,10
Ha no worries, I haven’t ever ready posted about my project, so there’s no reason you’d know about it. Idk where I would post about it really,46
What another thing?,3
i agree considering the ammount of lisa projects that were canned,1
Good to know,1
Hype? Hype. Hype!,15
?,2
I’ll be putting out info about how to play the RPG maker characters in a couple of week,3
that would've been interesting, but personally I do like Off's ending. >!I think a redemption arc for The Batter would've been a little too goofy. There's something satisfying and very in character for The Batter never changing his ideals throughout the game.!<,3
bit harsh, but it's true it doesn't really fit in with the others- it's like 10 minutes long, with maybe five rooms total. kinda unfair to put it next to friggin omori, lol.,3
Yep, from your username I figured you did,5
It's okay it's still useful :],1
fr dawg what we do wrong,3
have you like actually played it? if yume nikki is an rpg then everhood surely is too. there's plot, you explore different locations, do quests, meet cool characters, it's from a top down jrpg perspective, it has the rpg tag on steam, like idk what do you want from it lol why cant it be an rpg,1
it looks trippy asf,1
Yeah, that's one of his lines, not my favourite but ok,1
Should have expected this from EarthBoundFan3,15
Card Saga Wars probably,4
Are you interested? It’s not some official game or anything, just a fan project but it is playable on Table Top Simulator,10
Psst. I have put out some teasers for you and anyone else who comes across this and may be interested.,1
Nice. Where can I get the game?,2
Normally I define an RPG as a game where you preform different commands to go against a set goal of some sort after a given "go" sign, like OFF's meters or Mario and Luigi's blocks,1
Oh for real? That's one of my favorites personally. Do you have a particular line you like?,1
Classic EarthBoundFan3,6
Yea totally! Regardless of it being official or fanmade, it's still a great concept,9
Looking awesome so far, can't wait to see what other gimmicks the rest of the characters have!,2
Please show,1
Table Top Simulator is the best way. You can play with the official characters that way as well as fan made ones, like the RPG Maker ones I’ve made.. The physical, official game you can buy from game stores. It’s called Unmatched.,6
what about pokemon,1
(I just realized that my previous comment sounds a bit dry, sorry for that). . I'm obsessed with the setup to the first battle in the game, walking into an empty room and stating:. . > Show yourselves, corrupted children. I am the voice of forgiveness that will eliminate your calamitous forms.. . And suddenly be surrounded by enemies. Then, looking at the screen, he drops my favourite line:. . > Prepare yourselves to suffer my judgement.. . And you hear that awesome battle theme for the first time.. . . I also must say the dialogue you quoted is also great, it's scary how confident he is in what he's about to do,6
Where should I post about it?,6
psst again, I have posted how to get involved!,1
Check my posts,1
Nice, I'll probably do the former then.,2
The end of the opponents turn, to work towards depleting the health bar,1
>This zone, deprived of its guardian, is now destined to disappear.... . >And the men who live here, whether they deserve it or not, will fall into nothingness, never to return.,5
Hmmm, I dunno. Maybe post about it on each of the games' subreddits, with the respective references to their games? Also, maybe link a post to your profile detailing everything in general? Idk just suggestions,3
I'll be honest I'm still not exactly sure what you're talking about, sorry.,1
Thank you, I love reading OFF quotes,1
Sweet ty, I will do smth like that. I hope you look forward to seeing more about this soon! Probably in 2 weeks.,5
Haha definitely setting up a reminder for it!,2
Winter 2014?,2
LOL, I will try not to make people wait that long,2
it takes so slow that we going back in time? god damn,2
Reference to the Mother 4 fan game project, original release date was 8 years ago 🤦‍♂️,1
ohhhhh. . culture moment ,2
I always loved how cartoony and chibi the game characters were yet the backgrounds are almost always hyper realistic. It gets me everytime.,796
I love this game so much,538
i love aubrey's birthday art. theres a lot to analyze. why is she jumping a fence?,274
[deleted],153
It's funny how much she has grown   ,78
Why did I think that was a beach with a canal in the background?,58
Quality posts like these are few and far between these days. . . You tickled my brain thank you,29
i swear there is like an infinite supply of random little details to discover in this game,30
Omori’s art style always gives me second-hand nostalgia.,20
little off topic but basil ready to catch her is so adorable. not in a ship way but in a genuinely adorable kid moment ,20
Kel looks like he's about to commit some goofy acts,18
a same place. . &#x200B;. . maybe AUBREY's house?,17
this image made me come to the realization i didn’t tag a single person in faraway,13
OMORI:. . - Cartoony character. . - Hyper realistic background. . - Somehow works perfectly. . The amazing world of Gumball:. . - Cartoony character. . - Hyper realistic background. . - Somehow works perfectly. . . . Coincidence? I think… yes?,14
I wonder if this is a real life photo, and where it was sourced if so,11
Sunny canonically likes Chocolate ice cream lads,8
Time to get rainbolt to find out where this is,8
It’s probably a house in whatever town Omocat lives/lived in when she was making omori,5
godfuck,4
Get the geoguesser dude NOW,3
COME ON GUYS LETS GO!!!!,3

OMORI fandom on their way to find that specific house:,3
They neatly stuffed the game full of details.,2
Damn kids stealing my apple from mah tree!,2
They look so goofy in the birthday art i luv it,2
Why did I think this was going to be an americ anfootball reference?,2
Kel ligit went goblin mode,2
Wait that art is cannon?!. . I didn’t know! I love it even more 😭. . Like the fact that BASIL tries to help her get down while SUNNY’s just watching and eating his ice cream, and KEL just being KEL… we need more of those please,2
Do you have theories? Tell me,2
Bro there's a tag ability IRL?,2
i wonder if that guy who finds places can find where this image was taken,2
love it,2
as for the third image, *we all float down here!*,2
I love the dynamic here. .  (worried for her safety). .  (looks around for anyone watching). .  (ice cream),2
Funny how occasionally, somebody notices a detail lke this.,2
what the HELL is kel doing 😭😭,2
the background looks like a haunted mound album cover,1
and it somehow works so nicely and doesn't feel unnatural imo,293
Yeah, top-tier compositing,7
Perfect response. Same here 🥹,192
shes tryna get to every1 else,122
i love how basil looks like he's trying to make her less scared, saying he'll catch her. kel looks like he's just egging her on, and sunny is just a watcher. absolutely love it,24
Breaking and entering,2
I love how Kel kinda looks the lookout or something, making sure they don't get caught, meanwhile Sunny's just "guys if you just shut up and act like this is normal no one's gonna know". And Basil's definitely offering to catch her.,3
Probably sneaking out. Sunny's just trying to act normal while Kel is on the lookout and Basil is ready to catch her. But Aubrey isn't looking at Basil which probably means she wants Kel or Sunny to catch her instead because Basil wouldn't be strong enough ,3
she's escaping,3
Why isn't Sunny wearing any shoes? Why is there mold in his armpit?,2
OH MY GODDD,35
the details in the game 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,9
I looked and I don’t see it?,3
I did too dw,14
glad my weird ability to catch the most obscure of details has paid off. i love finding out more about this game,4
the game was packed with so much love and care and it shows,2
Shame what their relationship turns into,7
Iirc there's only a single area in Faraway where you can tag your party members.,10
considering the 2 different camera angles of the same place, it's probably an image omocat/her team took themselves,3
He apparently likes biting it too,2
The Omori twitter acc posts that stuff every now and then and for the characters' birthdays'.   . . . There's a comic for Aubrey and Sunny's first birthdays too.,6
The Amazing World of Gumball moment,218
It just seems like a natural part of the art style.,32
I beg to differ. It's kinda creepy.. . But It does give off a special art style. So It can pass,25
Well obviously but why in that way,29
its awesome 😭 i imagine basil trying to catch her and then proceeding to get squashed,5
I don't think that's mold. Based on what it looks like Sunny is most likely wearing a tank top, which is sleeveless. Sometimes the holes where the sleeves would go are long, so the "mold" is most likely just the side of his torso shadowed.. . I have no idea why he's not wearing shoes tho-,3
Hes wearing flip flops and its just the shading of his torso,3
Oh my god, it's just darkness and woods I could've sworn there was a fence in the background! I'm sorry, I just spread misinformation, apparently ,5
,5
That’s what I was thinking as well,1
Yeah the picture of just the fence without hero and aubrey is very uncanny valley,10
imo the creepiness adds to the game positively, which fits its storyline,7
Based on what we know about Aubrey's mom, she's probably sneaking out,125
sneaking out when you don’t actually have to is a very kid thing to do,63
her mom? i was thinking her dad,34
Considering her parents and the lore i think it's something she had to do,42
Could be, tbh I don't know much about Aubrey,31
We dunno too much about her parents in general, besides her dad being gone and her mom being presently basically an invalid, seemingly due to drinking. The people in the background in the church fight comment that the loss of her father is why she's so "uncontrollable" now, so that has led to the perception that her father was the more commanding type, and that she might have had to work around him to hang out with everyone at times, if only for certain days.,25
Or she could be uncontrollable because she’s behaving badly as a way to cope with her grief and anger over her father leaving - that is the most obvious explanation, not that her father controlled her more,2
Kind of a late reply to my comment, but people's perceptions of her in-universe are what I was going off of there. The people in the church directly equate her father leaving with her becoming uncontrollable, and explicitly don't spare her any sympathy in their commentary, so assuming they're being empathetic toward her is no less presumptive in context. Plus, the idea of a parent being controlling is hardly a foreign one, nor especially unrealistic. We explicitly have multiple examples in-universe with Mari and Sunny's dad being known to be the type to get mad if Mari was seen being too close to Hero, and Kel and Heros mom is on the more demanding side as well. Plus there are side characters like Kim and Vances mom who are similar, so the concept is clearly reiterated. Not to say they're all bad parents, mind, Kel and Heros mom is alright, and we know barely anymore about Sunnys dad than we do about Aubrey's. And just to be clear, being controlling and being abusive are not being conflated here; I'm only arguing that we have some evidence that may support a reading of them as being on the demanding, controlling side of things, not that they're abusive control freaks or anything.. . The point, both of my first paragraph here and my comment further up, is this is the only info we have, and so people infer different potential meanings behind it. I was explaining the mindset that conveyed people's assumptions about him, not stating that he absolutely must've been as such. We know people in the church connect his leaving to Aubrey's uncontrollability, and the birthday picture seems to show her having to sneak out of her birthday to go with friends. Given her mom is found as a comatose drunk, people then determine that perhaps it was her father who led to her having to sneak out and in turn have the churchgoers that impression.,2

Perfect crossover,1
But to my knowledge N is not gay? For Christ sake he had a big crush on V for like 3 to 4 episodes before Uzi managed to get him to think for himself... and even this is just the classic bullies will say dumb shit without reason, this would still be inaccurate because N as the idiot he is would either smile and say thank you or give a disappointed stare and say that's not nice depending on how far in the series timeline we're talking about.. . That said V definitely belong on the bully side of things.,1
N is not gay.. . He was three girlfriend in murderdrones.... . WHO IS HE GAY FOR?!?!?,1
Where is the right one from?,1
Now I get that I might get stoned from this, but AUBREY and Susie from Deltarune aren't really that similar. Sure they do have a certain level of similarity, like how both >!are suggested to come from troubled backgrounds, and both have rough personalities!<, but there are still some differences:. . * >!AUBREY feels like her friends weren't there for her when MARI died, but Susie likely has self-esteem issues and thinks that no-one is worthy of her friendship, and she takes that out on Kris!<. * >!AUBREY, despite being passive, still isn't open yet to the friend group, judging by the fact that she still frowns and doesn't seem to interact positively with them (judging by the fact that she slaps KEL, grabs HERO by the ear and nervously shows her elbow to SUNNY in their respective tag polaroids), and after chapter 1, Susie just mysteriously chooses to behave nicely with Kris, ignoring the fact that she's been bullying them and pushing them around ever since she came to hometown!<. * >!AUBREY is generally serious when she talks in the game, Susie has a largely ironic attitude and almost always speaks in jest. !<,1

“Bullying is ok if its feminist”. . . . /jk ik thats not what you meant,248
But it's the opposite of fun messing with Basil. Draw every character on this image telling him everything is gonna be ok while crossdressing, they're way cooler than the gang that neglects and drowns him, I don't care if the vampire nazi robots are here/hj,2
What does that even mean❓,11

They're from Murder Drones, its an indie animated series on Youtube.,7

Granted, Ralsei should start being assertive and stand up for himself (same thing applies to Noelle), but why do you want Susie to bully him so much?,3
Aubrey isn’t lesbian,1

I don't like seeing this. Your crossover art heavily reminds me of those gender-related double standards. 😟,1

Thad,1
Doesn't Aubrey punch Kel in one of the pictures from Faraway Town?,2
None of the characters are all that similar- V, the last girl at the top, is literally a murder robot designed by a company to kill other robots (she does still have personality and stuff of course). I was referring to the archetype of "lesbian stereotype bullies gay stereotype" as a joke and not much else.. This however was helpful as I have learned a bit more about Susie lol,1
It's from an animated show thing on YT called Murder Drones,1
Thank you for adding /j to your post. When I first saw this, I was horrified. How could anybody say something like this? I immediately began writing a 1000 word paragraph about how horrible of a person you are. I even sent a copy to a Harvard professor to proofread it. After several hours of refining and editing, my comment was ready to absolutely destroy you. But then, just as I was about to hit send, I saw something in the corner of my eye. A /j at the end of your comment. Suddenly everything made sense. Your comment was a joke! I immediately burst out in laughter at the comedic genius of your comment. The person next to me on the bus saw your comment and started crying from laughter too. Before long, there was an entire bus of people on the floor laughing at your incredible use of comedy. All of this was due to you adding /j to your post. Thank you.,37

hilariously yet sad, if the gender roles were to be reversed the relationship would considered to be very controversial,17
Two words: Double Standards.,11
It means that females rank higher socially and usually bully the males, even if the males are usually stronger physically. This is especially shown well in hyaena packs. Look it up to get more insight into the life of a hyaena male. Back when humans were much closer to wild animals that was also true for us.,4
I was into both these things for the longest time but I also feel you rn,2

Thad only appeared twice in the series and N never showed him any emotion.... . Hell the scenes that thad appears in are the scenes were N is not on screen and vice versa.... . N has a crush on uzi, is secretly in love with V, and is the love interest of tessa,1
Exactly, you won't see Susie being that antagonistic in deltarune,1

I love heroooo this is great,2
While I agree, since I'm in full blown "saving cool artwork until your hard drive can't contain anything else" mode, I noticed that it's Kel that's sorely missing artistic representation. A real shame, considering how many fun situations he could be in art-wise and how important he is to the story.,25
Ahh! Yup! They are, Dm me! \^\^  Thank you for commenting all the time!!!,56
He sure is! :D,28
Hilariously, I was originally going to have his eyes closed only, but then I went hmm I wonder... and accidentally drew him with them eyes 😂,30
I'm sorry!!! Please don't die,15
Ahhh thankyou!! Tho I owe it to hero for being so charming 😅,14
Ahh thankyou!! I look forward to seeing your comments there :),12

I FKFJSJKFKDKGKF I SHALL TRY TO SURVIVE. . BUT I HAVE A REQUEST. . I POLITELY ASK HERO TO MAKE ME A CHOCOLATE CAKE. . HE COULD DO THAT I THINK I MEAN PUT HIM IN A KITCHEN AND HE’LL MAKE EDIBLE ART,11

Omorune is the best fandom crossover ever,132
Where’s Kris’s knife?,85
Dawg why does Sunny look like he’s about to crash out 😭😭😭,52
"Omori did not succumb.",17
I love how both of them have a murderous mini counterpart,15
They’re plotting something and I don’t know what that is… *But they’re plotting’ something alright…*,15
Mini Kris: You like this violence don't you?. . Meanwhile Omori: Kys,13
8-Bit Kris has the Power Croissant. We are all doomed.,5

OH NO! THE PLUSHIES ARE ALIVE! 😨. . . . PD: nice drawing btw,6
Attack of the killer plush.,3
the 8 bit kris solos,3
Unrelated, but these birds are pissing me off. I am the original      starwalker,3
Cute overload,2
just give them hero's cookies and no one gets hurt.,2
This is so good lol,1
Snowgrave players be like,134
"Hey, Noelle, check out my Tainted Lillith cosplay!",95
"GIVE ME YOUR EXP!",17
Kris tries to do the "Stinger" move from Devil May Cry,6
I need this gif btw lmao,6
"Let me at her! Let me at her!",1
Kel took Sunny's so he "borrowed" Kris' knife earlier,80
We stole it,18
They may be smol, but it is the trauma demon that told them to kill themself lol,52
I mean... Reasonable?? Omori is a dream creature, but mini-Kris is like actually real,21
He was dealing with his inner demon, now he deals with it but carried by another quirky knife carrying silent teenager's demon.. . "Preppare for trouble". "And make it double",8
He knows how well-received Kris' crashout was compared to his own,1
snick,6
\*But Kris refused.,1
No, you’re Sunny, you silly duck!,2
Binding of Isaac mentioned?!!,28
Peaking of Peaksaac mentioned?!!,10
(a few days late but ignore that). . given the nature of dark worlds it’s kinda shaky, but i guess mini-Kris can straight up kill them so it’s real enough,1
It's him,3
,406
Stay away from here until you finish the game, Omori fans can't restrain themselves from spoiling the entire game.,256
Guys y'all are scaring me,478
,260
*\*laughs maniacally\**,183
I'm gonna spoil something for you: He is still alive at the end of every route in the game and has a perfectly happy life at the end of every one too. You have nothing to worry about. Hope you enjoy the game,275
[deleted],72
I now know to never, ever trust an OMORI fan with a secret,52
Babil ,36
Ah, I was the same when I started this game too! He's the first character I actually liked, the others took a bit to grow on me. . . Anyways, leave this subreddit, it's filled with people who will intentionally or unintentionally spoil you for a joke. Things happen in the game. Play it and don't come back until you're done.,34
Please, OP, for the sake of your very first playthrough and the emotional impact it will have on you, mute this subreddit for a while. You WILL get spoilers, and Basil is a super important character.,34
have fun......,27
 fellow basil appreciator,24
[removed],62
you guys gotta chill with all the indirect spoilers,41
He's a good boy. A fine boy. One of the best.,34
how far are you in?,15
Yup amazing community as always, full of spoiling assholes.,14
I Love basil omg hiiii,14
He is, in fact, baby. Also, I'd be careful reading comments here, as someone who's played the game inside and out on Steam since it's release, people like to spoil things.. . Don't worry. The Basil you currently know will be just fine. ,12
I  genuinely laughed lmao thanks,10
This gets reposted every 5 minutes,8

Cant go 2 comments into this thread without coming across an indirect spoiler... Omori fans have absolutely no restraint,4
he do be pretty op with those vines,3

I would not be on this sub if you haven't finished the game yet if I were you. It really is an experience worth... experiencing yourself.,3
It's awesome how there's more ppl playing the game now!,3
HAHAHAHAHA. please unsub till you're done with the game, it's really hard to avoid spoilers here.,3
My favorite is kel but basil is a close second,2
Good luck with that :),2
Basil is absolutely precious,2

Exactly my sentiment when I first saw him. He was so cute and how he dealt with boss was amazing and his flower hobby was so wholesome. Not only did it reminded me of Jun from Persona 2, I actually am now pondering, if I also should start taking care of Flowers and pursuing a hobby of making photos.. . Basil made my life better and I cannot repay that!,2
Just gonna say, probably avoid any fandoms till you beat the game (there are 2 main endings). Likely to get spoiled,2
....,2
 i also like basil!!!,2
let us know your opinion when you finish,,2
How about you all leave them alone if you hate Basil.. Just Ignore them, be civil guys. I'm not really that interested in Basil, but It's annoying. Also comments that say "I'd be happy without Basil","I'd punt Basil into space", How original. If you think I'm mad, I'm not. Just annoyed. 50% of this community is worse than the school in HC2,2
!remindme 1 week,2
When I started the game, I honestly thought he's a girl.. . Still is a pretty adorable femboy with that flower crown.,2
YEE ONE MORE FOR THE BASIL FANCLUB,3

,1
JUst like me,1
I know I commented this last time this was posted here, but this was also me when I started playing the game,1
"I would kill everyone in this room and then myself" mfs when I kill the subject in question from outside the room (I have caused a genocide while remaining unharmed myself ),1
,1
yeah hes cool,1
I will punt basil,1
Glad you're enjoying the game so far! I just suggest avoiding this subreddit for now as there are **a lot** of spoilers.,1
my friend we are the same I made and posted this exact same meme when I startedd,1
crazy how you made this BEFORE you reach the end. but yeah, stay away from the sub till you finish the game. ppl on here suck sometimes,1

All I'm gonna say is that I recommend you to open the door every single time on your first play through,1
I beleive in basil supremacy ,1

Omori fans try not to spoil the entire fucking game to someone who would've otherwise enjoyed a perfectly blind playthrough,84
,276
It's okay. You gonna love him at the end too. Probably.,162

Poor soul pls tell us if you enjoyed the game after you beat it,50

I finished the game and I still love him.,36

Yeah I don't think you should be around the sub if you don't want to get spoilered in case, just saying,11

Tip: Don’t leave him unattended.,1
Remember to water the plants if you want to see the true ending,1
 dw abt it,1
hes a terrible human being start hating him or you'll feel way worse about yourself in the end,1
Ok so everyone is reacting with this face and now I'm getting worried lol,236
why though...,95

You did it ,23
,15
Ho god! 🥲,3
I agree. I see a lot of puns here. They alone aren't so bad, but the reactions of other commenters heavily imply that there's deeper meaning to the puns. I mean it's just safer all around to spoiler tag stuff.,16
I’m sorry but it ain’t happening, omori fans love making indirect spoilers. They will continue to hang around whether you like it or not,4
It's OP's own fault for even coming here in the first place. If they don't want spoilers they should maybe not make a post in a subreddit known for spoiler memes? "You guys gotta chill" like bruh blame OP not the fans lmao.,-2
I just finished playing hide and seek. The way he talks to Boss is so sweet !!,39
Oh and he's giving speeches about all the flowers in the forest. I find it adorable too,17
I- why,6

I agree :3,26

(Impossible),16
Thats why i desparately avoided any and all omori content google's stupid algorythm threw at me until i finished it,6
happened to me already😭,1
Maybe,63
imagine showing this to someone who never played omori and telling them that these are 3 different characters,53
Who didnt??,1
Be not afraid child, everything is going to be okay,188
,20
,11
be scared,10
You'll do the same. Trust me,1
Just... I don't recommend being in this subreddit until after you've played. There are a TON of spoilers here.,188
Oh you'll know and I'm not entirely sure that you'll be happy to know...,16
Why are you trying to spoil the game for yourself? Just play it. You shouldn't even be on this sub until you finish it, lmao.,11
It totally is! 😏,60
oh also, beware of >!late game !<,50
,2
,2
>!This is funny.!<,1
r/angryupvote,39
Why have you said this,26
>!I mean, I know another psychological horror game that has a fanbase that majes a lot of hanging jokes, and if the OP happened to also play that game then they would definitely see it that way, that's why I asked for a spoiler tag!<,5
>!You just spoiled the game for anyone who has already played Doki Doki Literature Club and seen the copious "leave her hanging" jokes they make in THAT fandom...!<,5
>!Spoiler tag this!<,-4
wholesome award is on purpose mwahaha ,1
He really is!!,1
not to mention the sheer amount of people making the same jokes like even if they don't look at the reactions OP's probably gonna notice the patterns and at that point its just putting 2 and 2 together,2
You guys suck at being subtle. These are the most unsubtle spoilers I have ever seen. Like holy shit. Even the OP got tipped off that bad shit is going to happen to people and stuff, and they haven't even played most of the game! . . 0/10 stealth would get caught 5 seconds into being a spy.,7
i know it's not gonna happen but that doesn't mean i can't be mad about it lol,2
oh cool! tell me when you get to a certain point that you'll know when you're at ,28
How about now? . . Did that happen?,3
Youll see, just enjoy the game,6

[deleted],30

[deleted],11
Yep,1
Yeah this post definitely makes me feel like something's terrible is gonna happen to Basil lol,22
ok so we just entered his house and something weird happened. not sure if that's what you mean though,14
uhhhh well I'm back at the beginning of the game and I don't know why ?? definitely as weird but I don't know if it was " that ",9
Based + kel pilled,3
AHHH YESSSSSS,14
Sweetheart exists, nothing spoiled. Nothing was further elaborated upon.,18
game ruined because sweetheart spoiler  ,10
Yes now the entire game for you is ruined.,5
Sweetheart doesn't add much if anything to the main plot and I only stated Sweethearts existence,3
(They failed),8
they would think "ohh so it's a game about blue people",1
**BE NOT AFRAID**,42
why would you spoiler the words "important plot point/twist". theres no reason to spoiler that,12
,14
&#x200B;. . ,8
Have you seen what happens in the game besides that? It turns into an entirely different game at one point,1
You know what I mean,-9
[removed],15

RemindME! 1 day "How’s mari doing",1
So how’s mari doing,1
ok why am I back at the beginning ? also I accidentally stabbed myself lol,17
you made it to the part I was referring to ,3
Did you save?. . Or did you finish the fist day?,2
*her theme starts playing*,3
[deleted],1
So now I know *not* to get attached. . Started playing yesterday so haha… yay,22
>!realistic something!<,8
I mean mentioning that there a plot twist is kinda a spoiler,8
I think knowing there’s going to be a plot twist kind of takes away from the gravity of it,2
[deleted],1
>!I don’t understand why people are downvoting you it’s a pretty obvious joke even if you don’t know the twist and people arent going to click on the spoiler tag if they haven’t beat the game!<,7
[deleted],10
I have. And now I have a lot of questions,15
I had a hunch since the beginning something was off with her since she wasnt part of the party that went to look for Basil. So I was mentally prepared when I learned lol,1
These are questions that would be better answered for yourself. The boy is missing, and you gotta go find him. Disregard whatever signals you’re getting here from people who are trying to throw thinly veiled spoilers at you, it would be best for you to draw your own conclusions and then come back for answers.,28
Casual sunday,4
DM me when you collect all the keys and reached a Yime Nikki styled area,-9
The fist day,1
Oh shoot srry,3
wait does basil get killed,9
>!biblically accurate!<,5
Not only that, but marking it as a spoiler is quite the plot twist,5
well yeah but... if there were no plot points or plot twists then... there would be nothing to USE spoilers on,2
>!yeah, the suicidal/mental health stuff is only partly taken seriously for the first part of the game, it's kind of a red herring. that character does talk about having depression beforehand, and tries to reach out to a friend for help, but it turns out later that it was actually caused by... meta bullshit. which is what DDLC is ACTUALLY about.!<,2
>!it's a pretty obvious double meaning!<,2
>!Still could be interpreted as a spoiler because of the comments on your comment mean something bad happens, causing people who haven't finished the game to read over your sentence again and get spoiled!<,1
Nice I guess (I don’t know how to react to someone who just found out someone’s dead),1
OMORI FANS TRY NOT TO SPOIL THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME CHALLENGE (IMPOSSIBLE),2
Sorry teacher,1
Really any answer is a spoiler but there are multiple endings. ,25
frick i meant that,1
[deleted],1
Wdym? The day of fisting is normal in omori,1
ffffuuuuu-,6
um... i wasn't really trying to recommend it to you.. . >!there's a LITTLE bit of buildup, like a scene or two where the character describes living with depression, and it's very in-character and realistic, and it's honestly kind of poignant, because it shows that people can be depressed even if they don't show it!... but then that all gets completely forgotten about while the game does its Freaky Glitchy Meta Bullshit and gradually goes off the rails.!<. . it's still a good story, and it's not a BAD portrayal of mental health, i think a lot of games could learn from it- but it's still not exactly a GREAT portrayal of mental health either. it's not the main focus of the story. the mental health discussion is *mainly* just there to >!foreshadow the Big Shocking Moment.!<,2

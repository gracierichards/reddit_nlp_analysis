kel: 🍞
but Kel is there so it's cannon
I want the kel shirt so badly but still Dk if I should get it or not
i got the kel shirt! honestly i’m very happy w the purchase, it’s bright and yellow and cute, right up my alley!
Same! And my friends call me identical to kel. I’m just worried that people are gonna call it girly because it says BFF and has hearts on it. I love it so much though
aw who cares about what they think, it’s such a nice shirt i say go for it!
Ya know what you’re right. If it will make me happy I should just do it. Thanks for the inspiration ^^
yay i'm so glad!!
Bro, you do what makes you happy! Screw what other people think! I'm sure it will look great on you.
kel would want you to have it lets be real and his opinion is the only one that matters
Wait they really have kel’s shirt for sale!?
Y E S
LINK IT PLEASE

i wish i had my own money because i so want that chibi kel shirt!!!!
Maybe someone will buy it for you for birthday or christmas :]
That'd be nice but it seems like Kel is the type to not be interested in anyone in his friend group
That's what it's like as the token bro of the group. Everyone around you hooks up, and you and your hidden feelings are left to rot as you continue to play the objective wingman and buddy.
KELBREY NATION RISE
Kel is here. This is canon
Kel also has the coconut
I like how kel's mouth is half of his face
kel is a skinwalker
Kel's face is amazing beyond description. If the game had some sort of ultimate emotion in it, *that* would be what it looked like.
I love how kel is just like “WELCOME TO THE CHANNEL! Today we are gonna throw a coconut at this random person!”
best post on this sub
idk I kinda like the one where Kel eats a glue stick

Wait seriously? I haven't even gone there,. . WHAT A COICIDENCE LMAO
I mean, every Kel meme IS cannon after all
But the sand is SUGAR, OF COURSE HE WANTED TO EAT IT, I WOULD.

Legends have sand addiction
Kel is that one friend that inadvertently saved the entire gang. . You will be missed Mari
Sand is yummy
Kel in orange oasis be like:
Legends have pet rocks
Kel is there, we know what that means lmao
Remember everyone, all Kel memes are canon!
Literally
Gods acknowledge the fact that they're unloved and wallow in their self hatred and guilt for an eternally long time, totally not speaking from experience here. . &#x200B;. . oh fuck wrontg sub
What's the right sub?
gods have flowers
No, no, he got a point.
Gods don't even make it into the meme because they're too busy taking good care of their garden
Memes aside. . Why'd you go so hard on that art Holy shit
Bruh I didn't even try that hard lol. . well okay I may have had to redo Kel several times cause the position was surprisingly hard

Remember all Kel memes are cannon you just made him eat sand
Where did you find the background?
KEL eats SAND!. . It didn't taste good.. . KEL became DISGUSTED.
I ate sand when I was little so i was legend?
legends DO eat sand you are right
Anything Kel does is Canon.
Hell yeah, be a legend everyone
Eat sand become legend... unless you're reading this then if you can read you'll probably get sick from it.
I wanna pick it off my toes and eat it!
Kel may not have bitches, BUT HE BALLIN
you know what they say, every kel meme is canon
Well I guess it’s sand time

Based kel
Why did I think of Wilbur Soot?
if you go to orange oasis…
Kel does eat sand
Kel is sad because he's gonna save everyone's ass by throwing snacks instead of basketball. . he doesn't have luxury of using skills, only whole pizzas and roasted chickens, sometimes jam (packet)
See, Hero is the healer but Kel is FASTER. So if I want to heal Aubrey before she can get turned into toast I have to patch her up before the boss moves and Hero is slower than a tortoise that’s just eaten your entire birthday cake. Solution? Kel throwing EVERYTHING you’ve got at his friends.
Nah hero has Fast Food which makes him heal before anyone else's turn. I just spam rebound with kel pretty effective
True, but fast food doesn’t heal multiple or heal up to full every time. Using Kel for his speed tends to be situational.
For that you can use Snack Time. I use it early, so if someone will be hurt, will be healed. I use Kel for healing only if things are going bad and if someone needs Juice.
I guess it's just the difference between using Ralsei and using actual food items.
Omori is the healer, Aubrey is emotional support/damage dealer, hero and kel are constantly attacking duh...
Haha flex austhestic chicken ball kel run n' gun go 9000 DMG brrr
Kel has so much stamina, I always use either his ricochet or annoying skill, it pairs so well with omori's mock!!
I use Kel so much for so many things wtf
So we're talking about how we use Kel in our playthroughs?  . . . Kel's the juice man, he brings the juice. I mostly throw juice at Omori since he expends so much juice, and the other two don't need to worry about it, or have so much of it to use with a moveset that combines both low cost and high cost abilities that they usually don't expend it as fast.. . If I'm not using Juice me/Rally, I'm using Kel for his followups (making Omori ecstatic/AOE followup with Hero), or Rebound (coupled with Aubrey's windup since it does less damage the  more enemies it has.)  . . . I almost never use items, but when I do, it's either everyone, or someone that could've spent their turn doing damage, as I don't mind wasting that turn if it means my party is going to be better healed/juiced for the next turn.
I went to orange oasis early and ended up getting over powered by fighting the enemies in the Dino Dig area, so the kids were all little murder machines with way too much Juice and Health, meaning I could go longer without restoring them. Kel was mostly used to make the whole party angry while Omori made the bosses sad, and then I would spam multi-hit attacks with Kel, Aubrey and Omori while Hero was the juice boi when necessary.
Poor Kel :(
Omg I'm dying inside!. . Poor Kel
I mostly use Kel as a single target damage dealer or an emergency healer. ehem ehem ecstatic + run n' gun ehem ehem
This is painfully funny, soz Kel
i dont know why people think Kel is useless in battle, like ????? damn, that follow-up with hero that hits all of the enemies is useful as hell when fighting more than one enemy, like in those fights with U.F.Os! hits all of them at once, kill them all and doesn't spend any juice? count me in! and with grinding as well! In my playthrough I barely used juice or snacks, just using a good strategy with Kel. Kel is definitely the most useful to me.
Kel is sad because 1.0 kel was trash
Hang in there kel!
Someone save the poor boy we know and love as Kel.
Kel for me was just to make Omori furious and throw snacks and juice at everyone.
For me, Kel’s the big damage dealer. He deals damage and he’s damn good at it. He’s also who I usually have use items because he’s faster than everyone else.
why couldnt it be omor? why kel??? kel did not deserve to have to fly in that way
I think sans is too laid back for kel. Kel and papyrus both have a lot of energy and enthusiasm. Hero and sans are both laid back.
well uhh...he did go through serious depression and verbally assault kel to the point of crying.....
first off he learned his lesson. second theres a differnce with how you loosely you treat your family compared to outsiders
It's sad that I can see this potentially happening and is just completely up to each individual headcanon since.  You know.  Open ended ending. . I still struggle to view how hero would react because he was the one closest to mari.. Aubrey may have had anger issues,  but her character arc and actions has me believe she'll be on the forgiving side. Emotionally troubled. But indubitably forgiving. Kel is Kel. He a bro.
Kel is just the sweetest thing ever♡
Yeah, but we all know Sweetheart is the sweetest character ever 🥰🙏 /j. . . . And Kel is just a thing (ALSO A JOKE, I LOVE YOU KEL)
Gotta swap out that Sayori dialogue for something more Kel
'basmketballe'
"cool! you wanna play basketball?"
Got ketchup mixed with lettuce cheese
Batman: "You're going to be my sidekick, Robin". . Kel: "But I wanna be **basketball man!**". . Batman: "No Kel, you can't be called basketball man. It doesn't really work with my whole dark knight thing". . Kel: "You can't tell basketball man what he can't be called!". . Batman: *\*sigh\**
KEL Passes the ball to BATMAN. BATMAN wasn't looking and gets bopped. taking 1 damge and becoming SAD!
BATMAN slaps KEL! KEL took 1 damage and became ANGRY!
What will KEL do? KEL attacks BATMAN! BATMAN takes 30 damage! KEL is victorious you gained 300 EXP! You got 80,000,000,000 CLAMS!
Kel got a new title: WANTED CRIMINAL!
Kel became toast! Actually, a corpse. Because he was shot two days later by some unrelated person.
Canon
Kel’s slowly building a cinematic universe of his own.
Kel and Batman crossover when?
You can already find the wildly famous Batman villain Kite Man in Pinwheel Forest!
katman
mugger is a meanie
Its canon
Tbh most other memes made in this format made less sense than this one. Granted, no Kel meme makes sense, but that’s just because all Kel memes are canon.
I love Kel so much
Only true chads already saw this in youtube
he isn't wrong
At least they can agree on something
This is canon now
i hold kel very gently
It’s canon, boys
I can't believe Kel met Batman.
wait no, this makes Kel and therefore OMORI canon in the DC universe go back before its too late
Omori strangles Superman using RED HANDS
this is where the mugger killed my parents Kel... . ay man you got any games on your batphone
You the YouTube man?
Kel is Robin but better.
So, is this canon now?

Kelsey?
Kel’s name is Kelsey
Source?
Early screenshots, and the fact that no one names their child just ‘kel’
kel :)
I'm pretty sure Kel is underage and Polly is an adult, so maybe not the best characters to ship?
Sorry I’m 12, what does “ship” mean in this context? (Not actually 12, Im almost 30 and apparently live under a rock)
Shipping is basically when someone takes two characters and goes "haha couple" even if they aren't actually a couple
Ahhhhhh lmaoo ok thank you
>not actually twelve, almost thirty and live under a rock. . No worries, i’m twenty and end up blindsided all the time.
I mean yea but when he's already old enough, sorry for sounding like im some weeb ass bnha shipper or smth. i just feel like they've got good chemistry.
I feel like if kel was older it would fit, but idk about in game like it is
i should've specified that i imagined them hitting it off post game when everyone's already adults, im sorry if anyone was offended that i suggested an underaged ship, im not a degenerate.
It’s good, you might wanna be careful about that sometimes, you could get very badly treated if you don’t specify that, so be careful for your own sake! Cause people can be rude.
i see more of a resemblance between polly and kel than kel and hero
Why is everyone commenting she looks like Kel????. . I see no similarity
But you don’t have to Kel is in the bottom left corner so that means it’s canon 😳
Kel is there so this is Canon now xD
ALL KEL MEMES ARE CANOJ
I SEE HIM IN THE CORNERW
Kel is in this meme so it's canon
no kel, sorry cant be canon 😔😔😔
Sorry pal but Kel is there...so this is canon now
I think kel would laugh
Lancer would get along with kel
Lowkey wanna see this ngl
Lancer: “So you’re telling me that if you can find out how to make a Dark World that lets all Darkners exist there without turning to stone, that you’d do it so that we could hang out?”. . Kel: “Yup!”. . Lancer: “Sweet!”. . Omori: “I’m pretty sure we could just use BL-“. . Queen: *puts a hand to Omori’s mouth*. . Queen: “Shush trauma boy you almost said spoilers.”
“Trauma boy” LMAO this is beautiful
I wanna make fanart of this now
I agree. Their personalities are so similar since they are both energetic and active. They also serve as their respective fandoms’ “meme” characters, so it’s wouldn’t be surprising if they would get along so well.
Haha but Kel is the one who hates pickles!
if you find the same kind of meme I can make one with Kel!
The Japanese fanart is a little bit... sussy...

Literally me but with the fanart on the right
Yeah I wish I could draw stuff of the quality the image on the left has.. . But I'm practicing, and learning.
Genuine question. Where did the whole "Kel likes burgers" meme come from? Is there something in the game that I missed, or is it just something made up by the fandom?
Borgir 🍔
Understandable, have a nice day.
comes from the #humphrey (omori memes) channel in omoricord, the original has sad sunny thinking of his friends in the dream world while kel is thinking about burgers with a remix of the song “murder on my mind” playing that instead says “burgers on my mind” and related stuff. burgers on my mind struck the collective hivemind of #humphrey users and became reposted several times daily, with many spoofs. meanwhile, the mods (or at least one, gilbert) hate it and there’s an automated system to increase or decrease slowmode that has the word “burger” as a trigger to increase it. most recently in yhe kel burgers timelinr, people spammed kel burgers in #humphrey yesterday to celebrate kels birthday. the slowmode got up to like 20 minutes last i checked lmao
damn i wrote a fuckin essay
true
Sorry but what do you mean with "true"?
yes
Understand have a nice day
Don't worry guys, the left fanart is just Sunny checking if Kel eats enough, everything is fine\~
borgir kel over dirty kel any-day fr

One on the left for sure 😤
Wish I could draw like the one on the left

how the heck did kel sort of float into the bomb and then got blown away
He just made a mistake when he played along. He can't be blown up
Kel‘s in it.   . It’s canon
gotta put kel in there to make sure it's canon
don't look at kel's shirt

Sorry Kel but I got you burger 🍔
No wonder Kel asks for her number
No wonder Kel gave her his adress
they look a little bit like kel for some reason idk if that’s just me
Is it bad that she looked like kel for a second.
I never knew kel looked so good in drag LMAO
Makel
It's weird to think Kim was getting a fucking basketball thrown at her face by Kel and her glasses didn't break.... . This makes me wonder just how little strength Kel was using to throw his ball,like everyone is super delicate and he doesn't want to hurt them.
kel has unfathomable strength and had to go easy on everyone so he didn't obliterate them. . proof: kel nuke in headspace
>!If Headspace is based off real life, then does that mean Sunny witnessed Kel nuke IRL?!<
You know, back in the day there was another town close to faraway town,but then the Kel incident happen and it disappeared for the map.. . It was the Kel nuke.
Kel as a healthy non-physically neglected athlete is the strongest fighter in faraway and is only holding himself back by using a ball.
Kel probably pulled an [omni man move]()
And also, that was 4 years ago. Kel is likely even stronger now.
Dear lord....
If he throws his ball downwards, the shockwave will be enough to send everyone flying towards Hocotate
For the record this has happened multiple times to me and my glasses werent even scratcheddjdjdje
nah kel throws it perfectly so that it hits it's target and then lands back to him
Kel is Steve Rogers of basketball
Kel really had to take that knife huh?
Really kel why take the knife? No wonder people hated him
I actually also forgot stabbing was bad after spending so much time in headspace and audibly gasped when that happened lmao . . Like i was so on autopilot "yeah sure, we solve problems by fighting" mode that it was a necessary push back to reality. I was low key really stunned like "wait. Did i really stab her? I didn't mean to-.. What? Oh no" . . Great timing in terms of game design lmao also appreciate kel stepping in immediately after
SAME LOL! The game design is so well done
I did the same exact thing I forgot I had the knife. I stabbed her and I felt horrible for it
This comment is one year old, damn.
Look I just finished the game don't judge me
Understandable, have a nice day
tbf I think the dialog says some crap like "uses brute force on kel" which could refer to anything not just the blatantly obviously spiked bat which could obviously one-tap any foe (also called "murder")
Yeah, given her heaviest hitting attack is a headbutt, the implication seems to be that she just kinda carries the bat around to look scary and doesn't use it on people. Further supported by her having the skill Home Run in the RW when she joins the party, which has the chance to just instantly defeat someone, so clearly the game recognizes that the bat will absolutely wreck someone.
Kel being a pinata
How is Kel needing bandages on his clothes?!
His clothes ripped, probably
If he brought pizza Kel would be invincible
kel is unstoppable 
"Kel I spent way too much money on these bandages please dodge attacks"
this is how you beat THE HOLLAGANS whitout PEPPER SPRAY, litterly use KEL ENCOURAGE and than just make KEL spam GAURD since they always taget KEL over SUNNY and than SUNNY slowly attaks while ocasionaly trowing a bandage at KEL
*”Just because you did something bad, doesn’t make you a bad person”*. . -Kel, 199X
Shitty AUing over and over, a bunch of overly angsty shit, the skeleton brothers fucking everyone including themselves, ect. However, most of this was during the first 2 years after it got popular, so most of bad shit has died down.
>Kel antagonized and attacked Aubrey at every point in the game. . Sorry, but that's just wrong.  . . . In the first encounter, Aubrey and Kim antagonized the boys first. Aubrey decided to verbally harass Sunny for sitting at home for 4 years and then decided to assault both Sunny and Kel while Kim pushed Basil a few times.  . . . In the second encounter, everyone was equally in the wrong. Sunny barged in before the sermon ended, Kel tried to get the album back instead of pulling Sunny back outside or stopping him from entering and waiting for the sermon to end, and Aubrey started arguing with Kel to the point where it got physical. No one was in the right.  . . . In the third encounter, Kel only wanted to help Basil. Imagine finding your old friend crying for help while a bunch of delinquents that you've already previously fought are surrounding him. Plus, he barely attacks her unless you use the pepper spray. And while Aubrey doesn't attack Sunny and Kel in the fight, she doesn't stop the hooligans from doing so.  . . . You could've at least tried to bring up the exact points where bad things happened purely because of Kel's actions instead of generalizing all of his actions and demonizing him for no reason.  . If you really want to show what Kel did wrong, you can bring up the lake cutscene where Kel sent Sunny to save Basil from drowning and forgot that he's afraid of swimming.
I agree, though I wanna add some things:. . >!After the first encounter, Kel took away Sunny's knife, due to how dangerous it is as weapon, showing us that Kel is someone who doesn't want to hurt others unless he needs to. Pragmatically, it was a bad decision, since it was the only thing saving them from Aubrey, but from a moral standpoint, it shows a lot of care for others that the Kel back then might not have shown.!<. . >!I feel like Aubrey did most of the wrong stuff in the church, while Sunny did step into the church before the sermon ends and where Aubrey would be more likely to talk with them, the church isn't going to save her from real life consequences like theft and she should have admitted here her wrongdoings, especially when in Christianity, stealing is a sin. Kel could get some flak for his tactless approach with Aubrey while talking but the fact that he even tried to talk with her and even showed compassion and understanding shows that he trusts her enough to hold a conversation with her. Aubrey while being disturbed during a sermon shows no real understanding of her friends pain or what she has been doing; Hurting them. While both parties made mistakes, Aubrey made much more IMO. !<. . >!The delinquents also didn't tried to prove that they weren't hurting Basil by wanting him gone from the hangout spot and didn't really understood why Kel wants them to stop bulling Basil, which shows that they didn't care for him and that they don't respect him. Aubrey then attacks them with a group of 6(technically 5, since Charlene isn't attacking them). Even if Aubrey wins against Kel, she still hasn't enough of them after he pointed out how hypocritical she us being.!<. . >!Aubrey could have needed softer criticism, but she didn't made it easy for others and only then admitted what she did was wrong, when she nearly ended Basil. Also didn't Kel forgot that Sunny nearly drowned? I think it's hard to blame him for forgetting this, since it was 4 years ago. Kel's biggest mistake was  trying to reach just to Hero after the incident and not the others.!<
I don’t think that he didn’t seem to care as much, I just think he did a better job than anyone else of dealing with his trauma. I feel like by the time we see Kel in the real world he’s learned to accept what happened.
Ik that's what I mean, it seems like he doesn't care, but it's just that he's not showing how it did . . I was upset at first but ik people just process trauma different
nah i hate kel
Canon even without kel
"Please fix my aspect ratio, for crying out loud Kel, put me back into 4:3!"
oh well unfrotueanly i dont even have an xbox so uhhh oof. . also miraculously i have been successfully not spoiled yet to omori so if i ever do get to play it, which is very unlikely, i will sure never forget it! Such an interesting game judging from what little gameplay i have seen.
Wait? **KEL IS IN IT?**. . **THE WHOLE GAME WAS JUST A FUCKING ACT?! ;-;**
omg i really want kel's shirt rn
I don't think it's a big leap in logic at the very least. Sunny may have been a shut-in, but his mom clearly cared, so while she didn't know how to help his greater issues, she likely tried to keep him at least somewhat taken care of. Establishing a basic routine of hygiene and eating would make sense in that regard, and Sunny following it to keep his mom appeased and thus giving him more time to spend dreaming in the long run would make sense.  . . As far as his physique goes, malnourishment absolutely is part of it (and I'll note that his in-game stats do reflect this. In a fight without a knife, his punches do a quarter of Kels damage, and Kels just casually throwing a basketball at people), but I imagine what muscle he had probably also atrophied in the years in the house. He probably wasn't an athlete even as a kid, but he was active and played outside with his friends plenty, so it stands to reason he'd have some physique to lose.
I just assumed he had a habit/coped by very metaciously groomimg himself etc. . He has plenty of time and still does some stuff at home. . So over time he likely developed a habit of properly dressing and grooming his hair etc
to be fair, along with that, realistically in the fights, unless kel is inhuman at making his ball bounce back to him, he would be constantly going off to pick up his basketball so he can throw it again.
More like he would look like  a skeleton
>!the issue is finding someone else to take care of her, if nobody steps up then since Aubrey is 16 she'd most likely fall under care of the state. Hopefully she'd be adopted by Kim or even Kel's family!<
Kel: "Wow! Look at all of these! So perfect for hugging!". . Basil: "Uh, yeah... but maybe don't-". . Kel: \*giving life-sized Sunny pillow a bear hug\* "Wow it's so cuddly! Could probably use a wash tho". . Basil: \*sweating profusely\* "Hehe yeah...". . Kel: \*frowning\* "He uh, doesn't want to let go... what the hell??". . Basil looks on in abject terror as the pillow sticks to Kel
I think they said something about Kel's face and his position, or ketamine.
Sounds likely.
they said something along the lines of “why does he look like that lol”, i said ketamine

Kel kinda sus
Kel being kel
Kel is that you
Omori's just eating salted rice and seaweed; and Kel's probably awake 24/7 if he drinks that on a daily basis.
The flavour text on kel's orange joe is perfection
Nah, kel is just based
Leave me and my proof for autistic Kel be lol
All autistic people are based that is just fact
Exactly
As someone who knows many autistic people, I can confirm they’re all awesome
Honestly, my best friend is autistic and I would trust them with my life. They are amazing.
Hello i can vouch for this as an autistic person i am awesome
I’ll drink Kel’s orange joe
I feel like Kels OJ would actually be ok if the coffee was replaced with like Red Bull or something
Kel: holding orange Joe*. Hey you guys want some orange jo-.*sees what happened*. I will take that as a no
every kel meme is canon
That's true
This gives me the will to live
Kel is in speedy mcqeer
kel would 100% be the best wingman ever
Remember: all Kel memes are canon; he wouldn't, he IS
oh yeah right
Does this mean Kel is both trans and not trans at the same time?
If they were in memes, **yes**
He is a walking paradox I love him
Reverse flash if he was a good guy and didn't have powers 🗣️🗣️🗣️
Kel has powers in some memes. He has powers.
It’s called genderfluid
oh sup dude
Hey
Nah, Kel’s just that tall

seems like i see the two kids kissing each other, while kel is just..Peace out.
Yes, this image brings me great joy.. . >! Now we gotta have the Cactiflower side plot. It’ll be so peak, trust🙏!<
Yessssss Cactiflower forever
Why can you see the emoji while the spoiler is there?
Idk, doesn’t show up like that for me
I just see the White bar and the praying emoji inside of it, it is really weird
COOKED WHAT. . 
this was one of top 3 posts of 2024.. . 
This pic gives me midwest emo vibes
aww this is why i like these 3! 
kel is the friend we all wish for
Still has me wondering, just how much of those old art pieces as such from the early days of the Omori fandom do we keep missing?
Bro this art is so good!
drools THIS ART IS SAUR GOOD
Kel is a good wingman as he are
Juggling rats 🤹🏻‍♂️🐀
Best bro ever♡
Did you just draw this or is there like an original picture with real people and you just turned it into Omori characters
[original]()
oh nice thanks
Kel so swag like that.
Kanon
hell, yeah
I mean, it's not like Kel's getting NOTHING out of it...
Wdym by that? 🤨
You should probably ask your parents.
 Kel must be having the time of his life in that position 😂😂
Bro was feeling those cheeks💀
GYA-
Wtf
Average sanity of Omori fans being put on display
Lmao, I don't even know why I got them negative upvotes.
okay bro what.... that was such an unneeded comment😭
wait what did bro say
He said something about kel liking Aubrey’s thighs around his neck so ew
what the hell. 
These are teenagers.
And so am I. I'm not some guy in his 20s or 30s who just sits around all day using the internet.
Not really, I only use reddit for fun because I actually have a life.
That's still a gross comment to make about teenagers?? You could be of any age, but it's still just kind of a weird take.
nahh whatt 😭😭
kel in the meme, certified
Thank you based Kel

As long Kel is there
I would have thought Kel would fight over the last bottle of Orange Joe or some scenario along those lines...maybe I'm just conflict keen.
Dream Kel likes milk, so that wouldn't happen
Kel would definitely do finger guns with his dream self
OCTOPUS hits KEL!. IT HIT RIGHT IN THE HEART!. KEL takes 69420 damage!
Kel is ready to nuke the shit out of that octopus- oh wait this is the real Kel.... . . Does it still count ?
when no run and gun
just use an actual gun
Still significantly worse
but better
That Octopus is more powerful than Life Jam guy, the most powerful being in Headspace!
Nice
kel was never heard of again
kel is goin to die bro XD
Every kel meme is canon
Oh god Kel XD
i hate this side of kel, if he wasnt like that, then i would like it more
Hey Kel drink this coffee for me
The Kel Nuke? What's that? Can you give me a link to that strategy?
you make kel happy or ecstatic, give him coffee, use a ball that ups his speed, and use run-n-gun (use flex for even more damage)  . see [this]() for more info  . it can deal 8000+ damage on late game bosses
the rationale is that run-n-gun is dependent on Kel's speed, which can be further boosted by coffee, the happy emotion, and flex.
The Chicken Ball is the key to this strategy with its 200 speed addition.
Kel feels his best, but he hasn't flexed.
When he flexes it’ll become number 1
all hail the power of kel
Kel pulled a Kel Nuke on Sans (geeeeeet dunked on!).  . Basil used weed killer on Flowey.  . Aubrey bashed Mettaton to pieces.  . Hero made Undyne into sushi.  . Omori did not succumb to Chara and won.  . Sunny beat Frisk after an intense knife fight.  . Sweetheart beat Asgore with her mace.  . Papyrus was accidentally rammed by Pluto, who happened to pass by.  . The rest of the underground was cleaned up by Captain Spaceboy, his space pirates, and the Hooligans.. . And thus Undertale was surpassed by OMORI.. . EDIT: It was DETERMINATION that prevented OMORI from succumbing in his battles.
KEL passes to OMORI. . OMORI feels HAPPY!
You're Awesome!
Seeing Kel being so fricking tall in Headspace throws me off-
I agree with Kel, he is adjusting great
>!“I then had to use Kel’s pepper spray on her because she was bullying someone. ~~Still bumbed I couldn’t stab her again tbh~~!<
Yes, but when you make fun of them, they feel offended. The reason why I'm bringing this up is because viewpoints aren't set in stone, people's views can and will change over time. Insulting them will only offend them and make them less likely to change their views.
Huh, good point. . 
I agree smol hongler
Real talk, if they were to make an OMORI movie with the grown-up party members 20 years later, Jack Black wouldn’t make a bad Kel
There are two towns named faraway right next to eachother and the exact same things happen. . Kel is just fast enough to be in both at once
You can pick it up >!from Kel's mother's handbag on the second day. It does 500 damage.!<
Parry this you filthy casual
kel was included in the meme that brought this about its canon
Kel is in the meme, so of course it is!
This… this doesn’t count as a Kel meme, does it?
E V E R Y  K E L  M E M E  I S  C A N O N
so Aubs just had to accept her inner Kel?
Aubes must.
Idk I've never played omori
All Kel memes are canon.
And then she turned herself into a kel, the funniest shit I’ve ever seen
Kelbry
Aubrey: "i hate kel!" *Turns into kel*
the chances were extremely likely that a brick would somehow end up hitting *ME* in the head if I stayed much longer after that…
she works as minecraft skeleton


🗿
r/angryupvote

damn
Zamn 


Cool, I like your headcanon as well! we both agree with Kel and Hero on some extend hah! Sunny would be interesting to go out of his way traveling around. Basil, obv flower boi. Damn Aubrey would be one scary social worker  . . Poor Kel lmao!!

No matter the age, Kel is always ballin'
Kel looks like he fights bears for fun
And wins
Then befriends the bear
then rides it into a chuck-e cheese
ok i’m aroace but kel is kinda hot 😳
Kel's face is similar to Tarzan. I love it
Grown-up Kel is uh. . He's very uh. . How to put this. . I want him to accidentally knock me over on the sidewalk then help me up while the sun hits his grin just right and the wind tosses his hair.. . Does that make sense?
Kel would be the best P.E teacher in the world.
Kel gives me major Theo vibes from Celeste. Idk he just does. This art is fucking awesome btw
Kel got a massive glow up. Can we make this canon?
Phys ed teacher kel is brilliant I love that
Kel looks like Gordon Freeman help

Skinwalker Kel
Kel took the art of war a bit too literally here.
oh i was wondering where kel went lol
well, there’s Kel, sooo..
ah yes, the building blocks of the universe.. . kel
Wait, Kel is male?
Yes
Still can't belive they whitewashed kel, smh.
does this mean kel makes transphobic tweets




Genuine question, I keep seeing people do this, but all I see is numbers? What am I missing?
Oh it's custom emojis you can't see them load if whatever you're using hasnt updated
Ah, I see, thank you very much.
great now it's canon
We had too much power, we should have known that power corrupts…
and antisemitic. . wtf Kel!
Kel is a good guy just don’t ask him about Israel

lets call that "a little trolling"
Kel was never the same after the rain incident with Aubrey 😔



kel getting trapped/stuck in or on things is probably a semi daily occurrence.
Considering the crazier stuff he does (remember, EVERY KEL MEME IS CANON), he probably thinks this is low on the craziness that Kel takes part in.
yes
kel
kel
Kel
kel
Typical Kel
it's not even weird that he tried sticking his finger in the wall in the first place
It's a miracle that natural selection didn't get Kel long ago
Why would natural selection weed out something as precious as Kel?
Because Kel is the ultimate life form
he’s a gift from above
this is definitely something kel would do
A good day to remember that all Kel memes are canon
Just Kel being Kel
all kel memes are canon right?
I’ve got my sprite cranberry, Kel, can we go?
Thereisaskeletoninyourcloset.
Wait it even detects the c word in other words?
That's 2 hours ago, should be fixed now. 
Oh ok 
Papyrus is in your сloset.
WOWIE!
i like to believe that mikhael would eventually start to chill with his chuuni shit after spending enough time with kel. . and then years later kel holds it over his head to embarrass him
YES!! 
no one kel 

Is it just me, or does Kel look like the fnf girl?

>!and Kel is Kel.!<. . >!Kel is eternal.!<
Man I'm a girl but now I wanna cosplay as kel because we have the same hair
You should so do it!! There’s not enough cosplays from Omori out there! 😄
that’s cool！ looking forward to your kel’cos.
You know, at one point there was to be a female Kel. Looked just like regular Kel but with slightly longer hair
KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL KEL
He would do this, especially after those posts about him drinking paint
every Kel meme is canon
Kel: "Damn, these gushers are on point!". . Hero: "KEL WTF!? I think you know those are tide pods!". . Aubrey: "Oooh, when Kel dies I want his shoes". . Sunny: "Dibs on his Xbox". . Basil: "Stop it guys! We need to get Kel to a hospital!". . Sunny: "Awww, do we have to?". . Aubrey: "Yeah, shut up Basil. I need new shoes!"
I can't read any of this with a straight face.
Kel was never the same after discovering Orange Joe was discontinued.
Cute art style!
thank you!! :DD <33
i don't think you understand. . your art style is *REALLY CUTE*. . i cannot stress this enough you must keep drawing things  .  >!specifically kel!<

Wait this twitter thing is kinda co-. . KEL NO
: Yes Kel. Join the Dark Side!. . : Kel! Stay strong!. . : M-must...resist.... . : (Is about to throw a piano at Basil)
Join the Dark Side Kel. . Screw it im getting tw- (gets knocked out by Aubrey). . ... Why did you d- (Gets piano thrown at him)
: Sunny! Guys! We need to undo the brainwashing on him and Kel!. . : Isn't that called Deprogramming?. . : But how do we undo Twitter brainwashing?!. . : There is a way... but it's dangerous
Im willing to do anything to undo the brainwashing! Just please show us the way!. . Yeah please!
: We must defeat Elon Musk in combat!
(And so they went forth and confronted elon musk)
(Elon Musk turns his spinny chair while petting a cat). . Elon: Well well. A please to meet you Mister Bo- wait you aren't James Bond. . : No! We are not James Bond, wait why did you think we were?. . : What are you doing that has the attention of an international spy?!
 the same stuff we have been doing! Committing multiple war crimes in the span of 2 hours.
Sorry, Swethort, Kel ate it all
They are likely catching a dunsparce just to see that he is garbage lmao
Just kel being kel
Kel would not let a moment like this just go by... he took Basil's camera and took a quick photo. Since Kel was present, this is automatically canon.
Ah yes. . The power of Kale
You're right! I think I can see Kel in the backgroud!
He's the same color, it's just a little hard because of that.
Suffer hearing damage most likely
Little did I ever expect to see a Byzantine flag in this place.
Never change, Kel.. lol. This is brilliant!
KEL is such a silly bean
Yeah what a goof ball
Ofcourse it's canon, Kel is in it!
If there's Kel. It's canon
Kel being Kel
Add Kell to make it canon please I swear to God
(he hid your ip from kel)
 <--- (this is kel)
(oh no)
(he drank coffee)
(kel gave him coffee)
He singlehandedly brought the friend group back together. Kel is the SHIT
He's very good, but don't sleep on my boy Hero. He  believed in Aubrey after Kel gave up on her, and helped them make up. It's safe to say both bros are cool !
Why not both?. . Both are good
DVHSOFHDDJ ION KNOW IF THIS IS A KEL SLANDER BUT BOI IT'S FUNNY😭✋
I just like sunny cuz he reminds me of me. . I like Kel because . 1. He is Kel. 2. He is the best. 3. He almost singlehandedly brought back the friend group. 4. He's a true bro. 5. All Kel memes are canon. 6. He is Kel . 8. Kel is related to Hero
kel isn't in any "good, neutral, evil" alignment. he is simply Chaotic.
So, neutral?
every kel meme is canon
The Cult of Kelsey has spoken.
Kel is a great friend, a good person and also deeply fucked up inside, jesus christ these kids need help
Kel is deeply fucked up? Wdym?
Replace kel with Aubrey and that's the reason I like both of them... . . . . Kel is second best boi. . . Basil is 3rd.... . . Hero is 4th..
kel my beloved
I think its the same in the both characters, there's so many reasons to love Kel.
For real. He's my favorite character for a lot of.deeper reasons than he's just funny comic relief man.
Yeah, characters like Kel. Rarely get fleshed out. Its nice to see him realistically deall with the situation.
Yess, Kel is my best boi. I feel like his character gets overlooked the most and it saddens me cause there's more to him than a lot of people give credit for. He is adorable and does the funny tho which is always a plus.
I love Kel because he really just reminds me of my little brother haha.
Kel is a BRO, mvp of the real world
Kel supremacy
Get a kel in that image and make it canon
. . kel added
Yes
And, by some miracle (most likely plot armor), he never as much as scratched the car.
This is canon. . There's Kel so I can happily say that this is canon
500 were spent sobbing about Kel
ah ~~bollocks~~ f>!kel!<k, i spelt colonise with the s
Kel be like: 
She probably didn't mean that. She was probably only talking back to Kel, remember she was only 12 at that point, if not younger. Or probably, her parents are racist and therefore she unconciously took after them and was still too young to realize what she was thinking was wrong 🤔
I think you're looking too deeply into it, she responded like that when Kel said pink was a gross color lmao
No it's not Kel! You're the wrong color! 
Kel is cool no matter what
Kel approves this comment
 \[Kel Disapproves that Message\]
"Toriel being homophobic". Everyone: I pretend I did not see. "Aubrey saying that Kel was a weird color when she was only 12, lived in the 1990s and probably was only offended at that moment and always argues with Kel." Everyone: R A C I S T !!!!111!1
You're a gross color, kel
Are Latinos brown? If so, then what are Hindus and Arabs? . . Never mind, I forgot that some theorize that Kel might be Philippino.
He has an ofrenda in his house, he's most likely Mexican
You mean here? . . 
Yeah
I am mixed race black/white but was marked Latino in school sometimes back when mixed race was not an option and therefore you was forced to choose.
So…you chose Carmel?
I always refused or just "incorrectly" marked two.
Good idea.
Same
There is kel in this review os its cannon
kel cringing
Kel refuses to even look at you.
He is cringing too hard, it physically hurts him.
i find the idea of dead-inside kel having that face so fucking funny
kel: "what a terrible day to have eyes"
joke was so bad his eyeballs fell back into his head 😔😔😔
Kel: "Not Funny. Didn't. Laugh!"
Kel is trying to process what the fuck you just said.
And then they all die to a fucking green skeleton
If I had a nickel for every time I saw Earthbound called an indie game, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice.
You'd still only have one, look at the chalk board- it says they're honored guests.
Where uboa my man, WHITE FACE MY DUDE GASTER, SOMETHING, SKELETRON, SANS AND PAPYRUS!!!!!H O L L O W K N I G H T!!!! WHERE ARE THE SKRUNKLYS. . But this is still beautiful art tho and there are still plenty of skrunks
No skrunklies, only YIIK
This is main characters only. Also Hollow Knight isn't an RPG.
Oh yeaha
How to be in love with all of your friends simultaneously 101
This has been a wonderful cinematographic experience
Bye bye, Kel, I'll miss you.
He flew too close to the Sun(ny)
this is incredible
Then Kel suddenly wakes up, with every single fiber of his being telling him *not to leave the fucking house if he values his eyes ~~and manhood.~~*. . Meanwhile, Aubrey suddenly has an uncontrollable urge to march towards someone menacingly while [Cyberwildlife Park]() plays in the background.
Mom everyone started kissing. Please pick me up.... I'm scared
Rip Kel 2021.
POV: Malewives getting kisses, a sudden war and a blushing cat
This is Canon
it isnt a meme, but it does have kel in it...
Kel alone gives it the canon approval, doesn't matter
We turn it into a meme and it will be.
RIP Kel. . 2014-2021
Kel is fucken *DEAD*
Omori plays all sides so he can come out on top
Beautiful.
Cant believe Kel is dead. . I love this omg so cute,,
"Hard to believe ~~he's~~ Kel's dead."   . . . "Were it so easy."
Here's the actual twitter post 
Can't really control if someone decides to delete their twitter account a year later unfortunately

Kel with da glocko what will he do?
It is? I only thought of it as a Kel Moment.
...yes? It's a really common trope of a romantic plot. I've only seen it once where it wasn't, and that was where it was showing creepy people
Oh. I didn’t know that.. . Damn it Kel XD
Wait what about hector x kel 
Leave the dog alone
No no, Hector the rock x Kel. I mean Kel was distraught when he and Hector were separated, and - what's that phrase shippers use whenever anyone shows any emotion whatsoever - "there's no platonic explanation for this".
  I can fuck the dog if I want
 Kel no, Shane Dawson lied to you.
: There’s a difference between being a furry and a zoophile, Kel.

lmao you are very wrong by thinking that people wouldnt try to funk a skeleton
Sans moment
“83% of gamblers quit before they make it big, Omori!”. . -Kel, in denial, upon his 20th consecutive loss.
I think Kel only won me like 200 clams once and lost every single one after that lol
KEL NO!
: Damn… Hero’s gonna kill me. . : Oh, what’s the problem, Kel?. . : Lost like, a shit ton of money gambling cause I thought I’d get a profit, bummer.. . : Oh silly Kel, black market organ selling is way more profitable than that, you should try it!. . : I… I don’t feel comfortable talking about this anymore, Mari, where’s Sunny?. . : 🔪 Don’t worry, the two of you'll see each other very soon...
No fucking way it's Kel

Understandable, have a great day
He looks like he just found out that kel drank the entire ornage joe supply and didn’t leave any for him
: What a coincidence, I like Kel. I guess you don't mind me being with him then.
: Good thing I always carry a knife \*stabby stab-stab in the stomach\*  . : That was a weird-ass dream. I should probably visit Kel.
That dream was so tarumatic and wierd..... . Maybe i should stop eating spoiled steak before sleaping
What have I just witnessed...

Oh wait, we talking about Kel? Guess this is canon now
Based Kel
I like how Kel has burgers on his mind lol.
he always does!  LMAOO
kel brane ful of **🅱️urg**
Of course Kel has burgers on his mind-
Kel’s got burgas on his mind
I'm with you Kel: Burg....
Kel be like: BORGAR
Same Kel same
Kel is god, he is above sparing his thoughts on such trivial interests
KEL GOT BURGERS ON HIS MIND
omg chibi kel is too cute
The expression of Birdget has big Kel energy.

Actually it's Bridget but this person above (or was it below) me calls her Brisket because it's mixed with Bridget And Kel.
no it's because of a meme of someone making an edit of bridget smiling with pink "Brisket <3" text and it basically became how we call her now lol
sorry for being the "akshually 🤓" gal
Oh, my mistake :P. I thought its mixed with those names lol my bad.
Brisket <3
from where?
Considering the visuals and topics that the game touches on, Omori would more likely be traumatizing to kids under 16/18.
But why? I've watched a thousand movies worse than Omori and I've come out the other end relatively untraumatized. There's really nothing that bad about Omori's storyline.
Everyone has different tolerances, your circumstances and ability to digest these things are not similar to the mass majority population of that age group if you're 14. . . Omori's topics are dark in the sense of mental health awareness and having crippling feelings of self deprecation, unhealthy addiction for nostalgia, and death.
I'd argue otherwise. I've asked (and honestly just already know) that 0 of my friends have experienced any sort of "trauma" from playing Omori, or any similar game for that matter. Obviously my friend group and I do not represent the entire population, but I'd say we're pretty darn close.. . Hot take time if you'll bear with me for a minute. A lot of people nowadays like to claim trauma from a lot of things. Sometimes they do it for a joke, sometimes (a lot of times) they do it for attention, etc... Point is that if a game like Omori really traumatized that many people, the world would have bigger issues than the age rating of a game. Also, Reddit is not a great place to judge such things as mental health etc.
Kel face it's canon now
FOR GODS SAKE KEL. . THERES NO TREAT 
what's that on your shoulder then. . *points to the piece of candy on their shoulder*. . treat.
It's part of my shirt, Kel.. . THAT'S NO TREAT JESUS CHRIST
*eats the candy on your shirt*
OMG.......... In life. I'm The Kel!!!! To Almost a scary point.
do you know the orangne joe recipe
Not yet. I've only just got into this game through my friends showing me. And then I saw this Reddit page and joined.
Should you give me the recipe or will that spoil the game
Every Kel meme is canon
Welp, guess kel failed ebglish in canon then, oh well
the first time i saw this meme format, i thought of kel 
Kel da treat. .

Awww don’t be bad to him guys, give Kel a treat! 
Kel is da man
HELP this is so kel
KEL ACE DEFECTIVE
Kel's version of the "Swiper no Swiping" thing.
kel is gone, the gang isnt the same
WITHOUT YOOOU
Now Kel can finally be ballin while drippin
If it has Kel on it then it’s canon
**YES IN KEL VOICE**
Make a Kel meme for the last panel. We all know that makes it canon
on it.. . edit: [it is finished.]()
PERFECT.
Kel starts out not knowing what polyamory is
"'Polly amory'? I mean, she's a wonderful lady, but we're kind of young for her, don't you think?"
Amory… like… OMORI????? HOLY FUCKING SHIT
Polly x Omori
Seems about right.
looking at this image made me want to start a fire for Kel to save me
So Kel indeed is the Sans of this fandom, huh?
There are comparisons to be made. . Kel is a wacky and humorous individual, like the funny bone man. I don’t think kel is as serious as sans typically though because as jokey as sans is, he isnt fucking around either
Since we do have a canon clone of him, sorta???
I played OMORI during the worst time of my life, when I was suicidal too. I only ever took away a message of hope from the game, and it helped me take the first steps to try and recover from my issues with maladaptive daydreaming. . . It's probably less so that OMORI encouraged anything, and more likely that they were suffering with issues already. A lot of dark media can be surprisingly comforting to people who are suffering with intense issues and make them feel less alone. I do agree though that OMORI's M rating is something that shouldn't be overlooked though.
I think the discussion surrounding the portrayal of suicide in Omori is thought-provoking. He liked the game but also hated it for being dark. The game has content that could trigger a suicidal person but there is also focus on those around the sufferer like Kel. Who helps the person helping others? It's important to not forget about the Kels out there, instead of just focusing on the Basils and the Sunnys.
He’s not really at a turning point at the start of the game. He only started getting better after opening the door for kel. And if he could speak to order pizza then he would have spoken to his friends when he left the house. The only time we see him speak is at the end of the game
Especially if you hear kel’s story about how they handled it(forgot how to use spoilers so can’t specify)
And more than likely dead.
So I never actually went into Kel's house at all in my first run and my second run was a max achievements Omori route, what's wrong with Kel's parents?
Honestly? My issue with Kel and Hero's parents is probably too biased to be a fair judgment simply because my own childhood and current-adulthood is...rife with a certain type of parent. And Kel and Hero's Mom reminds me too much of my own. Not even in the Favoritism sense, but in a different scene. So! I don't argue with people on it because I could just be coloring the text with my own lenses, you know? Better be safe than sorry on things I don't have concrete evidence for, like tone and body language.
Favoritism. They treat Hero much better and ignore Kel.
How is Kel not winning awards his parents' fault?
The post text
Yes, he definitely was, but they should definitely recognise KEL as the chad he is
Its not just that incident, its from other stuff too. >!The house is full of awards, none of which are kels (not counting participation as an award). Kel tries to avoid his parents like 3 times iirc. Kels mom yells at him but thanks hero.!< Not to mention [this]()
I mean... He didn't win awards, that's not his parents fault.
I mean they put em on the fireplace and stuff too which just rubs it in lol
i vividly remember seeing 198X on kels wall and the last resort painting or i’m going insane, i’m gonna load up my game and check. . edit: dude what the fuck i just checked and it said 199X i swear it was 198X i’m losing my mind
kel and Hero’s parents are pretty good unless there’s some sketchy shit from a route I didn’t do where they beat kel or smth
Kels dad is pretty good
Sunny: Dad isn't bad, he was just pressured into the ground. Mom is trying her best.. Kel: parents r good. Aubrey: Mom left. I don't really know about her dad. Hero: brother of kel
Kel's parents are good, they are flawed but still good parents.a
I relate to Kel. . 
We're just silly goofy  def not hiding any of our feelings 
haha we're defo just borgar 
Its not exactly the same but omori has inspired me. Well like. Kel has inspired me. He’s a hard head at times but Kels coping mechanisms, constant optimism, and fitness has inspired me to get out more, and more importantly gain weight and muscle.
I relate to both Kel and Sunny at the same time. But mostly Kel.. . Sometimes I feel reclusive, but other times I feel like I can run all over the place saying whatever and slightly annoy my irl friends while doing it. 
I relate to kel 
Nothing compared to Kels basketball!
Nothing compared to a single tiny can of pepper spray.
Nothing compared to Hector.
Kinda coincidental that kel means bald in turkish
LOL
: (whispers to Kel) Why is everyone looking at me like this?. . : DUDE, YOU GOT A FUCKING KNIFE!. . : But she has a nail bat.. . : It's just for intimidation, I swear!. . : It worked. I thought you were going to smash my skull
That made me chuckle
: …..shit, not again. Why can’t I heal him?. . : don’t worry, I used my ***\[BY YOUR SIDE\]*** on Kel, he’s perfectly fine now. . : oh hey cool I’m a ghost too. Am I my own STAND?. . : I think you’re just dead, Kel.. . : so… no one will comment about me… just coming back from the dead?. . : naaaah, i see bizarre shit like this on a daily basis. . (BIZARRE INDEED)
: i do not know, kel..
: w-what happened to you, kel??
 (Kel is unresponsive.). . : Oh, right, you're unconscious.... . (What will Hero do now?)
: Hey, Kel! Are you feeling better now?
Love that shot of Kel
: \*foaming at the mouth while holding a knife\*. . : KEL CALL ANIMAL CONTROLL!!!!. . : he's gone rabid
I don't think Kel can take another loss lol
then what explains that black space room where a man (likely Sunny's dad) was like ''Stay away.. You are not my son"? He had no reason for saying that besides the truth.. . Also Kel is hinted at repressing his emotions at the graveyard scene where he is smiling while describing his parents neglect.. pretty bad takes ngl
I feel like this fandom generally just misinterpreted the the overall message and how the game is . . People seem to only latch on to the headspace characterisations of the characters . . As the headspace counterparts are meant to be simple but then they add it to the rw cast and it doesn’t make sense plus with added headcannons and putting all sorts of random pro nouns and hobbies and lgbtq sexuality stuff (which they don’t have and we aren’t shown to have). There’s nothing wrong with lgbtq characters in games it’s just the game doesn’t even show them to be like that. . Like if omocat wanted them to be apart of it, wouldn’t the game show us and even heavily imply it?. . But no instead we get people misunderstanding characters . . I think another character that’s mid understanded is MARI. She is either shown to be an egotist or such a wholesome person who is perfect in every way. But we are never shown that she is . Sure she is a kind person but she is by no definition perfect, from the photo album we can see that she is insecure about making mistakes and that she doesn’t think anything she does that really good is not worthy (reference being the flower crown rw description or the photo of her getting camera shy). . While MARI is a “mother figure” in the group she is also a massive troll however people only associate this with HERO and completely forget the photo where MARI stole BASILs camera to take a picture of SUNNY and BASIL reading . Although this is more understandable . Then people viewing her a narcissist . . And I feel like people misrepresent HERO. Although it’s less bad but still weird . Like people think HERO would kill SUNNY after the truth I get it’s a meme but there are fics out there that are like that and that’s not like him at all the only time he lashed out was at KEL but that’s when he was at his worst but after his rant he realised that he unintentionally hurt KEL he stopped. People also think KELs and HEROs parents abusive to KEL when while they have their favourite they are never shown to even abuse KEL if anything KELs mum is strict with KEL because how much she worries
If you just want to obliterate, give Kel the Beach Ball Weapon, use Coffee on him, make him Ecstatic, have him Flex, make the boss angry, and then next turn have him use Run N' Gun on the boss. He'll do like 5000 damage in one hit.
He got no one but kel
kel
Canon
when someone asks for temperature use kelvin to establish dominance
Honestly, Kelvin and Celcius aren't that different with exception of the 273.15 offset.
> Kelvin and Celcius aren't that different with exception of the 273.15 offset. . They're identiical with the exception of the offset.
Not to mention, they probably looked up the highest speed limit in the US. 85mph is pretty rare, unless you're on some deep south country roads, so more than likely they were going 65-70mph. It's even less likely that they're going 85mph because if you're taking an interstate that has 75-80 as the speed limit (which is much more common), it doesn't have any landline poles.. . DEBUNKED
Sunny would say “Nope.”. Basil would say: “Um, Kel, I think you’re wrong...”. And Mari would smile and say: “Wow! I didn’t know this!! It’s completely true, Kel! You’re definitely right!!”
*Kel the hotdoggo RPG* unused dialog
Well kel, you just need to keep trying. Of course it's possible.. . How was that
I don’t know if she’s doing the challenge or if she just doesn’t like Kel
Not real Kel would never swear
He 100% says fuck and find it hilarious
Remember: every Kel meme is canon :)
Well… Minecraft can respawn 😎

5 days later: Kelcool has made the advancement [Cover me in diamonds]
Kel? More like Fel.
wait why does it say "kel fell from a high place" it should say "kell fell out of the world" that means there's ground below them
"KEL fell from a high place"
kel derves
All meme canons are kel
Basil doesn't really seem like the type to complain much imo. He seems like a sweet bean who'd try to see the best in everything. . . It kinda feels more likely that Kel or Aubrey might have an endless list of complaints that Sunny just sits there and doesn't mind listening for a bit.
Kel strong
**Stronk**
[Artist ](). . It’s supposed to be art post but there’s Kel so:. . **All Kel Meme are Canon**. . . ***And Sunburn is Canon***
Now we're thinking with portals!
Cave Johnson here, my father used to tell me Newton's secret law of the universe, "Every Kel meme is canon" therefore if we add Kel to every piece of fiction, it will become real. Dismissed, Cave Johnson signing out.
I havent thought about that game in years, you just reminded me it existed
Which means THERE IS MULTIPLE TIMELINES OF SUNBURN. . KEL BROKE THE UNIVERSE HE STRONGER THAN GOKU. THE CANON CANON FRUIT. . shit my weeb instincts kicking in
Kel is carrying the squad in more ways than one I see
Kel literally supporting the ship.
Kel best boy!
Dude, respect to Kel. It must take A LOT of force to lift two people on top of each other, especially for someone his age. Not to mention the balance needed so that they don’t just sloppily fall off his hands.
Kel is the /foundation/ of every ship, and the sooner we all realise that the better
It's more like kel lifting all of omori amirite. . &#x200B;. . I'll go now.
He's even lifting with his knees! You go, Kel!
This canon bc kel in it

I wouldn't have it any other way. No problem.

Everything is going to be.. burger
THE game of all time. . 
ok but he adorable!! 💕💕💕💕
FR I LOVE KEL I BREATH KEL

MAKE IT REAL!
An Omori spinoff about Kel’s life after the incident would kick so much ass.. . No, I’m not biased.
Y E S! WE NEED A DLC/SEQUEL OR SOMETHING
I know a sequel would kinda ruin the game’s open ending, but like, could I not have just the tiniest glimpse into what life is like after the Good and Bad endings? Could I have a small morsel? A scrap? A teensy little peak? Maybe even a doodle or singular sentence by any of the developers?
a prequel probably, where we follow Kel right before the incident, there are different “endings” but it all still leads to the same thing 
Hikito mod be like

holy shit hes balling in the title
Yo he's ballin in the title 😮 
Happy cake day! 
. . >!**We’re still here you know-**!<. . . . ***YOOOOOOOOOO***

I love that his name ends with a basketball hoo!
It’s Kelin’ time. Kel? You got him. No take backs.
He’s such a little cutie pie, I love him
i could play this,. . in an unironic way, . . fully fleshed out could play this
You play as a boy that, over the course of a fantastical adventure, learns that he is nothing more than a caricature of a real boy in someone else’s mind. That he is a disposable commodity in his friends’ party, dispensing comic relief at best, or Kel nukes at worst.
Kel.
Omori if it was a googame.
every kel meme is canon
I would unironically play this
He ballin'
Why can't this be real
Kelp
(enturnaly screaming)
They made Omori good
Who is Kelo?
Now that's a game I'm willing to throw a concerningly absurd amount of money at
WOAH ! Its Me (KEL)
I'm a big fan of the implication that if Kel had an alternate dream persona, it would just also be called Kel. Like of course it would.
this is so adorable look at the little mini-kel dunking
And thus began the Omori Cinematic Universe. Can’t wait to see what Phase Two has in store for us!
omori if it was good

This makes me smile every time I remember about this today
GET KEL’D! 
:
This should unironically be a game too
I’m gonna be honest here, but unpopular option: I don’t like Kel. He reminds me a lot of my ‘best’ friend growing up who was pretty gross and crass. And I don’t like basketball people! I much prefer Aubrey and her crowd.
 >!(Start running, for he approaches.)!<
. . Jarvis, somebody on the internet disagrees with my opinion. You and I both know that is a cardinal sin. Send them either photo of my genitalia or their IP address, then fill up their inbox with death threats. That oughta teach them not ti have an opinion not like mine.
you just made 90% of r/OMORI real angry

Closest thing we can get to hikikel being canon

looks like a happy game

balling
OMg, Omori 2¡?!?!?! 
Instead of murder Kel annoyed Hero a little too much
Kil
I'd be down for this. 
Wait, Kel instead of Omori.... So wouldn't Run n Gun OTK be the only strategy then?
i wish this was a real game :')
Every kel meme is canon. Waiting for the game to release.

i don’t know where to put this but i feel like kel would claim he’s not gay and then unironically kiss the homies goodnight
Kel.
 most likely
Just imagine Kel breakdancing. It helps.
Most likely
Possibly
Hopefully
There is a chance
not really
there may indeed be a possibility
Give it to kel he will eat it no matter what
He becomes the funni skeleton for a split second
Kel being the biggest "cock block" and the biggest wingman at the same time is funny.
Nah bruh homie was getting supplexed he saved him
I'm pretty sure the reason Sunny was getting suplexed in the first place is because Kel barged in, and Aubrey's 'make it look like anything but what was about to happen' instincts took over
He plays all side, to always come out on top
This is adorable, I love it. . Also kel jumpscare 
But they're already clashing Kel
she said kel is a gross color, so i guess she's racist
Everyone except Kel 
Kel lives matter ✊
Kel lives matter! 👊🏻
she said kel is a gross color
Source
The game. Kel said pink was a gross color, then she did the "No u" insult basically. It was the memory in the rainy day photos.
In the memory lane/violin mending sequence, in the rainy memory Aubrey talks about wanting to dye her hair with Mari and dye it pink. Kel says pink is a gross color. She tells Kel that he's a gross color.
No fucking way
Yes fucking way
definitely asain
White it is
she WHAT!?
She was a kid and could have just wanted a comeback
Definitely White, cause Asian wouldn’t notice that Kel is a weird color
Are you sure about that?
Homes never been to Southeast Asia
Or the Indian Subcontinent, or the Asian portion of the Middle East
Could be Siberian
I’m literally native vietnamese, fuck off
You are a tree from hell. Who are you to say what a human should be?/s
No
Asia is actually known for their bad treatment of darker skinned people lol, theres a reason why theyre obsessed with looking as white and bright as possible
My guy Latino and Hispanic isn’t any darker than Southern Chinese/Vietnamese
that doesn't change the fact that colorism is a very real thing in Asia
No it doesn’t, and no one suggested otherwise. I’m saying Latino and Hispanic or even Native Americans don’t get discriminated against on the basis of color in Asia because most of them aren’t that dark, happy?
People of any darker skin tone are discriminated against in Asia because of colorism, whether they're Latino, Asian, etc. Just look at how skin-lightening creams and sunblocks are advertised, or why people there actively try to avoid getting tanner skin. Discrimination doesn't have to be as pervasive as segregating drinking fountains for it to still be discrimination on the basis of their skin.
Get out with that generalisation lmao, I’m Vietnamese living in Asia nearly all my life and never have I heard such dogshit take.. . No idea where the fuck you are from but pale skin whilst a physical preference isn’t the main reason why for discrimination here, it’s culture and being foreign. Just like how American used to discriminate against Italians and Irish although they were light skinned, we discriminate against each other with culture first and foremost.
I'm Taiwanese and I've heard enough comments from relatives about my skin being too dark to look "pretty." I'm more surprised you haven't made the connection between classism and colorism in Asia, considering that darker skin usually meant working outdoors vs paler skin being someone with like an office job....
Have you ever gotten shit for not being able to speak Chinese? Imagine a pale skinned Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese person who doesn’t speak Chinese, vs you, a Taiwanese native that no matter how “dark” can speak Chinese going to a Chinese restaurant or looking to rent an apartment at a Chinese place, who would they favour?
Yeah, discrimination in Asian countries is a very nuanced topic - things like culture do play a part, but to pretend colorism (and colonialism) isn't at play is willful ignorance at this point. There are plenty of resources you can read up on instead of this tangent in r/Omori. Peace.
You definitely denied skin color played a part earlier in this thread lmao. I'm not saying culture comes first either, just that it's more nuanced than Westerners tend to think. You need to educate yourself better than your little bubble of personal experience. 
Damn why this guy so mad like god damn.
I'll just leave it at "theres plenty of videos on the topic"
Hispanics can be literally any color, even black (source: me, and various people i know from the dominican republic and puerto rico) Can't believe this conversation has to be had tbh.
wait what is the point that you are trying to make here...?
My best friend's family who are predominantly from Cambodia and risked their lives, as well as lost loved ones, trying to escape to the U.S. during the Cambodian genocide are very anti-black and weirder, anti-refugee. Like friends? You?? Were literally??? Refugees??????? Like her mom literally almost died on the boat over due to starvation and her uncle is a 'build the wall' 'refugees from mexico are coming to make the US more democrat' type. . . Just bc something is logical, doesn't mean people do it. Not to mention how exclusive different Asian communities can get. Same friend tried to join the Korean student association in Uni bc she's half and talked about how insular it was and how if you didn't actively speak korean you were kind of subtly pushed out regardless of your background
"Weird color" 💀
American race politics and its consequences...
she didn't mean it literally in that dialogue lmao
some of the east Asians i know are whiter than the whitest guys i know
Homie never saw LA in the 90’s
yo thats a crazy take bro lmao

\>:( Ting ting ting ting ting ting ting ting
How is kel mexican? I can see the dream world kel but really??
Kel and Hero’s house has an ofrenda, which is more common in Mexican cultures.
I take it back, dw kel looks indian
Ah, I was just working off my prior knowledge and I looked it up and Christians are a plurality (though not a majority) so she apparently could be Christian. It’s just that a Christian is much more likely to be white and Asians are quite more likely to live in urban or suburban areas
That explains her calling kel a weird colour, let’s just leave it at her grandfather being a German immigrant…
LMAO
Thanks for the award!
No problem I lol'd remembering when everyone was memeing Argentina
Why did you come to the conclusion that Hero and Kel are Latino/hispanic? Like was there something in the game that suggests it or are you just going off skin color? If anything I thought Kel was so tanned because he probably spends a lot of time outside playing sports.
>ofrenda. . I completely missed it, time for another play through
oh snap i missed that
That and they have ofrenda at home which is an offering for the Mexican holiday "Dia de los muertos"
Damn... I'm Mexican and I totally missed this
Kel gives me filipino vibes honestly
Its a joke because Kel said pink hair is gross and she said something like hes a gross color lol nothing actually personal or direct just a "no u" theres also ofrenda in their house which is a Mexican tradition for the holiday Dia de los muertos, they dont outright say it though because its not important its just fun hints and implications
Ohhh I didn’t know that!
in all seriousness, in the real world her eyes seem pretty white when it comes to shape and color. only 1% of asian ppl r blue eyed which makes it pretty unlikely that she would be asian.
her eyes are dark brown/black (you can see this in old photos of her, esp the rain one), she just wears contacts
wait rlly? i never knew, ig that further proves she might be asian.
Not that it matters but… since this is set in a small suburban town in the United States, isn’t it likely that they’re all white?
Also, I think Hero Is actually "Enrique" and Kel Is the short for "Kelvin", they both share the surname "Cervantes". . And I can imagine Sunny's surname así "Migasaki"
Idk if Kel and Hero are latinos. I just thought Kel had that west coast kind of tan that can make you mistake a white guy for a black guy
Honestly they all look white to me except maybe kel
… she said Kel was a “gross color” because Kel said her favorite color was gross. she’s not racist she’s a child. if he had said “pink is dumb” she would’ve said “you’re dumb”
I think it's inaccurate only because I don't think Aubry could afford a phone lmao (tooken from kels phone or smth)
and how he is not going to be?...all Kel did was dig his own grave XD
Kel: “Sally and I are trapped in the McDonald’s play place. We’re currently in the bubble facing the dining area. Do you see us waving to you? Please send help, we haven’t eaten our order yet.”
I love that post
Sunny: ¡¡I'm goin to (MA)MCSSACRE YOU UP KEL!!.. . Kel: ¡¡oh shit oh shit!! ***\*******starts running for his Mclife\****. . Aubrey: \*Mc sigh\* here we go again.. . I can't handle this, it's so hilarious XD
??? Is that spanish keyboard?
Si, así es :)
Reasons why Kel needs to shut the Mcfuck up.
HOW DID I NOT REALIZE KEL WAS SAYING MC BEFORE EVERYTHING.. . I'm too dumb for this app, I though sunny was just stabbing kel cause hes kel

Kel Nye the Science Guy

I didn't cry, but I involuntarily yelled "NO!" when >!Kel kicked away the flower crown.!<
All portrayals in the dreamworld or based on their real old selfs i don't get why people keep trying to avoid that is it because they weirdly ship him with kel
In the two years since writing this comment I became a Kelbrey shipper. Do with that what you will
This is very true, I respect this, whatever comes to your mind is fine by me, not all ships will be likes and some aren't likely to exist as interpretations exist.. . I respect that you like the image of healing
Wait Kel is a imagination of Sunnys mind. . So he does not have free will or ability to think bur he clearly does it so either . . A. Kel is some sort of god considering him going againist Omoris will. . B. Omori wanted this to happen
I'll take the A Option

I mean, you can't always control your dreams
C. Omori doesn't care lol
Kel is canon
big, if true
B. Im a firm believer in masochism.
Have you never had a dream before???
A for sure
Eh, everyone has their own boundaries in humor. I personally think that serious topics can raise more awareness by making jokes and therefore breaking the taboo of talking about it. . That's why I like dark humor and satire, because it does just that if it's done well. You also have to look at the intention behind a joke. In this case, it wasn't "haha racism is funny", it was "Kel wanted to paint Omori purple because he doesn't look like the others. Racism is bad." And that's a very important difference. Joking about something doesn't mean you like the thing you're joking about, it can often mean the opposite.
Alright alright you win, Seriously though I’m looking at this all in a whole new way so, thank you
Character development
Character arc
Lol your so right
Plot was cool, gameplay was ok and graphics were kinda meh, but i'd give it a solid 7/10
I'd give a +2 to story for the epic plot twist at the end
Ok fine, i'll give it a solid 8/10 for the plot twist
You're*
r/characterarcs moment. . I'm also glad for you for being able to understand things in a better way 
It's okay haha. Glad you could see it in a different way. You obviously have your heart on the right spot. Have a good day! :)
I wonder who's more rascist . Aubrey: "You're a gross color Kel". . Or Kel that literally tried to do the dream world's equivalent to black face
yes go kel leanify omori
L E A N
the most kel thing kel could ever do… maybe second to buying hero medicine as a gift.
Kel intended to say that Omori was the man behind the slaughter 
>!He’s gonna have to up his kill count if that’s the case, the animatronics aren’t going to animate themselves!<
Nice going, Kel.
“You’re a gross colour, Kel!”
KEL THAT'S RACIST
: KEL WHAT THE F-
Not very fond of people different then you, are we Kel?
kel racism arc
Racist Kel. Racist Kel
Damn, Kel being racist is canon.
Racist kel
"Every kel meme is Canon"
Kel: On second thought...
30 monks? What would Kel even do with that many monks? That's 6 whole basketball teams.
Every Kel meme is canon
kel apologize right now 😃🔪
Howdy nuts fit in yo mouth
Kel has gone too far with this one, he shall be sent to the void
Kel no!. . Don't make him cry, his mind is already in chaos as it is!. . He doesn't need more stress :(
Well, i can see Kel in this so....... yes
Kel is low key a freak
The orignal anti yoda bot may have given up but I too hate you Fake Yoda Bot. I won't stop fighting..         .          -On behalf of u/coderunner3
DAMMIT KEL
what, I had to. It was literally right there, and I took my chance.. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . And a good chance I took!!
DAMMIT KEL
kels bouta get a taste of those gardening shears

They read the Lord of the Rings books together in bed and Kel was there to witness it so it's canon
another flower language enjoyer yeaaahhhhhhhh
Do you think kel would be a btd5 or btd6 enjoyer
It's not a competition. . Although everyone knows that BTD5 is far superior, of course. The progression is more interesting when you can only use one building at a time instead of the whole tech tree at once, for instance.
Kel is a Btd4 on the DSi type of dude
Stop playing the all kel memes are canon card
The most likely explanation
actually just remembered kel saying something like "wow, it's been a while since i've been in here"
Next time on OMORI’s Wacky Antics: KEL teaches OMORI the wonders of tax evasion
*You see, the humor is derived from the fact that Kel lost his pregnant wife in a freak office chair explosion.
She’s not dead or anything. . She’s just lost

loss
Fun fact:[office chairs can explode]()
New fear unlocked
WHAT
Jokes on you, I saw it already
Nah I pissed on his wife

Kel wants to make an announcement
Yes! We need a Kel version XD
The himbo is the most emotionally stable of them all. So....
normally the bimbo isn't the shortest, and yet he is.
capitalism dont care . . \-Kel
He’s a skeleton though.
Sans isn't edgy he's the hotdog selling skeleton
The sausage skeleton
It’s a water sausage!
Wiener skeleton
pretty sure toriel would have loved that pun 
Will we bring Kel?
of course we'll bring Kel
Good, he is crucial for this operation
That's cool (--kel loves it
Kel just like me fr
YES HALF A KEL!!! HI AGAIN!!
Jesus fucking Christ Kel you can't just compare someone to Ellen like that...
Kel what the fuck
epic post but GOD DAMN kel is ripped
Omg kel, anyone but ellen DeGeneres like please... 
Where’s Kel, was he yeeted into obscurity?
Of course it is. Kel is there
kel = canon
Where is Kel?!
Tbh Gon gives Kel vibes. I feel like Killua would be Sunny, Gon would be Kel, and Leorio as Hero. Maybe Kurapika as Aubrey but that feels weird
gon definitely gives kel vibes
Wow! That’s drawn REALLY well. Nice work fellow HxH enjoyer . (Also the fact that gon has a similar look to kel is amazing)
Just imagine kel and gon interacting.
It is obviously King Kel who else
Kel must want to marry Sunny
Yeah probably, i'm pretty bad at remembering this kinda stuff so you're most likely right
Does it matter they just are american 
kel is Brazilian. Change my mind
kel is in the background, so it’s canon

We do a substantual amount of tomfoolery
i clicked it **twice**
I'm gonna kill myself I fell for this like 3 times in a row
Its actually embarrassing how i thought my reddit was glitched and restarted my laptop and then STILL tried pressing it a few times before realizing. (I didn't look at the comments)
 
Jokes on you, I didn’t fall for it!
I knew what was coming but still clicked it
i need to stop falling for these, first trollface and now trollkel.
Sorry KEL, I didn't fall for it 
I knew it was fake but I still tried anyways. Why am I so
I had to click on it twice. Dammit! You me good.
Silly Kel.
Alright fuck you \[I dont mean it\] If I was on mobile this wouldn't have worked
I already notice this by the size of 1/5 thing.
Godamnit
Everybody got “PRANKED”
I should've seen it coming.. **I SHOULD'VE SEEN IT COMING!**
this prank is gonna be crazy!

Wow I’m surrounded by idiots, they clearly don’t appreciate the numerous wonderful and witty pranks kel demonstrated.
bruh i'm not even on pc 
OP I am going to destroy you.
YOU FUCKING
took me 2 clicks to realise it's a prank 
First of all how dare you.
Take my Silver award for the love of god you stupid idiot!
I hate that I actually thought I was just missing the arrow with each click

I’m proud of myself for finally not falling for it
it took me 20 minutes to get it.
Man, I can’t even be mad at Kel, that got me good!

Boutta throw hands what 
You fucking got me even though I only use old Reddit. Made me think RES was malfunctioning.
 NOOOOO you bastard

I've fallen for this same post before yet it still took me a minute to understand
First kel nukes me then this. . geez dude
I can’t believe this got me
You’ve been Kel’d 
Oh you motherfu-
My reddit recap says that this is the post I kept visiting the most
Hey guys, Kel here, for a prank-
take my upvote and fucking leave
that if FREAKING CLEVER
to be fair, given Sunny's personality I'd imagine he respects Kel's bluntness and honesty. Since he himself is reserved and internalizes a lot, he probably really appreciated Kel's openness. . he basically says as much on the last night if you examine the friends at basil's house
a perfect combo
i bet if kel hadn't gotten bored of the flower crowns and left, sunny probably would have been too nervous to leave on his own, probably thought he'd hurt someone's feelings even though nobody actually would think that
The more I think about this-. . . . . **The more I fucking love those two**
Makes me wish that sunny was kel was his bestfriend (no offence for our flower boi)
i mean they're all best friends. kel even says as much on the last day to aubrey
Since this meme has Kel, does it mean that it's also...?
all Kel memes are...
CANON!
KEL, what the actual fuck is wrong with you? 
: HOLD THE ARMS THAT I HOLD THE LEGS KEL
Curious actually, does using more than 1 coffee on Kel do any significant changes?
Yes, his speed increases every time you use a coffee
Ohhhh ok thanks
His speed increases with each coffee, making Run 'n' Gun incredibly strong.
Ahh I see thanks
The legend of Kel. . Every Kel meme is canon
After a week of of grinding in his continual RPG dreams, Sunny is excited to tell Kel he figured out how to break the dream and get Kel to throw chicken nuggets past the speed of sound.
The way I deadass did this during the Pluto/earth fight. I use kel as a support unit but had heard about nuke kel and was like, "this seems like a good time to try it out". I sat there in shock from his 5000 dmg with a last minute scrapped together setup
:kel why do you have coffee, I thought you didn’t drink that… why are you getting closer…
Peter: "Hey kid, would ya stop banging on my door so loud?". . Kel: "Sorry sir but I sensed a great deal of depression from this house and I have to do something about it". . Peter: "Depression?? I have no clue what you're talking about!". . Meg: "Who is it?". . Peter: "Shut up Meg! Go back to your dreams so I don't have to look at you! >!I'm this close to telling the police about Chris!!<". . Meg: \*runs away crying\*. . Peter: "Nope, no depression here" \*slams the door\*
Kel Omori in Family Guy real?????
Friendly reminder that Kel = canon
Louis is adult Kel
Because If Kel is there.. it's canon..
Will we get to see Kel Omori fight the Giant Chicken?
YES
louis is kel???🤯🤯🤯🤯😳😳😳😳
KEL????!!!1!
Six tickets to Morbius. . . Kel cried when he learned that >!he didn’t actually say “it’s morbin’ time”!<
Me and the boys about to >!suppress the truth and dissociate into a headspace where It's Morbin' Time is canon.!<
Oh so that’s how that AU started
i just know kel would be asking them to do the dumbest tiktoks together
OMORBIUS: Rise of Kel
yeah, it's always a possibility. but considering all the everything else, it's more likely to be romantic.
 < i hate gay people. .  < but... ur gay?. .  < mind ur damn business kel
Kel’s
They might likely want to be your friend cause that's actually so sweet 😭
I sense kels presence, what the bell is happening in shibuya
You are my special
Kel is such a homie, idk how anyone could hate him. . . (Should probably spoiler this btw)
Yeah he's quite the charm ain't he? I mean I struggled to enjoy his company in HEADSPACE but once I saw him in RW and understood him... that's when it clicked.. . And yeah mark as spoiler... too many mistakes have been made for this sub
I liked Headspace Kel as well, he kinda reminded me of Bart Simpson, who's my favorite Simpsons character. Younger Kel reminds me of a feral puppy while older Kel is a grown Golden Retriever lol.
Right, I forgot 
kale ibs gud amd gud fer u
The legend has spoken
Kel:. . 
&#x200B;. . 
good bot
Kel is the best 
always and will forever be the best 
its canon, it has kel in it
Thank you for summarizing a point the game makes over and over again. >!Basil's appearance is meant to be deceptive. Of course, in Headspace, Omori would downplay their friendship with Kel; he doesn't want Sunny to answer Kel's call. The focus is on an Aubrey who likes him and a Hero who respects him, not on a Kel who is just... there.!<. . The message of OMORI, to me, is about what it really means to be a good friend to someone. >!It's not dying for someone, lying for someone, or even fighting for someone. It's smiling for them. Having fun for them. Maybe even annoying them. That's how you help a friend, not by suffering with them, but by enjoying yourself with them. And it's fascinating to see just how badly Basil gets it all wrong.!<
This unironically. I wish I had a friend like Kel.
what if you are the kel friend for instead 
Seems Tiring ngl, I praise anyone who could do that
Both. Both is good. . Kel is cool though
I agree. But then again Kel is also like stable mentally as well
Basil has been through worse than Kel has, so I don't really blame him for anything.... . But Kel is my fav for a reason. Bless that basketball boi.
Finally,someone with the same philosophy as me. . KEL IS SUPREMEEEEEE 

Kel Drip?
Kel is the homie
Basil's brain: trauma, Mari, Sunny, Something, more trauma, edgy | Kel's brain: 🍔 --> That's why Kel is better 😎🧡
Agreed 
Yay 
I found it sweet that when you played Hide and Seek when you first get to Headspace, Kel just stands right behind the pole you were facing. If it was an imagination, then most likely something similar happened irl.
This post has Kel in it. Therefore, not only is it canon, but it also makes Kel THE canon best friend.
Gee.
Basil is probably more fit for sunny, but it’s unfair to compare him to Kel cause KEL IS SUPREMEEE
Kel is honestly amazing. I mean, you're depressed, you just spend entire days rotting in your room and yet there's this boy who goes out of his way to knock at your door. Even if you had cut yourself off from everyone.. I relate to the protagonist so much and Kel's efforts really mean a lot I mean he really cares
I’m a Kel supremacist 
Nearly all of these comments are.
Kel didn't demonize Aubrey, he was just in his feelings...he's allowed to be mad at her, it doesn't mean he really believed it. Aubrey isn't perfect either, therefore as Hero said, "it's just your usual Kel and Aubrey fight".. . Kel most definitely didn't treat anyone the same...what!?...Hero got mad NOT because of Kel, but because he was venting his own feelings, Kel was literally trying to console him. I think you're wrong about that take on Kel, because you're painting him as the dumb one who thinks everyone is happy, when infact he was deeply concerned at Hero's depression and he never moved on the way Aubrey describes...if anything it's her who thinks he's a simpleton and takes him for granted (like literally everyone in the game, even Sunny).. . Great take for Basil, but absolute L take when it comes to Kel.
Kel can both be "in his feelings", mad for legitimate reasons, and still demonize Aubrey. That anger that causes strain is on both sides, but whether for valid reasons or not Kel doesn't afford Aubrey the idea that she may be angry still due to grief, misunderstandings or home situations, all three being the root of her actions. I don't necessarily blame Kel for his intolerance of her actions, but from the player's perspective after the situation is cleared Kel's actions certainly doesn't help the situation. . . Hero, being older and more mature, is able to rectify this by being someone who both look up to, but if not for him Kel's provocations would only force Aubrey further away rather than helping her. He doesn't know the full extent of the clash (and didnt even recognize Aubrey at the lake) but he uses their pretense of fighting as a way to get them both to make up, rather than it actually being a small squabble like in the past.. . And Hero did lash out of anger at Kel, because of what he said. In his cemetary dialogue at Mari's grave, Kel mentions that he spoke to Hero and mentioned that Mari wouldn't want to see him like that, and thats when he got angry. Kel was trying to console him, but hit a touchy spot by mentioning Mari. He was getting out his feelings, but the only reason that I can see causing a sudden emotion outburst after a long period of sadness is the mention of Mari. I would ascribe that to being angry at Kel, regardless of if Kel deserved such.. . I didn't say that Kel is stupid or doesn't think, he has a decent amount of emotional awareness, but he seems to prod at the sore spots of both Aubrey and Hero at different parts of the story by bringing up Mari as a crutch as to how they should get back to acting how they used to when she was alive. Of course, not in such an obvious or blatant wording or actions, but in his actions and words he really wants things to go back to the way they were and in a way, his expression of that signals to everyone that he's not nearly as permanently affected as the others, even if he does care about Mari and everyone elses views of Mari.. . It's not that he doesn't know people are sad, it's that hes not careful when treading such topics and as shown by the dinner scene at Basil's house, isn't super keen on reading the current situation much deeper than initial obvious emotion. Provoking others is part of his character in Headspace and whether he notices or not, he also does it in the real world.
I believe in Kel supremacy
We all need a friend like Kel
kel IS canon though
Yeah KEL is the better friend 
Kel is chad as fuck 
I unironically dislike Basil and Kel, but I prefer Kel by far
Listen, I'm bias to Kel and Hero so I'm gonna agree with this post but also I just don't like Basil. . . Don't get me wrong. Love his design. He's got a cool story but I just don't enjoy him as a character (maybe thats just some inner thing with me) everytime he was on screen I just couldn't help but be uncomfortable?? Idk . . I enjoy Kel as a character because he's someone I would want to be/be friends with. He reminds me of myself (probably why I'm bias)
If I remember right, in the omori route, after learning red hands, enter the neighbour's room and speak with Kel. He gives you a present for being his best friend, a 'brother's handshake' to dub you as an honorary brother.
Kel is the only reason that you could get the good ending in the game, you wouldn’t have gone out if he didn’t knock, just saying
Kel is just the best person you can have, KEL IS PERFECT  (and Basil scares me-)
Kel is a real homie, the kind of guy who always has your back.
My bf has a similar personality to Kel's.... . It's chaotic sometimes... 
how do you nuke pole with Kel
He means Kel nuke
Everyone needs a Kel in their life
Kel was a ride or die from day one, if there was a friendship meter like in stardew for fw I 100% would’ve maxxed it. . Also they fit the “quiet soft friend and loud outgoing friend” troupe which is a personal favorite
kel is the guy
Kel is seen as a brain rot but is criminally underrated
pumpkel
No Kel, not canon 😭
Kel's the one dressed as a pumpkin.
Oops, i thought that was... i dont even know anymore
Here's a wattpad link if you're still interested:  [A Visitor In Their Dreams - Kel - Wattpad]()
Thank u so much 
np 
I love Kel
Super smash bros, nickelodeon All Star Brawl, Multiversus..... . . Now we just need a fighting game with these characters 👀
Brad and kris are in muggen
I don't think that's mold. Based on what it looks like Sunny is most likely wearing a tank top, which is sleeveless. Sometimes the holes where the sleeves would go are long, so the "mold" is most likely just the side of his torso shadowed.. . I have no idea why he's not wearing shoes tho-
Kel looks like he's about to commit some goofy acts
Kel ligit went goblin mode
Wait that art is cannon?!. . I didn’t know! I love it even more 😭. . Like the fact that BASIL tries to help her get down while SUNNY’s just watching and eating his ice cream, and KEL just being KEL… we need more of those please
what the HELL is kel doing 😭😭
kelbrey is actually a ship name lol
NOOOO ITS TRUUUUEEEE
We all know the rule... all kel memes...
**NO!**
But when there's two Kels.... . The canonization gets cancelled
Wouldn't that just make it more canon?
Not if one Kel uncanons it
But a counter-meme with one Kel would only cancel out one of the Kels, meaning there is still one more left and therefore making it still canon. You would require either multiple Kels or multiple counter-memes to be able to cancel it out completely.
I have more Kels
And if there's 3?
Madness ensues if one disagrees
SHUT
You mean baseball?
yeah, both names are used interchangeably

Nice!
it became 70 😔✌️ gotta downvote
N i c e
why does kel look like a brand new character
cuz he always has been.
kelbrey my beloved
kel with a bow is what i dream of every night
kelbrey and aubel look so normal its creepy
While I agree, since I'm in full blown "saving cool artwork until your hard drive can't contain anything else" mode, I noticed that it's Kel that's sorely missing artistic representation. A real shame, considering how many fun situations he could be in art-wise and how important he is to the story.
Just gonna say, probably avoid any fandoms till you beat the game (there are 2 main endings). Likely to get spoiled
Kel is the best character
Based + kel pilled
And this marks the day I join the Omori fandom. . . Where every Kel meme is canon
Yayyy welcome
y’know, i just realized… this is the dumbest fucking conversation i’ve had today.. . the Kel nuke lets you skip bosses without need for skill. no fucking shit. that’s why i brought it up IN THE FIRST PLACE. you’re not going to change my mind by explaining my own point back to me.. . and trust me… i’m the last person that’s ever going to care about how a game is “supposed” to be played.
i wasn’t angry, i just couldn’t make the italics work so went with caps. in retrospect i probably should’ve used a tone tag.. . but enough about me, let’s talk about you.. . acting like you don’t care, throwing insults, trying to play the “why are you mad?” card… i think we’ve just about reached the end, don’t you? . . yeah this is why i don’t usually see internet arguments through; they always end up like this.. . … though to be honest, it’s probably about time this one ended. i mean we have a picture of Mari in the mirror, and you look in the comments and we’re just rage-debating about the Kel nuke. like why.
..?. . dude, it’s over. why are you still here?
i’d welcome change. these people are all the same, and it’s lost its charm.
maybe... what?. . adhd goblin brain is bad with implications.
fair enough.. but maybe we should wrap this up soon. like i said, this is an odd conversation to have on a post like this.. . it was nice talking to you once we got off the subject of Kel nukes.
Well, Rest in peace, deleted user
Judging by the look on her face it's likely that she wants some sort of revenge; by the way she's standing behind him, maybe not that far at least saying that she holds a grudge that she wants to push him back or is simply feeling disappointed  
Kel fans (me) are gonna be eating good next episode
TRUE
I'm so excited for his thoughts I love Kel
personally disagree with the argument that a lot of his behaviors are explained away by the trauma he's endured. some, yes, especially what the phobia fights represent, but the game explicitly tells and shows us a lot of that can be explained by neurodivergence.. . -being so soft-spoken and deliberately choosing not to speak even before the game's events that he would diagnostically fall under "selective mutism." there are many reasons children and adults both do this, but ASD is a common reason.. . -preferring small enclosed spaces. many NDs do this as a comfort thing to close out the overwhelming sensations of the world around them.. again, kids also just do that, but combined with everything else he certainly comes across as ND.. . -flat affect/difficulty showing emotions. again, even before his trauma and hikikomori lifestyle would've stunted his emotional development, he's shown to be *extremely* hesitant to show his emotions, even to his closest friends and family. not only is this common in ASD, it's also common in schizotypal disorders. schizotypal people are more prone to hallucinations/delusions/psychosis as well, as a sidenote. he appears to feel emotions in a big and impactful way, so it is not that he is unfeeling, it is that he has extreme difficulty showing them until it all boils over. this applies to both negative and positive emotions, as seen through a few key events in the Sunny route.. . -maladaptive daydreaming and anxious attachment style. these two are a bit more conjecture, but they are at least implied. his daydreaming doesn't appear to be detrimental until after the inciting incident admittedly, but he is shown to be effectively attached at the hip to mari throughout. he's also unable to leave the house on his own as a teen, needing kel to practically drag him out.. . there are other small tidbits, and all of this doesn't necessarily say "he is intended to be autistic." he is likely written to be some form of neurodivergent, as this seems to have been Omocat's intent all the way back to the Omoriboy blog.. . TL;DR to answer OP's "is he autistic coded?" yes, as coded just means displays traits associated with autism. intended to actually be autistic or ND? maybe, but no confirmation.. . (i myself am an adult with both ASD and SCZ diagnoses, and have done many deep dives into the DSM-V and other psychology texts and journals about these and related disorders.)
i have a soft spot for neurodivergent headcanons so i'm gonna say yes (as someone with adhd i also like the adhd kel headcanon)
Alot people Just project themselfs into characters. . Is cool for you to have a character that you can feel like you relate. . But sometines It turns a problem to others bcuz   some people treat their headcanons as canon and they are Very likely not true lel

Neither does she have manners. Nobody really holds the cup with the small finger straight. It’s a kind of ‘fact’ that I have seen way too often practiced in the society.
>Nobody really holds the cup with the small finger straight. . . R-really? But I do... Don't hate me, it just feels like it helps the grip when you can't use all fingers, and these tiny slippery polished handles that provide no leverage unlike tall handles on mugs really are a pain
Can I get uhhhh, boneless doughnut.
theres no skeleton, just jelly
That made my bones itch
That made my bones feel wonderful! I wish I was jelly on the inside…
"That made my bones feel wonderful" is my newest favourite Internet phrase 🤣
After rereading this comment, I see how bad a take this is. . . Alternate take: I don’t think she even has a skeleton, I think all of it’s just dough
Plot twist: There is no spine, mo skeleton at all; her internal structure is basically just Mutantheart-esque jelly giving her form.
Her body is actually an exoskeleton (or something similar to slugs/snails)
This is the real answer if you consider that donuts are most rigid on the outside.. . She must be very flexible, though... And now I can't stop thinking how she can use her own donut hole to poke her head through, like one of those cardboard cutouts... Oh god
If donuts don't have spines, then why do mochi donuts look like a donut's skeleton
exoskeleton
exoskeleton
Jelly acts like hydraulic fluid. Her whole skeleton ia actualy jelly creating hydrostatic force to make her structures hard (just like plants but its jelly)
I like to imagine she’s having trouble clearing the fence. Basil is overwhelmingly concerned, even offering to catch her. Sunny is confident she can make it over herself. And Kel is being Kel.
kel is giving "im going to do a backflip i swear just watch give me a second aw i just did it and you missed it too bad cant do it again" vibes in this pic
its most likely because sweepheart radiates so much hatred while perfectheart is just standing there
Kel is Ness
This was my desktop background for about half a year till I swapped to my Xeno 3 one.. I love everything in here.. Mari being like a big sister for Aubrey, Hero looking at her appreciating how lucky he is with her, Kel being Kel as always with Aubrey reacting to the Kel-ism as usual, Basil being the Kind shining soul helping Sunny up and on top this insanely well crafted treehouse.. One image says all about what I love seeing this group of friends.
I can't pick a single desktop background so I have it on slideshow mode lmao
Kel decorating Hector. . 
Second page. . 
Ah damn I forgot that. Thanks for sharing!
Hard to pick but i like how kel is suffering here (Hes one of my favorites). . 
the Kel april fools post immediately took over whatever was my favorite before
Kel becomes the new meta pyro
Kel and Yanfei playing catch with fireballs
WHERE THE FUCK IS GENSHIN KEL
Genshin Kel is Bennett
MY NAME IS HECTOR, KEL, I WANT SOME SNO-CONES. HECTOR,, THAT IS MY NAME, HECTOR I WANT ANOTHER, HECTOR.
You aced it with Kel’s dad
You sure cooked.... But you burnt the whole damn meal lmfao (kels would be pretty accurate tho)
i personally gave Stanley Kubrick the script in his grave. now there's this weird skeletal guy outside my house telling me to return the script or suffer his curse
"ARFARFARFARFARFARFARF" -kelshowsspeed
A detail that supports this is “Kel is known to spill his drinks.” being removed, since it’d remind him too
He missed the chance to be #hip and change it to ”Kel is known to spill tea” or ”spit straight facts” smh.
wokemori didn't gaslight gatekeep girlboss this time
Gaslight gatekeep girlboss*
thanks
"gaslight" is not a real word are you insane
well "insane" isn't a real word
IT ISN'T?!! 
And looking at the official height chart, you can assume that Kel took that advice to heart
Considering that Orange Joe is >!a denizen of HEADSPACE!<, it would be pretty weird for Kel to drink >!him!<.
The real answer
Kel drink milk. Grow big.. . 
That ain’t milk Kel
So what is it
💀
glue
The Good Ending.
he just wanted Kel drinking milk because funi
I think it’s a matter of. . •Sunny remembers a photo of Kel drinking, but not remembering what. . •Sunny remembers that Kel is literally the only person that drinks Orange Joe. . •”Oh, Kel was probably drinking Orange Joe”
OMORI had to cut him off, KEL had too much.
It’s because theres a character named Orange Joe in headspace and it would be weird if Kel drank Orange Joe whilst a character named Orange Joe existed. Wouldn’t it?
Kel 
Unironically did this on my first playthrough because it totally went over my head. I was like "yeah Kel would probably appreciate pizza and the moon is ball shaped and Kel uses ball weapons-". . Idk I thought maybe I'd get a special item
everyone but kel in my *gang* would be named after some immature portuguese word. > “PIROCA steps forward”, . > “PINTO has become toast!”, . > “XOXOTA uses LIFE JAM on PINTO!” . . kel can just be ligma
That's interesting, but me? I'd name everyone:. .  Leonardo. .  Raphael. .  Michelangelo. .  Donatello. .  Splinter. .  April
profile picture checks out
SO CUTE!! (Hold on imagine of Kel has a smol basketball!)
KEL SHALL BE MIIIINE
gonna make out with the kel one
I NEED KEL PLUSHIE
No, they're more likely based on the Smith and Wesson 4506.
"Kel don't go to school tomorrow"
CRAZY 😭

"Kel took my knife... guess I'll resort to my other option...". *CHIC-CHIC* gun sounds
Ok but is noone going to say how Kel's feet are actually huge lol
This implies that Kel has a really big skull
He needs one to fit his big brain, which he uses for all of his big brain plays!
Big Brain energy
Kel took that personally lmao
As he should /j
Kel's a tall cactus he's still growing
Yeah, he really got them catcus legs.
Them pricklies
Kel is a giant confirmed
GIANTS!

Cultured
I see you also have seen the conspiracy iceberg videos
Wendigoon is great
Mmhmm, I especially love his deep dives of certain horror series
Indeed I wasn't expecting anybody to get it, much less OP themselves. Good on you for being a person of culture OP
Kel is just trying to make his brother feel good. Kel has extendable stilts implanted into his legs and he can change his height whenever he feels like it
Kel is canonically smaller than Hero, it's Kel meme law
I'm screaming in agony, this cannot be!
But it is, search your feelings, you know it to be true
But....no! This simply cannot be true!
 Ohoho, but look at the evidence, it's clear as day
I refuse! I refuse to believe this!
: Hi! It's me! Kel from the hit game Omori! I'm actually shorter than Hero!
^(That's not the real him...he would never say that...)
: Hey so... this is the real Kel here to say that it's unfortunately true...
oh no.... . I can believe this. A sad day for all Kelkind...
 A sad day indeed, rest in pepperonies...
This unfortunate moment shall be remembered for all time...
Right here in the Kel meme archives
Bro why is Kel so fucking big.
it's all that orange joe he's drinking
Then that proves that orange joe is a hardcore drug, get me in on some of that.
Orange Joe ring
He tol
Cause he Kel
That kid probably has to crouch to go through a door frame man
Hey, least he looks cool doing it
Okay but SINCE WHEN DID KEL HAVE LEG HAIRS LMAO
Since he read somewhere that having leg hair makes you taller.. . &#x200B;. . Clearly didn't work lol
Since puberty I guess...
He always has? That's his full body image sheet thingy idk 😭 
Kel will be the tallest in my heart
Unfortunately your heart isn't canon /j
Damn, Kel is his own worst enemy
Kel, you know the pic is undoctored
I always forget just how tall Kel is.
Same
But if every kel meme is canon that means...
What are those spikes on Kel's legs?
leg hair lmao
Pricklies
Cactus spikes
OBJECTION! Kel is opening his legs thats gotta make him at least 3 centimeters shorter
Overturned! Why would Kel purposefully slouch to be shorter than Hero if he was taller?
Why wouldn't he pose for a photograph?
Big F for Kel
Kel should shave his legs
kels height scares me
ALSO KEL IS IN Q WIDE STANCE, FEET APQRT BROS TALLJER
I don't like the way Kel is looking at that knife...
He's been playing too much ultrakell

hi my otherself
Hi piece of shit. I hate you past me. And i hate future me too. (Nah only past me)
k
Ok you start.
Started what?
Started the conversation.
K
You typed first.
Yes. I had a conversation(really smol conversation) with myself
Ugh. That's the one thing I don't know how to do.
Just talk to yourself like you would do to a real person. Imagine in your mind you and yourself and both of you staring at the other you and start talking about something you want to talk to. Fun fact: talking to yourself as an introvert is like being extroverted. I mean it's literally you.
It really is interesting to see how some users react to things.
Yes. I love observing things. See the things and analyze them. Noticing detalis. Doing description in my mind cuz im too lazy to write and it would be too long too. Describing my feelings.
What do you like to draw?
Nothing since i don't draw very well :/ but if i think about it i would like to draw birds and imaginary characters in fiction or whatever it comes to my mind. Oh whatever comes in my mind too. Like the most random thing. Once i thougth about a banana bruh gun. A banana that is a gun and the texture is the bruh image of the black dude in tribunal. Basically a banana that shoots a sound. The bruh. Imagine someone taking it and pointing to you for then hearing "BRUH"
Think about what? I'm sorry, but I'm not sure what you are talking about.
I thought about what i would like to draw if was good at drawing. Sorry for long commentts and me not being understable.
Sure. Do you believe in God?
I believe in god i pray but i have my dounts about it's existence. I really wish it exists. Btw i think people can use he it she since god can be represented by an old man or a woman or a big big light. So it doesn't really matter what you use
Does god exist?
Idk. We cannot verify it's existence. I only wish for it's existence
I don't have a valid metcard.
What is a metcard?
I don't know what it is.
Bruh
Do you think?
Of course. I think a lot
What do you think about?
My life. The things of my life like videogames
What's your favorite game?
Dark souls 3
Oh that's also my favorite too.
👍+w
We have so much in vommon.
👍
I meant to say common.
Ik
Okay.
Prepare thyself
Living life as a caffeine catalyzed wmd will make anyone crazy
$60 each but if you bundle you get all 6 for $300! I making this up but it most likely going to be absurdly expensive!
Yeah i thought she was Kel for a moment lol
...but she has hair in the image? it's just kel-shaped
"Pats whenthekel's head" Now you should be happy, not poor 
im still poor but thanks 
Well, I did everything I could. You're welcome, have a good time 
As good as the new Omori plush is, Omor is still better, hence why I want Kel.
kel come home!!!!
Kel is the mvp he solos

KellethTheIII
Basil is definitely weakest, partially because his mental health is shattered and partially because he is a genuine twig. Sunny is small, but I don’t think he’d hold back at all in a fight. Kel is middle, because he’s an athlete. Aubrey is above Kel, because she’s pissed all the time and has fighting experience. Hero is the strongest, because he is a grown ass man and the rest are still kids
Basil has at least been getting out, Sunny has not left his house for many months and not interacted with anyone for years. He is so malnourished and unaccustomed to eating food that he gets sick from eating a high quality steak that would be fine dining to most people. His body literally doesn't have the energy to create more than the bare minimum amount of muscles. He can't even throw punches, I think he legitimately just slaps people in the fights, he does so much less damage than Kel. He's definitely more likely to actually fight people though, he has a lot of confidence from ~~kicking people's asses~~ stabbing people to death as Omori. Basil would just run away or curl up in a ball.
If Ev. Stat ever existed, I think Kel would have 50% More than average
Plus he does morning jogs every day. He probably stays active in other ways too, but it just never came up in-game. I think the Headspace version of him had exaggerated weakness just to make Headspace Kel look more sporty.
>!he did still beat Basil. Plus, Kel isn’t a meat shield. In the fight Aubrey chooses to target Kel first; and a meat shield (or human shield) is people deliberately placed in or around combat targets to deter an enemy from attacking those targets. It’s not like Kel is standing in front of Sunny the entire time.!<
I'm pretty sure I saw her do 50+ damage to Kel at one point in the church fight, and Kel has greater defense than Sunny.
She's angry and Kel is angry, that's +atk for her and -def for Kel. If it's in the playground, she'll only rarely deal over 40 damage and if she does, she'll probably let him get the hp back cause her hit rate is kinda garbo
Nah, it’s without weapons, and Kel’s a big tall strong sports boy, while Aubrey is *(likely)* malnourished and doesn’t exercise nearly as much as Kel. Kel definitely has more muscle than Aubrey
Aubrey easily beats kel in game though. She doesnt even use her weapon while kel just throws basketball balls
I always thought Kel was shorter than Sunny for some reason
The what? 
Makes sense. Kel Is much faster than he himself Is strong
Honestly I would argue that Kel and Hero are pretty even in strength. But that Hero is slightly stronger. . . Hero fights with his hands in battle, where as Kel fights with a basketball, and Hero did beat him in arm wrestling when he was a kid. . . However Kel is also insanely fast and is an athlete. . All we know for Hero is that he jogs every morning and is able to save two teenagers from drowning and then carry one of them on top of that.. . Of course, there’s not to mention the advantage of being an adult, whereas Kel is only 16.. . Side note: people underestimate Basil because he’s less likely to want to fight someone, gardening that many plants would give Basil a decent workout and muscle gain, and he goes out more than Sunny. Not to mention. That both Sunny and Basil collapsed on the floor when their fight ended. And considering that I don’t think Basil initially was attacking Sunny, and was still able to hurt him, that he’s stronger than what he thinks he is. . . Sunny on the other hand is more like Aubrey, where he is more likely to throw hands despite being incredibly weak
Actually, for high quality art books these prices are pretty normal. Not to mention this is actually 2 separate books totalling 350+ pages if I recall. It's definitely a lot of money and I'll likely pass, but it's not all that absurd for what you're actually getting if the quality holds up. Especially coming from a smaller art studio.. . EDIT: Words
Same. It's a bit on the pricy end, but not beyond what I expected for this. Collectors things like this tend to be pricy anyway. It will be likely scanned and passed around anyway.
She is likely doing this to make The price higher because there’s probably people who just really want the art book like me but who will buy it because of how much they want the art book and it’s kind of just price gouging and it’s kind of fucked up to be honest
Tbh probably noone would buy the walkthrough if they were sold separately
Of course, because most of the fans have already played the game, especially if it's been one and a half years since the release -.- why would we need a walkthrough if we've already played it?
Yeah the walkthrough book is pretty stupid 
Yeah and she definitely knows that
$70 for an artbook is honestly not that expensive.. . Some Taschen books are $100+, some rarer ones are even more.. . I doubt she’ll produce these forever, so theyre likely to appreciate.
At least Kel didn’t turn around…
Oh poor Kel,he tried his best to reconstruct his friend group but in this situation he failed.. . Can we give Kel a orange joe and a pepperoni pizza from Gino's pizza along with a golden medal?
Thank you. I am sad now
*We are sad
*soviet anthem plays*
r/SuddenlyComunism
𝕄𝕪 𝕒𝕟𝕥𝕙𝕖𝕞!!!
our anthem
Can we hug Kel
You can high five him, and that feels just as gratifying.
No I want to hug him
me too
Who doesnt want to hug him
nobody
it also doesn't really makes sense for kel to know that you're standing there and not doing anything
I mean he's skinny af and probably doesnt wear shoes at home so he wouldnt be that loud, and its not like Kel is in a corridor and could hear anything going on inside
I wouldnt be suprised if he forgot to walk in 4 years
I think that dialogue plays if you choose to go back into the house after initially coming out (but my memory might be mistaken, as I have a doubt that Kel might not let you back into your house)
You can stay home after having gone out the first day. You’re actually able to look at the photo album, and all of the photos have been scribbled out.
wait what
i tried that, he just stops you from going inside
So my doubt was correct... but I remember seeing a video where Kel said this dialogue, just don't remember where
I think they mean when you choose not to go outside on 2 days left.
[He still doesn't say anything then]()
Can we acknowledge the fact that this would've meant that Kel knew was Sunny was there and just thought to respect his need for space god dammit Kel you best boi
you should be locked up in jail
my day has been ruined, I didn't know that people who actually went for Hikikomori existed
Insert Mitski*
Nooobody no-bo-dy nobody nobody Oooo^ooo nobody no-bo-dy no-bo-dy
I bet on losing dogs
I hate you
If this is not cut in the final, the player after not opening the door for Kel for the first time becomes guilty and opens the door for him
Sad KEL memes: =)
Thanks the feeling of it all came back : (
liek if u cri evri tiem.
This is canon because it ripped my heart out and stomped on it
stop immediately
I wish they kept that dialogue so it would let people know kel wasn't going to be a scary ghost like mari was on the first night and make them want to go back to their save file and open that door.
What possessed you to do this to us
Hwhwhwywyhwywhy.
I was already sad before, during, and after not opening the door. I don’t know what I would’ve done seeing this.
Im so happy they removed that this is sad
Tyank you for breaking my heart
F
Born to cope
Oooof
Looking away is just a normal thing some people do when they're kinda sad, I'm guessing Sunny does it because he's not that expressive and Hero tries to bottle up his emotions. Kel's depressed portrait is probably just that way because all the unused real world battle sprites are just recycled talksprites that are given an animation, and him looking to the side is the saddest he ever looks (I'm also guessing that Kel bottles up his sadness sometimes, he just seems the type)
Oh, yeah definitely... >!during the route in which Basil dies, Kel actually starts to cry which even his depressed sprite in the dream world only got close to crying but, never genuinely cries, Kel for once actually has tears dripping down his face, and asks why this always happens to them so, yeah... he most likely bottles up his sadness, even Sunny's mother says he seems lonely which makes sense as their whole group broke apart, and then Hero went off to college, Kel most likely gets his energy from being social(, basically he's an extrovert) thus why he sort of escaped into sports and making new friends in his school however I imagine hearing that Sunny is moving would sort of make him feel nostalgic over his old friends who he probably feels closer to than any new friends he has since he knows they've all struggled which would naturally make an empathetic person such as Kel feel closer to them, plus we've seen that he cares about Basil almost immediately when he goes to stop Aubrey from picking on Basil with Sunny so, it's not like he forgot about them or, anything... he cares for them but, he can't unite them by himself(, he even needed Hero's help to unite with Aubrey again as he struggles to see both sides of a story, all he sees is Aubrey is being mean to Basil thus Aubrey is the bad guy here even though it's not a black, and white situation although he has matured this is his only flaw I'd say), him getting Sunny to leave is actually how he gets the group together again even if it was just something small, and I imagine he thinks nothing of it, it had a big effect...!< anyways Kel is my favourite character in the game if you couldn't tell, hah.
Is Kel's name leo????? What???
whoops typo, i’ll edit it lol
Well if you look at your keyboard, you can see that next to "K" is "L", and next to "L" is "O", so while they meant to type *Kel*, they typed *Leo* accidentally hitting two of the wrong keys.
what do u mean?
someone typoed and accidentally called Kel "Leo"
holy shit a whole year later dude hahahha
lol
Muhahahahaha

i like how kel just becomes espurr
Maybe something to do with him shutting off for a while before losing it on kel
I think there is a simpler answer: Spiders n' bugs.
I've always why Kel's eyes go whiter when he's Afraid Or Enraged
Bro I took the screenshot so fast that the like animation didn't even finish smh
"i am speed" moment
Kel moment

YUH
broooo 3 of friends birthdays are coming up and its going to be my moms birthday all in september I DONT HAVE MONEY I CANT-
My wallet is screaming at me in anger

My wallet just went down the stairs.
i can feel my money being stripped away from me already
and kel is the best character because he >!messaged everyone ultimately saving their friendship!< right??
jeez don’t get into detail these are major MAJOR spoilers
Somebody mod this into game
>!don't tell them about what kel does...!<
no one tell him that kel is the true savior of this world and shall cleanse all of your grief
Kel will be mean to her 
>!Oh, *something* is going to happen alright... and it might be Kel trying to cook!<
Kel fucking explodes
I can’t wait for the kel one
so when’s the kel perfume coming in?
But would it smell like kel? Lol 😭
Canon even without Kel. . Or is it canon because Kel is Hero's brother?
Eh, as far as we are concerned it is most likely canon given it could happen in the first place
Kel’s dad would like a word lol
Yeah he’s nice but not so prominent in the game
Kel
Kel.. . WHEN THERE'S NO CASH TO SPEND
Um >:o
What's wrong, coping?
Kel. “Every kel meme is cano-“ . SHUT. ITS NOT FUNNY. JUST ANNOYING
Dw kel
*bit Kel*
kel tastes like orange joe, very well fitting for him 👍
Coach and Kel would be great friends
"imma be a one man cheeseburger apocalypse" 
Kel = orange and coffee
I'm eating kel right away if he tastes like lemons
Kel tastes like orange joe, he's got orange joe in his veins.
I refuse to believe Kel isn't just the physical incarnation of Orange Joe.
kel tastes like banana peel
Nah bro kel tastes like pickles and mustard, trust me
how could you not get this kel tastes like orange
Kel tastes like Orange Joe
They both have a brother >! and are a skeleton !<  . .  case closed
Pretty sure you gotta delete the spaces from the spoiler tags lmao
"who's ready for the omori movie, starring chris pratt as kel"
this comment wins... 
"faraway town, heeere's yooouurrr pizzaaa"
Every other actor is an actual teenager
NOOOOOO
I think you misspelled "Kel"
I always said that Kel is the perfect aroace icon lmao
No, he’s just THE icon. For anything.
i'm glad everyone sees my vision on this one
Kel being aroace would improve Omori as a game tenfold and I am not biased in the slightest, definitely not
I can totally see Kel as aroace 😌
For one thing, I’m more than sure both of her parents would likely disown her, because I‘m pretty sure they were decent parents before the whole pizza incident. Sunny would definitely be getting immediate therapy and likely not create headspace and isolating himself, and everyone would be supporting Sunny with his trauma.. . Edit: Forgot the part where Mari goes to prison/Juvie and likely dies there, given how most prisoners don’t take kindly to child abuser’s!
oh hell yeah, would definitely be a shorter au but thats fine 
it seems you have forgotten the "you're a gross color, Kel" incident
Oh no... You're right.
Still caught me off guard when I was playing the game
Idk it just seems like the dumb sorta comeback that a 12 year old who couldn’t think of an actual response would say.. . It’s basically just “your stuffed animal is stupid” “no it’s not, your stupid!”
I mean she was 12. I doubt the colour of kels skin even crossed her mind when she said that, and it certainly didn’t cross kels ether since his response was “that doesn’t even make any sense”. It was probably literally that she just said the first comeback that came into her head because saying nothing means kel wins the argument, and that first thing was something that, as kel points out, “doesn’t even make any sense”.. . If someone older said something similar then yeah, it may raise a few eyebrows as being kinda sus, but a 12 year old? That’s just a kid saying something dumb that they don’t understand could be misinterpreted as something kinda racist.
It’s funny though, so she’s racist.
Nah she's racist as hell 
“You guys missed the point if the game.”. . That’s it.. . Edit: also this. . “Ps. The memes aren’t helping, so we retract the Kel memes = canon comment. Have a swell day”. . I feel like saying this would probably cause a bit on a uproar lmao
Who knew the game wasn't meant to make you depressed?
I mean like, the message was meant to be vague on purpose in order to anger the fandom lol.
I would tweet that kel hates orange joe and only drinks it for social pressure
"Kel is fake."
Whatever you’re doing is likely better than what I could come up with. Writing in general is just so out of my field of expertise to commit to outside of mandatory classes. Though if you’re going to leave something unfinished, PLEASE don’t stop at an unsatisfying cliffhanger! 
*Looking at old unfinished fics* Ahahaha I would never–
*Gasp* You monster!
Channelling my inner Omori 
Channeling my inner >!Something!< 
Oh I thought we were exchanging unlikely scenarios
Kel is that you
Kel. . . Jokes aside, I think they would alternate being the big spoon.
Kel is Matpat
Kel is a genuine buffoon, we all know FNAF 2 comes BEFORE FNAF 1. His summary of FNAF 4 was correct aside from the box, which was sorta explained in the books. FNAF 1 the og Phone Guy dies and gets stuffed into one of the spare suits, the main 4 characters are all haunted and by this point Golden Freddy apparently has two spirits inside of him, according to the books anyway. I understand the books are a debated topic but I like to consider them canon in a different timeline, but helping to provide context for the original. Anyway, in FNAF 1 nothing of note happens and the animatronics stay haunted, 3 is when things start to ramp up, the original FNAF 1 cast are dismantled, William gets springcocked, the souls get freed except for the puppet and Cassidy (so the og cast along with the toy animatronics are freed) and Michael attempts to kill William but fails. 4 is the first in the timeline beside Sister Location but that’s already been explained.. . I just realized I was fully prepared to explain the entire FNAF lore even though I doubt anybody wants to listen.
"I'm not a buffoon! How about you try explaining it Hector! "
nah we all know kel is sans
Welcome back to Game Theory where today we will be uncovering the secret of Kel's past as sans.
Future*. . Clearly kel got cancer, died and became sans
hey speaking of kel getting cancer want a heartbreaking fic where he does?. . 
>I rlly don't care for kel that much. . . . (Top ten references)
“You’re not understanding. You get both condiments so you can have savory or sweet depending on how you feel-“. . “Kel you’re such an idiot. Mustard is for stuff like chicken tenders, or pretzels. Ketchup is for burgers.”
I completely side with kel
Chicken tendies w/ mustard is disgusting.
I agree with normal mustard, honey mustard though 🤤
No it's not, GooseHonker! You're disgusting!
opinions
Yours is bad. That's my opinion
ok 👍
" The pickle is part of the burger,don't waste your food kel!"  . " NO! IT'S DISGUSTING!"
whoever genuinely likes crunchy pickles on their burger is disgusting
ok 😔
😞
Hey I’ll admit I’m disgusting but it is definitely not because of my pickle preferences
Then... what else?
Shinji hand liquid
I disagree. The pickle is the most scrumptious delicious delicacy known to humankind.The rich, crunchy flavor with the sweet and sour feeling is utterly divine. Those who cannot taste the goodness of the pickle are simply lower class beings, incapable of enduring the overwhelming flavor in which it brings.
Except the sweet pickles those are yuck
I don't care much if there's a pickle on the burger or not, TOMATOES ON THE OTHER HAND
I will not allow any disrespect towards tomatoes. Fight me, Helen.
I have no idea who Helen is but tomatoes are icky ew gross, they make everything soggy and are just ew no. . If they're cut up into small pieces (not slices) or processed in other ways they're fine, but raw tomato is just not good in my eyes. . Edit: They're also not good in my mouth
you just got unlucky with your tomatoes. . you can definitely have fresh tomatoes that aren't soggy at all. issue is that tomatoes are one of the hardest vegetables to grow properly, they are super prone to disease or poor growth
SMH Kel would never cyberbully
It's absolutely disgusting, pineapples on the other hand... ^^/s
bro just let us have our opinions about burger toppings
Mine isn't crunchy what would that mean?
Still disgusting because all pickles suck
Cool im disgusting then lets
*cries*
No u
Why must you bully me
based
Fr whenever I'm at Mc or BK, I always tell them beforehand that I don't want any pickles on my burgers. Pickles are absolutely rancid.
no kel gave the pickle to sunny
I am weird about burgers, but I like (tolerate) vegatables and pickles  and I love burger patties and buns, but I can't stand when both are combind together.  To me, the crunch and water content of the veggies throws out the soft umami taste of the burger patty.  I usually take the condiments off and eat them with my side salad (or by themselves) and enjoy the soft juicy burger in almost isolation (it goes good with the bun though).
Kel would never
He looks like a kid that hate Vegetables
“Alright Kel we get it you have burgers on your mind.”
she is mad at kel because of that disgusting [thing]() kel posted on twitter
If Kel has Uno on his Xbox
kel didnt get pickles on his burger
Are Kel memes actually canon or not?
Aubrey: "Kel the current inflation is a good thing". . Kel: "HELL NO! LET'S GO BRANDON!"
“We got ketchup mixed with lettuce cheese!”. . “KEL, it’s a burger for gods sake!”. . “AND I GOT BURGERS ON MY MIND! WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT?”. . “KEL, DON’T EVEN SING IT!”
they're arguing over if kel makes everything canon or not
"No you don't get it, I usually eat it with the shell". . "KEL IT'S A HAMBURGER IT DOESN'T HAVE A SHELL". . "Then why would they make it with the white crispy thingy?". . "THAT'S FUCKING WRAPPING PAPER YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT IT". . "BULLSHIT, IT MAKES THE HAMBURGER CRISPIER". . "KEL W H Y"
“Orange Joe would go well with this!” . . “Oh heck no, that’s gross Kel! Orange Joe doesn’t go good with anything because it’s not good at all!” . . “Oh yeah? Maybe you just have bad taste, Aubrey!” . . “Well Kel, maybe your taste just sucks!” . . Fun dialogue in my head
Kel: "A pregnant person is technically an Arachnid.". . Aubrey: "KEL NO!!"

KEL NO-
Eh, a bit too vague. Recognizable to mildly devoted Omori fans, but probably not to most casual players. Also unlikely to recognize it if sandwiched in a sentence.. . "Waiting for something to happen?" on the other hand triggers those Omori neurons no matter the context of the phrase, even if the person wasn't making a reference 
figures, you must be a gross colour to say that

All of em hung on your wall each spelling omori? (Including kel drinking oj)
Not even rage just from the mixtape, rage from Kel waking him up with the mixtape 
IIRC it's rage because of the Mixtape which reminded Capt. Spaceboy of Sweetheart but i'd have to double-check. . &#x200B;. . yeah just checked and he's more pissed about the Music from the Mixtape than Kel playing the Mixtape. though the fact that it's Kel playing it ALSO Parallels how Kel tried to help Hero in the RW
I was trying to say Kel jumping on the bed and playing it to wake him up, like Kel waking Hero up lol. . [The dungeon and all]() are also seemingly related, or at least coincidentally
yeah i missed that from your comment sorry about that.. . But just that whole scene, if we replace the characters with RW Hero and Kel, and the Mixtape with Kel practically Begging for Hero to get back up and try living again, is heartbreaking. . [ this animatic is also just a super hard gut punch as well
Kel for Smash?
we could defend but we have more room now, we could make kel 
We need to make r/place cannon
We can make Kel 
"yup"
Try to add real world Kel, he is a god.
Definitely defending. I've been defending for hours now. WE ARE NOT GOING TO LET KEL DOWN. LET'S GOOOO
Kel’s the only one missing!
I’m not sure if anyone noticed but there at least was a Kel not too far off to the right
We need Kel there :((
Sans is a skeleton. Aubrey has a skeleton inside of her. Related

What happened to her?
was kel in the fic?
Well if he was then it would be canon

Burgers are what Kel constantly has on his mind. Kel and Aubrey are friends. Related
Mayonnaise is a lyric from the Kel Anthem “Burgers On My Mind.” Mayonnaise is mentioned during the chorus (“I wake up in the morning i got burgers on my mind, ketchup mustard mayo (short for mayonnaise) fries lettuce and number 9”).  This song is a Certified Kel Classic, and Kel and Aubrey are friends. Therefore, mayonnaise is related to Aubrey.
X'D gg
KEL.

Kel seems to be a friend to Aubrey. Related
I think all Kel memes are canon.
“I’m gonna fucking kill someone”. . Kel said calmly
Kel = Kris? No way man. Kel is a hyperactive sportsman who loves basketball. Kris is a gloomy prankster who manages to be only slightly creepy on a good day. They are night and day, other than both liking pranks, and even then Kel is a casual prankster (mostly against Aubrey) and grows out of it by the time of the OMORI events whilst Kris is an absolute gremlin.
FOR KEL AND COUNTRY!
Tbf, he's not too important in headspace and barely present in the real world. Aubrey has a lot of personality, kel is kel, and basil is a super important character to the story. I'm sad my boy gets left in the dust 
He plays fortnite with Kel
YES! Kel would totally force Hero to play Fortnite with him!
Hero would play it at first just because Kel wants him to but later on he becomes really good at it and carries Kel
Oh 100%!
"Look Kel! I'm cranking 90's! I'm cranking 90's Kel!"
He knows all of kels deepest secrets, but doesn't say anything cause he's not a snitch
Good ol' Brother-Brother confidentiality!
He accidentally taught Kel to swear. Like Kel heard him say bitch once and decided to use it in an argument
"Bitch!"
You just reminded me that no one in the real world swears (on screen), not even Hero and he's an adult. I'm surprised Aubrey didn't spew a bunch of fucks when arguing with Kel or something
counter: he knows pretty much every single swear there is but never uses them and in the 1 out of a million scenarios he does everyone gasps
he only says words like "frick" or "shoot" for Kel to not influence his little brother.
My headcannons are that both him and Kel are fluent in Spanish (I think it's pretty deductible that both him and Kel are of Latino origins) and that the halloween that he dressed as a super-hero is related to how he gained his nickname
he ends up being the shorter of him and kel by the time kel stops growing. . he and polly end up dating and getting married somewhere down the line. . despite this, he doesnt have a great relationship with basil and possibly never will, they were never very close in the first place. . he picks the tomatoes off of hero sandwiches. . he becomes a doctor, but hes more of a primary care doctor at a brand name doctors office rather than a specialist or surgeon of any kind. . the only kind of facial hair he can grow is a soul patch. . needs the room to be freezing cold when he sleeps so he can burrow under 10 quilts in any season
I remember I drew him in school once and the drawing made him look like Kel.
Chad like his younger brother, Kel
>Hero is a little more distant from the rest of the gang. He was mostly there to hang out with Mari, and he initially created the gang by allowing his brother to tag along and meet Mari's little brother, Sunny, because he thought they would get along.. . Yeah, that's the vibe I got from the photos. He's usually seen hanging out with Mari, so I could see the friend group arising because of that.. . >He has natural prowess in all tasks, but struggles to be a perfect brother to Kel. Occasional outbursts and arguments and fights with Kel happen, but they're mostly just emotional strains.. . Yeah, I could see that I suppose. The only issue with that is how Kel said he'd never seen Hero have an outburst towards him when he kept on pushing about Mari's death, though that could be interpreted as Kel referring to the magnitude of the outburst, its context, or his head just dismissing the other times as understanding that it was just Hero's emotions.. . >I would expect Hero to have some kind of shocked outburst from the truth. He tries to be a good person, and he knows Sunny's been through a lot, so he wouldn't lash out at him but it will probably be in a state shock, unable to process how to respond to this. It might draw him slightly closer to Aubrey and Kel since they would now share the trauma of being lied to in such a big way. He might eventually forgive Basil or Sunny if they stay in touch with Kel and Aubrey, but otherwise he'd won't take the initiative to tell them that.. . Yeah, that news would definitely be world-shattering for him. Though, as I've seen others say, his kinship with Sunny and fact that he went through a lot of the grieving process already would certainly help.
He was sickly as a child, which contributed to his parents favoritism and neglection of Kel. He also isn’t super athletic, something that Kel internally prides himself on, with it being the one thing he knows he’s better at than his perfect brother. Kel doesn’t realize this, and he tells himself that he doesn’t resent Hero or his parents, but leftover feelings are still there, buried deep down. . . On a happier note, I feel like Hero is the kind of person who laughs hysterically at really bad puns
He entered a basketball tournament with Kel despite not being the best at it just to make him happy
He knows damn well Kel is left behind all the time and just doesn’t know how to help
My fav boi is actually Kel, but Hero to me really is a people pleaser. His character parallels to Sunny are that both loved Mari, blamed themselves for her death, and spent a long time in self isolation until Kel got them both out, 3 years apart.. . Personally I believe that Hero would be in disbelief about the Truth, but eventually realize that he and Sunny both lost someone important that night, and that both Sunny and Basil had punished themselves enough. He also doesn't like the idea of "what if it happened to him and Kel".. . In the Five Stages of Grief Theory about Omori (which I don't believe), he usually represents Depression, however I'd say that he'd be Bargaining with how hard he works in college, and in doing favors for other people.. . I have a feeling he knows that he's the favorite child, considering on that night that he and Kel fight, he's the one to notice that Kel is crying and comforts him, not his parents.
I deleted my old account because Reddit decided to give an nft, so I said fuck that, and deleted my account.
Love this dude. Absolute number one. Anyways, my biggest headcanon is that when kel forces him to play fortnite or other games he plays on a shitty low fps laptop with horrid wifi and ping but just is happy to play with his brother while kel absolutely goes ape shit over the mic. Edit: oh and he’s hot. Important mention
 Kel, we need to cook Orange Joe. .  Yeah, bitch!
Do you enjoy having skin?
Kel you are not the batman 
omori kel from omori, kel kel from omori, aboobray kel from five night at kel, hero kel from omori, mari kel from omori, basil gay from omori
This canonical
This canonikel
yes
Better kel kel
I actually decided to mess around with the last names idea in my headcanon.. . Sunny & Mari Suzuki (both likely have Japanese roots). . Kel & Hero Granderson (seems like a name that fits them). . Aubrey Chase (just fits her really well). . Basil Magnolia (because of course he's named after plants)
Kel basketball
Sunny and Mari's last names are Suzuki, Kel [Kelsie] and Hero [Henry]'s are Rodriguez, Aubrey [Aubergine]'s is Williams and Basil's is Fey. Yes, this is all canon.
I prefer Hawthorne, but Fey's good too.
Kelsey and Henry Sanchez
KELSEY AND HENRY MONTOYA🗣️
Here are my headcanons (aside from Mari and Sunny, their last name can be found in the game files) (Kawahara) (I think it fits them LMAO). . . Kelsey (Kel) and Henry (Hero) Reyes. . . Aubrey Levine. . . Basil Van Dalen . . . That's it, lol

Kel
Kel is swag
Kel deserves more
Kel is one of the best "best friend" characters to ever exist.
Kel is awesome
Kel deserves a lil more support than anyone gave him. Sure he seems to be the most stable one to come out of what happened, but y'all could've given him some more hugs :(. . Also they all deserve so much therapy.
Kel memes are funny
I like kel
>!KEL is an amazing character.!<
Every Kel meme is canon
Kel is great
Kel is best boy. 
Kel
Kel is awesome and bestest boy
Kel’s a gross color
most likely just an error though
Most likely it was a reference to the people who helped make a lot of the OST, as a homage of some sort
kel get the banana
Does Kel truly have burgers on his mind?
Always brother… always
Is Kel God?

The tentacles are directly connected to "the wisest" Abbi, one of the 3 great creatures of the Headspace universe. She was likely banished to the Abyss due to telling Omori to confront his guilt. The others being "the favorite" Big Yellow Cat and "the oldest" Humprey. It's possible the weapons they contain are actually from previous iterations of headspace that Abbi had stockpiled or was stockpiling before her apparent banishing but I have no real evidence beyond why the weapons are locked with her.
Kel supremacy
Let's be real here.. Kel wins the whole thing.
if he doesn't, then i will commit orange joe like fanta in evangelion
PLEASEEE
KEL SWEEP 
Kel for then win! 
Yeah…
Kel most likely tbh

Kel will win.
IF KEL DOSENT WIN I WILL IMPLODE
I feel like Kel types like that
yeah
Kel will live forever
KEL SUPREMACY! 
GUYS WE HAVE TO KEEP KEL FOR THE END STAY STRONG
Kelp to the end
there's a good chance kel wins simply because haha funny but yeah agreed.
If Kel will won, it's not because he's haha funny, but simply because he's just a fucking good character.
KEL IS THE BESTESTWL
They got all the HS versions out first probably intentionally and I’m pissed they got HS Kel out so early so now I’m voting RW Kel because he’s overrated and I’m salty.. . I was really pissed about HS Mari getting out before RW because it literally makes NO SENSE BECAUSE RW MARI DOESNT EXIST.. . Anyway, vote Kel out to avenge little auby 
agreed >:v
I hope kel wins
I swear if Kel losses 
It's time to end Kel 

I'm sorry little one (kel)
Real life kel
KEL WINS KEL WINS KEEL SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP 
KEL SHALL BE THY NEXT.
Get Kel outta here
SAVE KEL
I want Kel gone
Rw kel don't ask me
Kel
Kel
Kel must be the winner, easily the purest one left
how did Kel survive lmao
I can say that Kel is my favorite of the main characters so that makes it 25% easier to decide
Kel.
This may sound MESSED UP but I loved how her suicide was executed in "Brokenspace" on AO3. It was so tragically written and an absolutely chilling read.. . Spoilers in case you want to read it yourself. . >!In the AU, Aubrey was the first of the gang to commit suicide after Sunny and Basil. She called Kel over the phone to an expressway where she literally stepped in front of a speeding truck in front of him lmao. They had to scrape off any scraps of her flesh on the road to put into her funeral, and of course she had to brutally go out in front of Kel's eyes. Talk about cruel.!<
>!did she specifically call kel there to traumatize or was it just in the moment...!<
>!I'm pretty sure she didn't want to die alone and that's why she called Kel over, but I'd like to believe she just wanted to give Kel the ride of his life lmao. It's probably in-character.!<
>!i guess it also could be if he wasn't it would be hard to identify her and people would think she ran away so maybe she also wanted people to have closure!<. . >!i can kinda see her doing that just to mess with kel one last time though!<
>!It literally says it was an obvious final cry for help.!<
i don't understand what you mean, but i have a difficult time understanding what people mean a lot so it's possible i could've missed it easily.
what
brokenspace is absolutely horrifying and i love it
kel got trolled huh
link?
imagine them at family reunions or college lmao they gotta tell their story about how 4 of their friend all killed themselves. . even worse imagine if only kel made it
jesus christ that’s fucking terrifying, being the only one out of your entire friend group to remain alive
I think she's the last of the group that would resort to that. I'd even argue that Kel would do that before her
She unironically says "based", "yas" and refers to people as "slick" in normal conversations. . She's also the most likely to survive a zombie apocalypse
She would be the next negan
She would be the next Reagan, Ronald or otherwise.
She literally has a nail bat straight out of a zombie movie, shes the most likely out of all of faraway town lol
I thought Kelbrey was called Baseball Bat?
First time I’ve seen it called that
I remember finding it on the Fandom website.
She likes burgers more that Kell. She likes fast food in general and probably has acne because of it
“Kel, you’re a gross color!” 
Due to her less than fortunate upbringing, she saves her money and urges her friends to do the same. Especially Kel.
Aubrey hates motorcycles and that is why she only uses a scooter. . . She is the poorest child in Faraway town and very insecure about it, which is why she insults everyone who is flaunting with their wealth, even when they didn't insult her directly at all. . . >!Aubrey hid from her friends the fact that she also bullies people aside from Basil like the priest and the young adult we see on the second day outside near the Othermarket. She did it out of shame. !<. . >!She commits suicide after the abandon ending, thinking that she made him kill herself.!<. . >!In the Hikikomori route, she undergoes every change she made in the normal route, but suffers the same fate as the ending with Basil dead.!<. . >!In the good ending, she isn't angry, as she has not the power to be angry anymore, because she was too angry for a long time and cannot hate Sunny and Basil for what they did as she did the same thing. She would still have a hard time accepting it, but will accept it.!<. . Bonus Nr.1: >!She really likes Sally and views her as a little sister, pestering Kel with her, but when she is disrespectful, she will punish her for this.!<. . Bonus Nr.2: >!Kel told her what happened to Hero after Mari died and how he yelled at him for trying to get him out. She is schoked as to how Hero can be this mean to his younger brother.. After this she apologizes to Kel for calling simple and that she had no idea what he had to go through. Kel apologizes for calling her worse than simple, she would then say that it was earned as she was an asshole. They get closer afterwards.!<
Kelbrey becomes a thing post true-ending.
Why is this being downvoted? I don't personally like Kelbrey, but from what I know it's not problematic in any way.
You choose who gets eliminated . If you vote Kel then you give him a vote for elimination
So basically Kel already won
I mean the people that voted for Hero will vote for the final two as well, theoretically they could vote Kel out
Kel smh needs to win. . 

lemon juice is pale beige, so are they beiges, or are they still named after the color lemon?

Um- no?  I’m sure any dad doesn’t even know what’s OMORI- 
Um- what i mean cringe is immoral, everything cringe is immoral
Because you literally said Kel he can do “69” with you, how can you even ask that? 
I’m just going to cry in the corner like bro- Kel, now you using the Mari omoji for a disgusting purpose, im done 😭
Aye bro I deleted them all all the comments are gone so more being mean to Kel
I’m not saying you have to be mean. I’m just saying that you shouldn’t have said that.. 
KEL!!!!
#KELSWEEP
the outcome wont be suprising, ive seen y'all simp for kel.
KEL!!
Kk (killKel)
There is only one winner. The Orange Joe addict himself. The Saviour, the burger lover. IT'S KEL!
KEL 
Kel
LETS GO KEL!!!
Kel
The fact that Kel has unironically managed to make it this far, is nothing short of impressive and absolutely hilarious. . . **Kel Supremacy!!!** 
very likely
Ayo is that Kel in the upper-left corner?
Does anybody have a photo of the kel one? I somehow missed it. Also babil looks so cute avuehrksiwhsksqo
Here you go! . . 
AAA HE LOOKS AMAZING 
Kel is the best!
WORSHIP THE KEL
Kelll
Super unbased٫ he's annoying and unfunny٫ just my opinion
maybe a bit in headspace but in the real world hes fine
Maybe it’s just the fanbase
Any threat to Kel team 6 must fall
Headspace Kel. He always annoyed me in a way RW Kel didn't
How dare you
Day 4 Of Voting For HS/RW Kel.. . Overrated Character.
Sorry, but I'm voting for kel honestly annoyed with the memes 
People really going to downvote somebody for how they choose to vote? I like Kel but he is an option for people to vote for. Just drink their tears if he gets eliminated.
headspace Kel i'm sorry 
Get that man kel out of there
Hs Kel. We can do without the 5000 damage.
Kel needs to stay!!! I vote space bf
Kick off the kels
Least favorite: dream world kel
Kel has to win
KEL WIN PLEADE
headspace kel's just stupid
Headspace Kel 🫣
More than understandable. When I first played the game I thought he was your typical sunshine and lollipops character, but then you learn the headspace characters are just his old friends as he remembers them certain aspects of his character come to light . . My theory is that because Basil likely grew up without friends until he met the others, and because his parents were never there etc...he overdid it with the kindness when he was with the friend group. He doesn't exactly exude confidence so he was likely just very agreeable all the time and always went out of his way to make it seem like he had no problems. He's quick to forgive Boss, he says it's ok when Kel and Aubrey knock him over etc... . . However there are small moments where Basil likely let his "nothing bothers me you guys are all so great" persona slip. He agrees with Aubrey that Kel is a bit of a prick, and tried to quickly move on when Kel and Aubrey begin to argue about the gladiolus. There is also his intentional phrasing of "that's how I WANT to be like" when describing how sunflowers always see the bright side, as if Basil let his sadness/anxkery/depression show on occasion  It's subtle but it's enough for Sunny to have registered Basil was capable of other feelings as well, despite trying to hide them.
Kel's death scene
kel is lucas (calendar art lemonade stand)
kel also has ness's shirt on in the... treehouse was it?
Yep!
that was part of the joke if matpat ever made an omori theory this would most likely be it
I'm pretty sure he knew full well that screaming at Kel would hurt his feelings.
KEL is the G
I am starting a hm group — no, REALITY. It will be called “EVERY KEL MEME IS CANON”.. . Goal: one of the kels wins Target(s): -Rw Aubrey -Rw basil (in honor of shark man). . Our motto shall be.. “I got burgers on my mind”. . We got this Kel lovers
KEL YES WHERE IS EVERYONE??
I find this acceptable if the fellowship of the Business Army Cats fails.
As a huge fan of both Kel and mewo, I feel conflicted. 
Im praying on DW kel's downfall
WHY????
hes horrible, i love rw kel but dw kel is just kind of an asshole way too often
Ah, that's actually quite fair, rw Kel is a lot kinder then dw, I get it 
Why is everyone against Kel??
Dw Kel
DW Kel
Sorry dw kel but leave plz
HS Kel.
Or Kel for that matter
DW Kel
RW Kel sweep
If Kel or Mar don't reach the finish, im going yo burn something 
HEADSPACE KEL
Real kel
Rude Buster Kel before he can pull it off. . . . . . . . . He's got to have atleast one turn before doing it to flex/get ecstatic to ensure the one shot. . . . . . . . Tho release energy could be an issue as that doesn't seem like something you'd be able to affectivly dodge
Have Aubrey use that one move where enemies target her, Kel can set up and end the Fun Gang's little tea party they call "an adventure", also Rude Buster requires TP and you can't get enough TP at the start of the battle to use Rude Buster, Kel would move first
also kel has a lil trick up his sleeve
And Susie is a fucking Dinosaur who's physically strong enough to wield a fucking battle axe and bite people's face off
youd need whatever it's called, TP I think it was?
It’s more like can they mercy before Kel nuke
kel solos
All fun and games until Kel flexes. Unrelated but Snow Grave vs Kel Nuke, now that's a real fight!
Yeah but can it >!kill a character that can normally only be pacified!<?
Onori, kel nuke go brrrr
Omori and Kris would each pull out the knives, resulting in a mutual KO.. . Hero and Ralsei would just be polite to each other, and avoid the conflict entirely.. . Leaving it down to Susie vs Kel and Aubrey. Kel looses.
There's no way around Coffee + Run N' Gun Kel.
depends on the context, if it happens in the dark world then omori and friends are gonna have a tough time, if it happens in HEADSPACE the fun gang would put up a good fight and could likely defeat KEL, AUBREY and HERO, but would run into a brick wall with OMORI, and prior knowledge/prep time is also important
Yes but Kris can also come back after dying, it's a race to make the other protagonist give up
You would be right if they were fighting casual enemies, but both parties are protagonists and most likely play by their own rules. We are just seeing the omori party's pov here.
Still, how would the Fun Gang dodge something like Release Energy or Run n' Gun, or, if in the Hikikomori route, Red Hands, Vertigo, Cripple, or Suffocate
All of the attacks you mentioned are portable to the dr battle system system though, I am just too lazy to explain the concepts through text. I can do if needed though
I think it would depend on which side the player is on. . If they are controling kris then the fun gang. . If they are controling Omori then Omori and friends. . But if i were to choose without taking into consideration player then i would probably choose omori and friends. . (i mean have you seen how much dmg can you set up with kel, flex, coffee run n' gun and the bunny ears ⁱ ᶠᵒʳᵍᵒᵗ ʰᵒʷ ᵗʰᵉʸ ᵃʳᵉ ᶜᵃˡˡᵉᵈ? Watch "kel is a freaking god" on merg's channel)
Just use Kel Nuke. Even the player that controls Kris will die.
hopefully a kel comes out cuz if it does im ordering right away
I have good news for you
wait did it come out
I thought Kel was a girl.
 (vineboom.sfx)

Same wtf
Same bro
Kel is orange Joe sexual
No, Kel! Not the fucking soda brand Kel!
🥤
Kel. No. Don't do anything you're going to regret.
*fucking the soda brand*
Why is the can hole very red?
Kel is sodasexual. . Hey!
Wrong, kel is the human equivalent of a golden retriever
Kel is aroace
Honestly I thought the same thing until I saw Headspace Kel talk about "getting all the ladies" at the Last Resort. Then again, that was an exaggerated version of his childhood self, so he very well could be aroace in the real world.
I think that was just part of a joke/roleplay
Not to mention Kel’s to big of a dunder head not to drop the ball if it was possible.
They most likely think its plausible because of enemies to lovers- since it is a common trope and all. 
Fuck that trope
I dont like it either lmfao
I could see it likely being a prequel
. . This is what it says when you put it in Google translate so it's gonna be adapting the same time as the game
she?
That would actually be fucking hype if true. I’d rather have a new story then just an adaptation.
hey look it's kel
All kel memes are canon..
Its kel's sister
Kel meme is canon in D
Transgender kel
Kels sister Sally in 20 years.
I’d say kel
I can't pull my eyes from Kel's hairy legs
Make your own kel nuke . . Buy coffee, antidepressants, and just flex your muscles
You get to stab yourself In front of kel 
I'm gonna be realistic here, I'd give Kel flex since that's the most impactful thing i can give him without breaking the game.. . Edit: I COMPLETELY misunderstood the question. I WANT PEP TALK!
And kel
Nah
Why not
Cuz. . . . . . . .

HAHAHA SAME NOW FIGHT ME 
Why don’t I see you?

Where are you?
Your DM's 
Um it hides in my accessories drawer
Headspace Kel. He's pretty annoying in a way RW Kel isn't
I will find you, and it's a 50/50 you'll live depending on the day 
Gonna have to vote headspace Kel, he didn’t do much
I'm sorry... kel...
Wow, and during pride month no less. Shame on you all. Let's vote kel.
Sorry DW Kel but you are annoying + you kicked flower boy flower hat
Ok boys I’m ready for the downvoting.. . Kel
after thinking about it im going with dream world kel just because he was kind of annoying at times i get that was the point but still
I'm voting out omor from dw Kel's picture
Dream Space Kel. Idk if i can choose past ds kel the rest are all of my favs
I tried to do this once, but i couldnt get my self to not open the door for Kel and do the Hikikomori route. I am weak
COME ONN, THE HIKIKOMORI ROUTE IS THE BEST
That's normal for all players who chose the good ending route first.
Around 5 or 6. First 3 were most likely just fun
"If I had a nickel for every time a boy with curly blonde hair took a photo of a corpse that was related with hanging, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened twice".
She is thundere most of time i think. Like,. She Saying didn't care her old friends but she actually cared them. or hating kel but actually love him.
Thundere:. . 
Lol
>!the impact that mari’s death had on kel and hero!<. . >!HERO: I feel like he’s perceived as the most one dimensional character and is honestly the least talked about in comparison to other characters. the element of hero’s grief is very critical to his character. he feels responsible for mari’s death and the guilt consumes him for that. he is more than just a character who is sad. he doesn’t want others to see the full aspect of his guilt and tries to be strong as he feels like he needs to look over the rest of the friend group. I feel like people miss out on key aspects of his character as they did not see the graveyard scene or remember the little bit of the piano scene at Sunny’s house!<. . >!KEL: I see so many people on tik tok especially talking about how kel wasn’t really impacted which is so silly. the impact on kel might’ve not been as severe as other characters but it is still there. additionally, kel is almost impacted through the impact Mari’s death had on hero. kel had to constantly watch his older brother struggle and be unable to cope with Mari’s death. kel also was outcasted in a way from the rest of his family and lost contact with some of his closest friends which must’ve had some impact on him. once again since people didn’t see the graveyard scene it causes people to not fully understand kel!<. . in conclusion the graveyard scene is such an important scene even though it’s optional.
People who think Kel is nothing more than a comedic relief character and that he's the only character who doesn't go through deep emotions.
kel being miss interpritated as just the "comic releif"  and not haveing any trauma (pls dont mind my spelling omg)
I collect all Infinity Stones and turn everything into Kel, yes even the Kelfinity Kelstones with my Kelfinity GauntKelet
You have summoned the kel lord *basketballs start raining* GET TO THE MINES!
You don't get the reference do you?

Its fine it was obscure anyway

Kelsey
I’m imagining Kel having to fight his version of OMORI in this universe and it’s just straight up Michael Jordan
We need Kel there
kel when no burburs
Kel would also change
oop I spammed mock, team spirit, kel pass to omori, cook, headbutt and used items when stuff got low. I'm good at making things harder than they need to be
Yes. The tail that makes Kel nuke hit super hard because it gives him a ridiculous amount of speed
Do not show weakness, obviously.. . But seriously, Rare Bear has special parameters that increase its overall stats if you let it stay angry, use sad attacks is preferable. You can easily kill them with Kel nuke if you have enough coffee.
make omori furious on the first turn using kel and items, have omori make the bear sad, you win. hopefully you have enough angering items
if you're high enough levels you can probably rotate using aubrey's counter, hero healing her EVERY round (as he will go *after* the bears usually) and using omori and kel as dps, kel for a heal if you're really screwed.. . I actually went there intentionally on my second and third playthroughs because it's a good source of xp, and relatively easy if you know how to do it. . . if you get low on juice you can run away from a bear, hold left, and this gives you as much time as you want to refill your juice on some of the crappy juice items you probably picked up tons of, since the other party members block the bear from getting to you.
I farmed the shit out of orange oasis until lvl 45 and went into the castle like a walking god dealing more than 100+ normal dmg without even using skills, if I did however it was overkill for one, so I used them as cleverly ad I could by using tea time and Kel's ability to get juice which was reducing a bit of hp every time
READY???. . . FIGHT!!!  (pro tip you can run away to use healing items between battles). . also, theres a Fox Tail in that room.  best thing in the game for Kel.
It's the final step in my becoming true Kel fan
the true final step is liking it
Yeah there's step i'm not going to cross
Canonically, Faraway Kel drinks Milk with his Orange Joe.. . And he hates milk 
I assume coffee means plain ol black coffee, no milk needed
What you gotta do is wing it, honestly. I don't think kel himself would measure it out, he'd just go for it, y'know? It's supposed to taste bad so what can you do
50/50 with a tiny bit of sugar, otherwise its bitter. Then put an, again tiny, amount of cinnamon and chill it. I think orange joe is really good honestly but it needs a little doctoring, which is probably way kel says the bottled stuff is good and that his own rendition isn't.
0% Coffee. 0% Orange Juice. 100% Kel
Ah yes my favorite beverage, kel
Yeah
*runs away from Kel*. . Nooo I don’t want to try a sip!
My friend said I am Kel and others said that it makes sense but I am NOT drinking that (don't look at the fact that I would 100% make that and take a chug)
People who say it taste bad did you try to use cappichino ? ( I discover Kel’s Orange Joe with this post )
Normal Orange Joe is better then Kel's homemade Orange Joe.
But Kel is there 😏
that is a great point
It’s probably also because of the extremely energetic and enthusiastic Kel (who may have had some strange ways of showing affection in his early years)
yeah true
I think it's because of the Kel sidehug. Who wouldn't get flustered?
ofc lmao
u know i always thought it was because kel was being annoying
lol, i just realised this is sarcasm and am feeling stupid
I think it’s just because Kel has his arm wrapped around her. I guess that’s a shipping thing for any of you shippers even though I’m not the biggest fan of that ship in particular
i mean im not rlly a shipper in general so i can understand that
Idk maybe kel is a bit too close to her
perhaps
are you meaning Kel,If yes i don't like this shipp
i mean i dont rlly ship characters, but i was just meaning in general of the people around her.
oh sorry,but sometimes shopping characters is a bad thing because of the shipp wars
yeah i suppose
Being hugged most likely. She looks the same way during the group hug at the end of the game, so we can assume she isn't really a fan of close contact.
*angsty teen phase, perhaps?*
this one is actually very likely
Kelbrey B)
i mean im not personally a shipper, but most ships arent that bad actually
Kel putting his arm around her, maybe?
maybe, but like i thought that would just make her angry, and i cant tell if shes flustered embarassed upset or crying.
>shes flustered embarassed. . Obviously, tsundere gotta tsundere or whatever weebshits call it
i think tsundere is kinds weird, not gonna lie but i dont rlly understand weebs and otakus. like i dont mean to offend anyone, and maybe the media has affected the way i see them, but it just feels like weird
It looks like she got scared because Kel wrapped his arm around her lol
*\*insert surprised pikachu face*
she is scared that there is no escape from kel
as well as the expired orange joe
Kel, my man. He looks so tall in this picture and i appreciate that.. . he looks like an epic giant
Kel is superior to normal humans
I said it before and i'll say it again, Kel's shirt in this image looks like it says "for fucks sake"
lmao
As in our system, we have a fictive of Aubrey (Me!) dating a fictive of Kel from another system, we have reasonable thought to believe i'm so flustered cause I like Kel
ok, but confusing comment
TL;DT We think of it as Kelbrey shipping. The reasoning might elude some people. . Sorry, let me try to clarify.. We're a system (if you dont know what that is, i dont blame you, its easier if you look up what DID is). And one of our alters is an introject of Aubrey from this game. . We know someone else who is also a system, and has an introject of Kel. . Our Aubrey and their Kel like eachother, so we just see this image in that way.
nice, ok. that is very interesting. a few months ago i was researching on DID and was wondering what it would be like to talk to a person who has it. this is very nice, i guess you learn something new every day
We were like that too until we found out we might have it. We dont claim it, because we're still looking for resources. But there's more ways to be a system than just DID anyway. Plurality (a more open concept to being multiple) has an interesting and welcoming community! Feel free to message us an time if youd like but no guarantees to a response.
ok thx
** crying in kel **
I thought it was impossuble to change their emotions. I just made kel ecstatic and used run and gun a lot.. . 
You can, but they'll change back. It uses up their attacking turn, however
did you have coffee
So you can reliably stall with kel feeding omori juice items and omori reading sad poems? Interesting.
Your best bet is probably kel nuke but it wont be nearly as effective without coffee
Nukel him
It’s winnable with the kel speed ball strat, just focus on single target damage with kel and aubrey, then replenish resources with all your other characters. Plus sometimes after a fight the bears get stuck so if you stand still you might have a chance to use items and such after a fight
Hehehe finally a new use for the Kel Nuke
Use skills or followups that modify the bear's emotions. For example: Omori's sad poem and painful truth skills and trip followup, and Kel's curveball. Hopefully you also have books, dandelions and sparklers to change the bear's emotions too. Also, if you time it just right, you can pause the game and heal/change skills before each fight.
suffer         .       . just use mock, smile, and team spirit.  Use Kel to heal (Flex+Run N’ Gun is also good if you don’t need heals/juice).  Giving the daisy to a party member that you usually don’t target with team spirit lets them take less damage from the bear too.  I also recommend killing King Carnivore beforehand for levels if you didn’t drop the anvil on him.       .       . They aren’t really amazing for XP, but the items they guard are good and it’s a fun challenge.
by the time this happens in the game it is very likely it has happened before.
cause it's not real, the physicality you will feel from real or imaginary things are significantly different. You can always predict things that are fake but the real condition are much harder and less likely is the case.
KEL HATES SPEZ. . KEL HATES SPEZ. . KEL HATES SPEZ
Having fuck spez in there both helps send the message to reddit, and more than likely get us left alone, anything relating to fuck spez has huge community support
True if it wasn't there idk how long we will last
I don’t like bad words though 😿. . Spez = Poopy would be funnier and get the same message across.
Hang on guys we've got to change all of reddits opinion because someone doesn't like a word
Not what I said.
Fuck
😈. . ^ you while typing that 😹
No I was 😐
My apologies.
Dude...seriously? Are you even old enough to be here? You're gonna be seeing a lot of swear words in your life and especially on the internet like you pretty much can't avoid it cause it's perfectly normal so, too bad lmfao
You are unusually bothered by a poopy joke. Calm down.
Oh, fuckshit, bitch, damn cocksucker. Pussy, asshole, cunt. . Mother fuckin' dirty whore, shat onto my lunch. Pisscunt, damn bitch, suck my dick. . Jesus Harold Christ. . Shit bitch, cocksucker, Goddamn motherfucker, pussy, asshole cunt
Eddie Murphy made a joke like that in Delirious after Bill Cosby chastised him for swearing haha. Was hilarious.. . (They didn’t get the reaction they wanted so they downvoted, fuming irrational anger at its finest 😹)
this is something that Kel would say
Doesn't fit, she has to share the house with Kel 
Buuut she gets to punch him every day 
RIP Kel xd
i beat kel
kel is a cat
in your future you get therapy and have a loving family, also kel no lounger annoys you
Kel has been wiped off the face off the Earth due to you tagging him :)
Fine, I'll let you punch kel in the face
Kel just died
I always thought it'd make more sense if you played as Kel for these scenes. It doesn't make a ton of sense for someone who spent so long in his house to suddenly get a part-time job.
My head canon is that he has a tape recording of Kel screaming it that he plays.
wrong, he's fighting for his life on pictochat while kel spams scribbles
So bad Kel just swapped genders.
From a bro to an Tomboy because of that? okay that sounds weird
 what. I d-. .  shut up kel nobody asked.

Yo, estrogen Kel? 
You mean Kelsey?
Kel's original name was already Kelsey, female Kel would still just be Kel lol
Or just a nickname by the initials of that name... so yeah the full name is Kelsey
Kel does what kel wants
At the mirror to see Kel turned into misaka mikoto overnight.
Seeing how white Kel is like who tf is that that is not Kel bring back his melanin holy hell

kel looks like his counter part kelsey to me because of the eyelashes
Hey is true
Why dose Kel look like they have Ta ta's (if you know what I mean)
That... is a good question, maybe it's Kelsey (the female version of Kel)
Ok, im new to Omori
why does kel look like a waifu
I don't know, maybe he looks a bit girly in this
Why do Kelsey Grammer the third look like a gril
why is kel a woman.
He aint
Kel looking like a chick
white kell
You mean, Kel White (breaking bad)
Kel is Sus
All the time
more importantly, am i crazy or does kel have tits?
Kel boy
kel because he looks like he's about to eat a quarter
I think he's already eaten a quarter, and is going back for more because he thought it tasted good
This made me love kel even more, holy fucking shit I’m always finding new reasons to love kel
There are infinite reasons to love KEL.
Now I want more
I dont know if this is a compliment or a r/rareinsults
You can shooting a coin a martial art?
Bro how did you sum up how he looks so accurately?
Thought it was Kel for a moment.. Yeah, it's cute. But I think my favorite is Omori. There's just something funny about his dead serious facial expression on a plushie.
Then why is kel in the front?
Because Kel bodies all.
Then why is kel in the front?
Kel (he’s a silly little guy)
im asking mostly bc i made a kel plush fanart a few days ago and i can’t decide who should be next
KEL! 
Kel cause he's just a little guy. Look at him! Just a little fella:)
Kel: he’s just so AWESOME looking, I love his smile and his shirt. He’s very well designed
Obviously, Kel, cause he's Kel. And also because he was laying on so many Hectors in his cover image for the plush.
u a real one
Kel is my favorite because he’s already set fire to my house twice
Kel plush. Not a single thought behind those eyes
Tie between Basil and Kel. Basil because his face is so damn funny to me, and Kel because Kel.                                                                                                                           Edit: also Aubrey because I cannot stop thinking about "it's time to drink water."
Kel's
Omori for sure, character wise too (Kel is a close second)
KEL. Hes not my fav character or anything but the kel plushes smile is so goofy i love him 
Omori and kel, Anything else is heresy
Kel
Kel and that goofy ahh smile
Kel because kel
Kel JAJAJA. When I bought mine I was between Buying Kel or Mari, i ended up buying Mari but I hope I can buy Kel too
Maybe also Kel
Kel because you can throw him at a ceiling fan
kel bc he looks like he has bitten the corner of a desk and liked it
Kel cuz he’s just super goofy looking
probably kel because he looks insane, hes looks like the kid that took a chomp out of the dodge-balls in school.
For Kel
I love him but I love Kel more so…
Kel was fucked over by this game, man.
TRUE!! I love him so much. We need more genuine Kel appreciation.
Like, please let this man cry. Atleast once. You are in he needs it.
Exactly- my poor guy has been through just as much as the others, yet he still keeps an upbeat and positive attitude. He tries so hard and we love him for being so kind! 
Exactly, it feels like Kel is treated as if he isn't just as traumatized as the rest of the gang. Everyone experienced the same dead body of a loved one hanging from a tree, yet it feels like everybody else just pretends like Kel didn't go through that with him. The plot reads like the characters never acknowledged Kel's feelings, which seems mostly true, with the only good look into Kel's mental health being when you're at Mari's grave. The one place he probably finds it hardest to mask his emotions. I wish Kel had the loved he deserved.
Same. We love Kel, and cherish Kel in this household.
I even changed my PFP to honor this guy even more.
I used to get caught in spells were my thoughts were filled with him, and he was the only thing that I could draw. My home wallpaper is of this man, I adore that traumatized little man.
HELL YEAH MAN!
at this point, I just draw almost nothing but Kel. He is a literal king to be able to focus and prioritize the others and hes so proud of his brother. All he focused on was "my brother was sad and I want him to feel better" and did that for the rest of the gang. He just wants everyone to be happy.
Kel 👍

i really like kel 
KEL.
I dont trust ppl who dont like kel. How can anyone not like kel!? /hj
Headspace Kel is annoying tho but i like Real World Kel he is a absolute chad
Happy cake day :)

Kel's stone
His name is hector
kel bcs he reminds me of me before i became miserable and lost my personality x. . edit: we both also have a perfect older sibling 
kel in every way shape and form
kel. . probably
Kel
It has to be kel
Kel
It's real world Kel 
Kel
Kel is the only correct answer
That’s Kel
**KEL.**
***K  E  L .***
Kel is goku 
No, goku is kel
Better
Total kel move right there
That's honestly the most likely reason, probably a bit of her dress got caught on a branch.
Kel put glue traps 
: I am going to kill you Kel. . : ok. . : OMORI!
Kel's friend you meet at the park, Jay, is actually supposed to be the Jock from the Pretty Boy comic as well 
WAIT I THINK THEY HAVE DIALOGE TOGETHER!!!
Yeah they do at the end of three days left iirc
To be fair, it was their first attempt and a kickstarter backed game. Through Omori’s release they now have popularity, experience, and likely proper funding if they wanted to do another.. . I don’t think it’s likely tho
>They now have popularity, experience and proper funding. . And the fact that they already delivered the game. A lot of people thought Omori was a scam because there was no history of the team actually making a game, but with Omori comes the realization that they sure fucking can make a good game lol. . Though that last part also brings a lot of expactations...
>!no its never truly confirmed, and I dont really think its all that likely for his mother. His father is implied to have at least had suspicions though, so maybe it’s possible that she had suspicions too!<
>!If nothing else, I think the Black Space scene with his dad at least makes it more likely that his mom knew too. It would be kind of strange if that scene occurred in reality with no communication about it between the two.!<. . >!(Or maybe they were just suspicious, and his dad leaned more towards it being the truth... who knows, really! His mom might even know, but simply be in denial about it.)!<
>!That's a valid possibility. There are some parts of Black Space that seem to be at least heavily inspired by real memories, but often still with some distortions-- and some parts are just complete subconscious nonsense. So it's anyone's guess on that, really... I guess I should have clarified that my previous comment was only referring to if that scene was an entirely real memory.!<. . >!As for your sibling's question... well, I'm only familiar with US laws, but some states are required to perform autopsies only for certain circumstances, such as if substance abuse is suspected. Other states only require them if a homicide is suspected, and some perform them routinely unless the family expresses wishes against it (or certain circumstances are involved).!<. . >!I think the most likely possibilities are: either his parent(s) knew & kept quiet about it to protect him; or they may have suspected it, but not strongly enough/still didn't want to pursue investigating it for whatever reason; or they had no idea what really happened... and in that case, why would they want an autopsy if they believed it was a suicide? Just to confirm the reason for their grief, but also prolong it? I think all three of those options are feasible, but none point to a reason why the parents would want to have one performed (if their location deferred to their wishes).!<. . Also... I see what you did there!! 
>Also... I see what you did there!! . . . . Though thanks for the response Im not really well informed about how autopsies work. 
It's not an oversight, we're told that only the lights will go out and only the lights went out. I'm not sure why it needs to be satisfying, but even if it is unsatisfying then it's certainly a better solution than compromising the veracity of the entire story. . edit: ok well it possibly is an oversight, but I'd say that the appliances still working after that night is more likely to be the oversight, not the microwave. He could've just used the microwave before the power cut out
Ah I see. My bad. I just assumed it was likely but we all make mistakes I suppose
I think Kel is a complex person, like any of us. I think the little details we get about him post “incident” can help us understand the person Kel is.. . Kel tells Sunny that after >!Mari’s death!< he was confused and afraid of making things worse. He goes out of his way to stay away from his friend group since he knows he’s not good in emotionally intense situations.. . Thankfully, unlike Sunny and Hero, Kel decided to cope with >!Mari’s death!< by focusing on sports and making friends. These are much healthier way’s of coping, rather than not leaving the house, joining a gang, or…being Basil in general.. . One thing I’d like to point out is that Kel DID care about >!Mari!<. Other than saying he thought about her every day, when Kel is trying to break through to both Hero and Aubrey, he ask them what >!Mari!< would do, how >!Mari!< would feel about them. This isn’t Kel trying to emotionally manipulate their friends, in my opinion Kel use’s the memory of Mari as his moral compass.. . Even thought both Hero and Aubrey proceeded to lash out at Kel, Hero quickly apologizes, preventing Kel from having a strained relationship with his brother.. . Kel does seem to be neglected emotionally to some extent. During his fight with Hero, his parents didn’t try to comfort him at all. Kel seems to not hold any ill-will, but even then no one else seems to take Kel’s emotion’s very seriously.. . Kel is amazingly optimistic. Once he learns Sunny is moving he tries for months to arrange a meeting between the two. Even after he loses hope that Sunny will come out, he goes to his house and bangs on the door non-stop, because he’s that loyal to his friends.. . Kel seems much happier than everyone else because he simply is. He’s just a Chad like that 
Yeah he really did ask Sunny what would I do in that situation (Mari written as Mark typo).\. But in all seriousness, I think you're actually right. That art of present Kel make past Kel smile using his fingers to hold it makes me think that he kinda faked his well-being at the start, but eventually started to deal with the incident in a healthy way and actually overcame the situation quite well.
Holy shit my favourite omori character mark can I have your autograph
Another thing about Kel that I never see talked about is that he said he was going to give up on Aubrey after the two days left thing, and Hero had to convince him to forgive her. Makes it harder to predict what he would do after the true end IMO
Personally I think Kel would still forgive. The main lesson that Kel learns during the story is…. . “Friend’s…friends are supposed to be there for each other.”. . I don’t think Kel would react with anger, like Aubrey and possibly Hero would. I imagine he would be stunned, but also understanding that it was an accident. Although I can imagine things be complicated if Kel wants to forgive Sunny but Hero doesn’t.
My reading on Kel is that he's slower to anger than Aubrey, but also stays angry for longer. The biggest evidence to me is that after the two days left incident, Aubrey seemingly tries to defend herself and maybe even apologize, and Kel just doesn't let her talk. Bear in mind that this is right after Kel made a bad situation significantly worse by >!getting into a fight with Aubrey instead of helping the drowning person ten feet away.!<. . I personally think that Kel's response isn't as clear-cut as a lot of people think it is.
Kel is such a loveable character but man, several times in the story I wanted to tell him to just shut the fuck up.
Kel > Sunny. Kel is love, Kel is life. If there's just one Kel fan in this world, be sure it's me. If there's no Kel fans left, then I'm no longer in this world. Kel's not a character, rather a way to live your life, a beautiful one. I've been praying to the Orange Joe God every morning and my life has just improved ever since. Kel can turn anyone's life from misery to heaven by just giving them a burguer and some orange joe. Universally loved Sunny may have speedrunned every job in existence and made friends with the whole town, but Kel's got something he doesn't: burgers on his mind. Plus his big bro is the owner of the Outback Steakhouse restaurants, and that's always a plus. Live long, live Kel 
Based copypasta 
Not even a copypasta hahshahaha, hoping to start the Orange Joe God cult soon enough  That could actually make a decent copypasta tho... Good idea 
I'm already in 
First we had Hero's owning Outhouse Steakhouse, now we need the Kelp to rent some old place and recruit people to praise with him to Dear Orange Joe. The cult must start soon 
GASP . . . . . …can I join the Orange Joe God Cult please
The Orange Joe Cult always has his doors open for any new member that wants to join, my fellow Orange Joer 
YAYYY :D
Common Kel enjoyer W
Common Kel enjoyer enjoyer mega W 
I'M IN 
Based and Kel fan! 
TL;DR, Kel's a giga chad and the world is better with him in it
True, he's the ultimate no simp sigma who just cares about sports and chilling around. Couldn't desire anything better tbh.
Bars 🔥
super well written op! he’s one of my fav characters of all time and this was a perfect explanation :))
Seriously! I remember opening the door to him during my first playthrough and being relieved that the scary phobia stuff was over. Then I was amazed, over and over again, with how much more mature Kel is than DW Kel. The dude is impossible not to love.. . Duck it, just to list a few of my favorite moments!. . -Kel making an attempt to get Sunny out of the house for month’s . . -Kel scolding Sunny for having a knife. . -Kel attempts to talk down all the hooligans before fighting them.. . -Kel tell’s Sunny they should respect the sermon and wait to confront Aubrey until it’s over. . -High five’s . . -Relentless in trying to return the photo album . . -Once he hear’s Aubrey’s side of the story he apologizes for past mistakes.. . -Doesn’t judge Polly for her cooking choice’s.. . What a chad.
LOVE U FOR THIS
Kel really is best boy <3
I wish awards were still here
Fr 
god man he is so me </3
Can you remind me in like two days to read this because I wanna but can't read that much right now...?
Reminding you now
Nice explanation but it looks like at first you were trying not to spoil anything but at the end you just left it like that
Sorry about that! I think I fixed it!
Kel is Smart. . Be like Kel
>!It might have to do with when you visit ‘Mari’ and Kel suddenly goes from cheerful and a bit dumb to more down to earth that this headcanon stems from, since personally for me this was quite a change in personality from what we had previously seen!<. . I personally think that at least 50% of that joy is geniune
It’d be weird if he’d still be cheerful at that moment though
>!so RAD that your sister died dude! let's take some pics to remember this moment!!!<
the character was not cheerful in a sad moment -> he must've faked 50% of his happiness. stop reaching lmao
C'mon man, the commenter was just giving his own opinion (and he even states it as so by calling it a headcanon). You don't have to be a dick to him about it by calling it reaching.. . >!There's nothing wrong with interpreting the grave scene as Kel maybe have having deeper emotions that he just isn't willing to show at all times in front of others. Omocat also had an official artwork piece a while ago where she had an older Kel putting a smile purposefully on a younger Kel's face during his birthday. This could also hint that maybe Kel's smile is sometimes a facade. It's just an interpretation.!<. . A link to the art piece: [here]()
it's really not that serious. check my other comment here if you want my honest opinion on the matter.
I don't have a problem at all if you have a different opinion or disagree with the commentor above (it's perfectly ok and valid if you have a different opinion!). And seeing your other comments, your rationale is completely sound as well. It's just that it's nice to be respectful to the other person while stating disagreement.. . Saying that he/she's "reaching" as you did in your original comment is kind of a dick thing to say, especially because the person was also just stating their own opinion and not claiming to have "facts" about anything. You can disagree with them while being respectful.. .  It's just nice to be respectful to each other in these online discussions, especially when it's hard to interpret the tone behind other comments which can lead to misinterpretations and hurt feelings. In this way, more people are encouraged to share their own thoughts!
I respectfully disagree 😎👍
emoji users are the most oppressed race 😭
lmfao I don't think it's got anything to do with emojis but that's funny
it's a joke. I'm sure u/X-Beau-X is fine. sure respect is important but so is humor, and a comment having a slight edge for that sake should not offend you. if it does you should reevalute how much power you want to give other people over your life.
50% of the expressiveness, more like. Obviously though not 50% of the time.. . But like he definitely intentionally expresses his happiness more than other emotions, but that's not a bad thing or anything, it just means that he's focusing on and trying to be happy.
I think it's more of a headcanon thing. But to me, it does seem like he'd try to put on the biggest smile on his face just for the sake of making his friends happy. His friend's happiness is his happiness too
yes
It’s less that he’s not happy and more if he throws away his grief and doesn’t deal with it and instead indulges in his happiness. Thats what gives him the “everything’s fine” vibes
Realistically, it’s a bit of both. The emotion chart was clever and all, but none of them were entirely one thing. I think that there’s an argument to make that of Hero, Aubrey, and Kel, Kel is the most complex in how he handled his grief after the “incident”. . . Obviously, we don’t know much about the time after >! Mari’s death !<, at least until the events of the game, so it’s tough to piece it all together. At first glance, it looks like Kel is the spitting image of >! his Headspace counterpart !<, full of energy and simply happy. . . While the theory of his positivity being faked is largely a headcanon, there is a fair amount of evidence to support it. During the first optional scene at >! Mari’s grave !< he talks about how he “blocked out a lot of it”, referring to >! Hero’s breakdown !<, because it was more important to be there for his sake. . . I think a lot of people confuse his lack of understanding in certain situations with simplicity and denseness. In reality, he’s the most determined character in the game. I don’t doubt that a majority of the time, he really was happy - when everyone else went their own way, he stayed the most consistent to his younger self. . . It really comes down to your interpretation of a few scenes and dialogue snippets. Whether he truly had found peace and stayed happy or was simply putting on a brave face is unknowable - but there’s evidence to support either interpretation.
more headcannon territory. he is genuinely sad about the accident but I think he realized that it’s not worth it- dwelling in the past would be no good for him.. . people forget that even if a character is vibing all the time all the time that doesn’t mean that they fake it, they just learn to live with life. and characters like that do have other emotions (sad, anger, fear etc..) happiness is just their prominent feature so people twist it into their only thing and put a reason behind it.
[Official Omori art, notice the tear on young kel](). We can add the emotion chart theory to this, so it is heavily implied he used to, but it's uncertain if he still does that
Thought that tear was a sweat drop tbh
To my it looks like it comes out of his eye, but a sweat drop and well, the fact that older kel literally is forcing young kel to smile also implies that the smile used to be forced
Kel went through a lot of shit and probably hasn't recovered from most of it. Not only the "incident", just also the other "incident" with Hero and his parents neglecting and ignoring him just to give all of their attention to their favorite son, plus the fact he probably doesn't get much neither in the modern days of the game due to Hero's university career and his parents having to take care of Sally. Maybe he didn't have a home situation as bad as Aubrey, but he probably had the second worst one (at least before the "incident". I mean, Sunny's family was happy, and Basil may not have parents but had Polly and his grandma. Most of the time Kel was all by himself and that's probably why he was so energetic with his friends, because they were the closest ones to him. This more than a headcanon feels like interpretation). . People tend to misunderstand Kel's character a lot, saying he's just a "dumb kid who can't read the elephant in the room" or stuff like that, while in reality I think that it's in fact canon that he smiled through pain just to try and make everyone he could feel better. This is clearly noticeable if you read his dialogue in RW (and don't skip them thinking they are boring or just jokes). Stuff like he saying he blocked out most of the second incident, that he didn't blame Hero for what he did to him, he neither cared of his parents ignoring him because he knew Hero needed the attention. Kel's just a wholesome guy with a golden heart, even in Day 3 he tries to make everyone feel happy with goofy acts like drinking the expired soda (something Kel would never do alone for example). . If anyone's really interested in a character analysis of him, there's a fantastic video on YouTube that explains everything on detail, something like "Kel, the kid who smiled through pain" or Kel, the kid afraid to make things worse", some name like that. I'll try to leave a link if anyone requests it! 
Please post the analysis. Kel is one of my favorite characters in the game and honestly one of my favorite fictional characters in general. I always knew that he was processing it his own way but that doesn't mean that he was more or less affected by the incident. His feelings are equally valid. I'm just sad that the meme version has kinda overtaken what is a very complex character. I always saw him as a people pleaser who lives vicariously through others and I know people who are like this.
Just got out of work, but here they are!. . Here's the one I watched most recently, a really good one too : [. . I also recommend this one, I don't remember all of the vid but the red bar was full, so it must be good! [. . Not watched this one full yet, but it seems good from what I've seen: [. . Another great one I haven't had time to watch just yet, but seems good too! [. . Overall, most of Kel's analysis are really good. I kinda hate how the fandom tends to only represent him as a dumb kid who laughs a lot. I really like jokes like "burguers on my mind" and stuff like that but i feel people tend to ignore Kel without taking the proper time to understand his character truly. In my opinion, he's more underrated than Hero in the fandom, and even more in the game lol. Kel just needs a big ol' hug from Aubrey, Sunny and the whole gang 
Sure, let me try to find them! There's a couple of analysis actually, I'll try to paste the links here, gimme a minute 
I can see it. I do think he's happy more than not though
It's more of a headcanon thing, but there's some precedence for it. I think the fandom overdoes it though. . . It's clear to me that he's dealt with it in a somewhat healthier way compared to others, but it's possible that he also doesn't allow himself to process that grief too much for the sake of others. He did mention that >!he was afraid of making things worse, likely after Hero's outburst towards him.!< Still, he's a pretty well adjusted kid in comparison to everyone else, but it's clear he's hiding from it to an extent. I don't think it's enough to claim that he's secretly depressed. It could be the case, but the game never gave that much information.
I see people say “ kel is really sad he fakes a smile” is that actually true? I don’t remember that at ALL in the game

There is a canon art where older Kel is holding younger Kel's face in a smile around his friends, hope this helped
hes just a silly little goofball
Kel is just a normal dude who went through the 5 stages at a normal pace and understands that Mari would want him to be happy
This is kind of the simplest explanation but I think that's the point. Some people who go through a specific trauma are able to cope with it more quickly than others and are able to move on more completely without appearing to be as affected by it on the outside. That doesn't mean they're lying about their emotions, or that they didn't go through their own internal struggles. . . Not to mention, while Kel was close to Mari as a member of the friend group, he of course wasn't as close as Hero was, and he isn't burdened like Sunny and Basil with the full truth of what happened. He also has a healthier support structure than Aubrey. It makes sense that of everyone else involved, Kel was able to move on after a few years in a relatively healthy way.
omori fans when mfs are happy
It is canon in a way, but not everything is true… When he was little he probably did it a lot less but he seal with the problem of feeling lesser than Hero and unappreciated by his parents. After Mari passed away things became more difficult. He didn’t understand how someone could just leave the world like that, but he tried to move on, leading to people thinking he didn’t care that she died. He just didn’t want to show that he was vulnerable, unlike Hero. And the night Hero snapped, Kel probably just decided that he would be the person to bring light into other’s lives, and not care about his own feelings or well being. Opening up to Sunny in the graveyard was important because Kel hadn’t told anyone what happened prior. He felt comfortable with telling Sunny how he felt. It’s said that despite not talking often, Sunny was a good listener and people like Basil could talk to him about things. Kel opening up about his troubles is incredibly important and shows how much he truly went through in the four years since Mari’s death. It seemed like he was okay, but he was just a people pleaser making his way through life without caring for himself because he felt he wasn’t important enough, considering how he is obviously treated lesser than Hero is by their family, and played off being stupid and cheerful to make people not worry about him. Kel isn’t stupid. Yes, he was very immature as a child, but due to the stress in his life as he got older, he matured, but tried to maintain a facade that he was still like he was as a kid. Of course he can be air headed at times, but he definitely isnt stupid. Ffs he convinced Sunny to leave his house after years of trying to see him again just so he could see if Sunny was okay. He is selfless. That is his flaw. And a lot of us are like Kel and don’t realize it. When people joke about Kel being an idiot and not taking him seriously when if you look deeper you can see he is more complex, if not the most complex character in the game somehow. He’s not just an orange joe obsessed memelord like the fandom makes him out to be. He’s just a boy that wants his loved ones to he happy, but suffers in the process due to his selfless behavior. This is why Kel is my favorite character. He has such a deep and relatable character yet everyone overlooks it for the sake of making jokes about him. It upsets me. But yeah. Thats my thoughts on this.
THIS!   . and also u mentioned the fandom. to me, i think people just try to cope with this sad game better by making jokes about it. it can be funny, but as u said, that leads to a lot of people overlooking him and the depth of his character
A lot of the older fans from 2014-2021 or so value his character from what ive seen. Most of them have been through a lot based on the people i've met. But after the console versions came out the game blew up and random people started playing it and overlooked the narrative of the game itself. It's fine to joke about these things, I joke about the >!suicide endings!< as a way to cope with my own >!suicidal ideations!< often, but some people ONLY joke about it. Like haha>! Mari fell down the stairs!<, every Kel meme is canon, omg lets sing my time, lets beat up Basil because he sucks...  . . . this fandom is just... interesting to say the least.
>!Kinda? His birthday art really says about that.!<
I never saw any sign he's faking being happy
Well, it’s not like he’s ALWAYS happy about everything. I see Kel as just very optimistic when he can be; he takes in joy whenever given the chance. I don’t see many reasons why he would be faking. . . >!He did say he blocked out Hero yelling at him, which isn’t healthy per se; but I can see some people misinterpreting that for fake happy. !<
I don’t think it’s fake. It’s more like it happened and he had the time of grief but he excepted it and moved on with life he still cares but with acceptance.
He might've done it at some point but the Kel we see in the game looks genuinely happy and well adjusted to me.. . Kel wears his emotions on his sleeves and has no need to hide anything. Despite being happy most of the game, we've also seen him openly sad and angry at certain points — like when he confided to Sunny about what happened to Hero and how he reacts whenever Aubrey and her friends treated Basil horribly.
Hope so, i wouldn't can live knowing he's depressed in the entire game 
I think Kel was the only one who tried to move on from the incident in a healthy way. He didn't shut everyone off, stop enjoying his hobbies, or join a gang. I believe he was the happiest one.
kel is the light. kel is only there to be happy or he ends up fading away into dust.
I would say Kel is that kinda ppl who deal more easily some situation than others ppl, that's why he always look so happy or cheerful, bc he is happy and cheerful, and yeah, he can feel down, but he could never feel so down to the point of depression like regular ppl  . at least that why i believe
yes, and everyone can perceive and understand some things differently and thats why everyones experience with playing this game is differnet and unique. i love that.
Am always Happi
nah brother is doing just fine
He just happi bro wth
Probably fakes it
I think he's genuinely happy most of the time but I bet there are times where he's genuinely sad at something but he keeps a facade of happiness up
I think he forces himself to be happy but not actually faking it
He doesn't
I personally headcanon it, buts that’s mostly because it’s my favorite character trope and I’ll be damned if I don’t write angst about my favorite characters
id have to go with headcannon, theres nothing that explicitly states he is faking being joyful though depending on your interpretation of some of the headspace stuff you could string together a decent amount of evidence that points towards that
Kel is Kel. Kel found salvation in the sport after incident
I don't think he has enough brain cells to be sad
I believe he's more like trying to remain happy despite everything, he's accepted what happened and kept moving on (after all, he is meant to represent acceptance). So yeah, he's not faking his happiness, he's just trying to remain happy.
I think that's just him. I used to be like that when I was a child that age.
My stoic boy Kel
I think he might still be happy, but he does have some hidden problems.
he keeps a smile, to give others a smile, witch gives him a real smile
he is happy and he does enjoy his "everyday life" lets say, but he definitely has some problems he goes through in his head (we all do). but i think that when he feels down, he doesnt like to show it beacuse that way, he would be passing negative energy on others. so sometimes he tries to conceal his sadness with this...and that is not a really good way to cope with things. from that we can see that he doesnt like to open up to others so easily - he likes to deal with his problems on his own.
And we are not the only ones hahaha. . I've met another guy with the same profile picture, answered to a couple of his comments in some posts, plus i think there's even ANOTHER one apart from us 3. . We are the 4 Horsemen of Kelpocalypse 
More like the Apokelypse
Dang that's even better 
Have you seen Aubreys house lol? Its surprising their fathers didnt name her "Bunch of garbage that only eats and poops". Poor Aubergine   . . . And for Kel... Why in the hell they name his brother Henry, his sister Sally and then name him Kelsey? For christs sake, someone hug these poor kids 
 Kelsey's roadhouse. . Also I'm surprised Aubrey's parents didn't go "that's too hard to spell just name her ava"
Fr fr, poor Aubergine should have been adopted by Kelsey's and Henry's family, or at least by Basil's or Sunny's (although those aren't happy families )
Kel has the only stable household fr
Fr man, and even though he has, poor Kelsey goes through a lot of shit (pretty much his parents ignore him and just care about Hero ). . \-> Needs some love and his parents to stop neglecting him
Fr when I was talking to kel at the cemetery I cried. He's a silly little guy who needs love too
For real man, people tend to misunderstand the poor guy. . He's not just a "dense but funny" guy, he's a complex character and the best friend someone could have, I mean: He managed to get Sunny out of his house, protected Basil after years of not talking, tried to fill in Mari's role, forgave Hero for what he did to him plus never mocks him about the spiders even if he mocks Kel about his grades, and in my opinion what gives away how good a friend he is: He gained Aubrey's trust.. . Aubrey comes from a broken house, and while she may be good friends with Sunny, Basil, Hero and Mari her relationship with Kel is really special. While everyone else always treats her carefully, he treats her normally (kind of like those friends blind people have, for example, those that don't even give attention about their friend being blind but rather the kind of person he is). Kel also does so with Sunny in real world, treating him normally instead of being careful with his words, and I think this is why both Aubrey and Sunny liked him so much, he's always sincere and honest. . I could literally go on for hours about how good hearted Kel is and how people misunderstand him, but i feel there's plenty of videos out there that explain his character perfectly. . Kel is love, Kel is life. Live long, live Kel 
He's literally the friend who you wouldn't see for a decade and within an hour you know everything thats happened and he's bought you lunch and now you're having a sleepover. Despite his own flaws and problems he may be dealing with he won't hesitate to  put the people he loves ahead of himself, even if it could be his downfall
if you make a kel character analysis I’d be so excited 
I would probably have to do it on video since people don't tend to like long posts, but I don't know anything about editing, so I'd have to learn or simply write it even if it gets only 2 upvotes lol. But thanks for the comment, you are so nice . . Average Oneshot player W
> Kel also does so with Sunny in real world, treating him normally instead of being careful with his words, and I think this is why both Aubrey and Sunny liked him so much, he's always sincere and honest. . Honestly. Kel always felt like the type of person that knows what people need to hear even if they don't want to hear it, and unlike other people won't be afraid to say it. ~~is this because he's an impulsive little ADHD goblin just like me absolutely~~
I dunno. I feel like Kel has the best intentions but it's more likely than not some of the things he says just come out awkward. I imagine it's one of the reasons why his approach to Hero went so poorly after >!Mari's death!< alongside a myriad of other details (and a far more important reason) that are purely just headcanon material. He doesn't try to hurt people, it's just that sometimes he does on accident >!(hey would you look at that it's a recurring theme in the video game) (yes 'recurring theme' means it only happens twice)!< even when his intentions are pure.. . I dunno. Maybe I'm just headcanoning and projecting too much.
I think you're right. I'm like 80% sure it's just me subconsciously bringing my headcanons into *canon,* which is a problem I have a lot (especially when I'm active writing fics oops). I agree with what you said about Hero lashing out at Kel being unexpected; there's not a lot of in-game evidence to know exactly what happened, and it leaves a lot of space for my mind to fill in the blanks. When you have ADHD that can be a good thing for getting the creative juices flowing and attaching to the character more but also likes to work against discussing actual *canon.*. . I'm not saying that Kel *did* hurt people, I'm saying that's how I can imagine his character being sometimes. Yeah, he means the best, and yeah, he's a good person, but he's undeniably a bit obtuse and direct. He'll genuinely try his hardest to be there for people and say what he thinks they need to hear, but sometimes that's just not what's necessary. Like I said --- probably my headcanons meshing with what's actually canon again, but I think it's some really interesting potential that I wish was explored a bit more.
I have ADHD too (and im also a Hispanic basketball player, so I'm 100% the  himself) but I don't think he usually hurts people even if he does by accident. For example, we know that he sometimes engages in a little trolling with  but what people don't remember is that her also engages in some tomfoolery with him. It's not like he bullied her on a daily basis by stealing her Mr. Plantegg and stuff, she also did stuff to him like mocking his mole on...? Fr, where the hell was that mole that was so embarrassing for him !? I guess we'll never know lol. . Tbh, my personal guess is that Hero's and Kel's parent never spoke about Mari after the incident with Hero, as we can see he never visits "her" until you reunite with all the gang, and maybe Kel mentioned her name and that was excuse enough for him to lash out. This theory gets reinforced when we see that right after this he got much better, probably felt comfortable talking about her again (at least a little bit), so Kel literally "sacrificed" himself just to get Hero's better. A true bro out there . . I don't really think he could hurt anyone even by accident, and if he did, he probably corrected that mistake atm. I remember some fanart of him taking Aubrey's plush and her being unable to get it back, and the moment he sees her almost start to cry he gives it back immediately to her surprise (He doesn't like to see her cry after all ). I don't remember if this is implied or referenced to have happened in game, but that's pretty much how I imagine Kel: If he sees he is taking it too far, he'll correct himself to not make the other person feel sad
> I have ADHD too (and im also a Hispanic basketball player, so I'm 100% the :21603: himself) but I don't think he usually hurts people even if he does by accident.. . I think that's just a difference with how we view the game's characters, honestly. Maybe it's because I'm used to looking at a lot of series through a *much* darker lens (looking at you AA), I dunno.. . . > For example, we know that he sometimes engages in a little trolling with :2477: but what people don't remember is that her also engages in some tomfoolery with him. It's not like he bullied her on a daily basis by stealing her Mr. Plantegg and stuff. . I mean, it's important to remember that was in *Headspace.* The entire point of the characters in Headspace is that they're exaggerated versions of how Sunny views (or more accurately *wants* to view) everybody; Aubrey is easy to annoy, a bit over-emotional, and pretty petty but ultimately forgiving with a not-so-subtle crush on Sunny/Omori, Kel is annoying, cocky, pushy and scatterbrained but genuinely means well and does his best to help everybody, and Hero is well-put together, charming, and responsible. . . That being said, agreed. Kel's not a bully, he's just a bit mischevious. He's probably a bit meaner in Headspace since they were all kids and kids are obviously less restrained than mature (or as mature RW Kel is) individuals alongside being farcical exaggerations.. . > Tbh, my personal guess is that Hero's and Kel's parent never spoke about Mari after the incident with Hero, as we can see he never visits "her" until you reunite with all the gang, and maybe Kel mentioned her name and that was excuse enough for him to lash out.. . That's pretty solid. I like that, actually. My headcanon is... well, a *lot* darker, so I'm not going to touch it with a ten foot pole right now unless you're comfortable with it. I would say it's up to interpretation for me but their fight is a very vital part of my fic so it's kinda too late to change it unless I want to rewrite Kel and Hero's entire arcs, which is a lot of work. (And I already did that for Hero. I don't wanna do it again ;.;). . > I don't really think he could hurt anyone even by accident, and if he did, he probably corrected that mistake atm.. . On that, we're 100% agreed. Kel is definitely remorseful in RW, and I imagine that if he slips up (and notices he slips up) he's very quick to apologize and try to make things right. It's part of the reason why I imagine he would be the first to >!forgive Sunny and Basil.!< . . > I remember some fanart of him taking Aubrey's plush and her being unable to get it back, and the moment he sees her almost start to cry he gives it back immediately to her surprise (He doesn't like to see her cry after all :2461:).. . You will give me that fanart and you will give it now. I need that injected directly into my veins.. . > If he sees he is taking it too far, he'll correct himself to not make the other person feel sad. . Agreed, 100%. He's a bit annoying (a "prick" in HS!Aubrey's terms) and maybe takes it too far sometimes but he's not malicious. He's a good soul at the end of the day. He doesn't even mock Hero over spiders even when Hero makes fun of his grades, for Pete's sake! That alone makes him a better person than me.
About the HS stuff, yeah it's obvious it's all exaggerated, but what I meant is that the basics were there. . And about the fanart, took me about half an hour but finally got it. Want it on DM? I don't think I can send it from here lol (funny how my account is 2 years old yet I've only started using it since a couple of months ago lol)
> but what I meant is that the basics were there. . Fair. But in that sense it arguably bolsters the claim that sometimes Kel does stupid shit and wins stupid prizes, like what happened with Space Ex-Husband.. . > Want it on DM? I don't think I can send it from here lol (funny how my account is 2 years old yet I've only started using it since a couple of months ago lol). . You absolutely can! The way to send hyperlinks over Reddit is by surrounding the text with [] and the link with (), which gets you something like [this.]() That being said, if you prefer to send it over DMs that's dope too!
Too much stuff for my brain to understand lol. U think I'll stick to the DM tbh. But that gotta be tomorrow, need my 8 hours of Sleep lol
Hah, mood. Sleep well!
They didn't name Kel's brother Henry. That doesn't chronologically make sense lol.
Why wouldn't it chronologically make sense mhm?
Yeah, and? What's your point lol? I'm saying he was named Henry, then Kelsey was born, then Sally. . What's your point going around insulting when you don't even know what you're saying lmao?
You didn't get the joke after I explained it.
Well, in fact you didn't explain it at all lol
I won't bother anymore
Why you gotta be rude? You literally didn't explain anything in that deleted comment lol
in one of omocats streams she shows the first draft of faraway town. above kel and heros house it says 'Kelsey and Henry's house'
I literally watched that video 5 minutes ago when I was looking about info for Aubrey's, Kel and Hero's real name. The timing lol. . And yeah, thanks for the info bro! I'm sure most people who haven't watched it yet will find it useful 
its shockingly not very well known but it is very interesting 
I mean, by that logic Kelsey wouldn't be Kel's full name either since it's only on old trailers and promotional images. I just take this as a headcanon since, like you said, it's the closest thing to a canon name Hero has. . So Kelsey, Aubergine and Henry it is for me 
in one of omocats streams she shows the first draft of faraway town. above kel and heros house it says 'Kelsey and Henry's house'
Tbf, going by their logic if the demos names werent the final names, the first drafts DEFINITELY werent the final names.
Kid named Aubergine: . . But it's not even a tweet for fun, in the original drafts it's revealed Kel and Hero were going to be addressed as Kelsey and Henry, Basil was Rowan and Aubrey was Aubergine. . Apart from that, Aubrey has to be a short for some name, much like Kel. My headcanon is that Kel and Aubrey just don't like their names and made up each other's nicknames  (I'm not mentioning Hero because it's revealed she was addressed as that long before they met Sunny and Mari by their family due to his obsession to Hero Sandwiches )
Hero’s name is in fact Henry, and kels full name is Kelsey. I refuse to believe though that Aubrey’s name is aubergine.
[aubergine]()
I’m honestly not sure if the tweet “proving” her full name of Aubergine is a joke or not. It just seems too on the nose for a character named Aubergine to have a plushie eggplant lmao
Kels real name is actually kaleidoscope but “kal” sounded weird and it sounds like kel anyways so everyone went with that. Source: me
“The source is I made it the fuck up”
. . now it's canon
"Imagine a world, Sunny, free of cancel culture! Where no-one can call me out for my outlandish claims! A world where I can say Kel's real name is Kaleidoscope!". . ^("...What?")
... headcanon accepted
It was revealed to me in a dream.
Kel is in it so sadly, yes.
Yes. Now, because of this Kel omoji, it's even more canon! 
OMG OMOJI
bruh kel stands for bald, everbody knows this is canon 
Kel's real name is actually Keldeo
None of these names are canon in the game. Sure they were referred to as Kelsey and Henry (not Aubergine this one is just not true) in earlier versions of the game, but i would not consider these canon, as they were not the full game. So Kel is just Kel and Hero is unknown.  . Also i wouldn't consider anything not found in the game canon
Yes heros name is Henry. And Kel name was gonna be Kelsey if kel was a girl bit he's not. Since all the main characters had concept art as the opposite gender
Kel and Hero’s beta names were Kelsey and Henry, so it’s possible those could be their real names, but Aubrey’s real name can’t be Aubergine, it’s a vegetable, it’s like naming your child Carrot. You just wouldn’t.
People named Pepper and Kale crying rn.
There is speculation about Kel being short for Kelsey and Hero's real name being Henry, but I ain't ever heard of no "Aubergine" 🍆🍆🍆
It is now that kel is involved in the meme
if i had a nickel for everytime someone made loss using my bubble wrap comment, id have 2 nickels which is omega hyper real
Nah, use Kel pass to become happy and slice them up with your knife
Pray you know how to do the Kel nuke, >!and have the chicken ball equipped. !<Otherwise, revert to your last save and skip this area, the rewards are kind of, meh.
There's no way anyone playing blind has that at this point. Most don't even make it to the area in general and even if they reached the top level, they'd just fight the enemy as usual, it'll run and that's the end of it. There's no indication it actually has anything or will leave permanently
You definitely don't need Kel nuke or Chicken Ball here, just abuse the emotions of the bears by making them sad with Omori and attack with the other three characters.  If you have the chicken ball at that point, that means you were strong enough to get to the top floor of Dino Dig and were fast enough to kill the chicken at the top- also meaning you're definitely strong enough to fight the rare bear onslaught.  . . Didn't know about coffee, Kel nuke, or the chicken ball my first playthrough and this part was a cakewalk using the above strategy.
Or… you know, just find the gimmick?
I was like "NO! I'M GOING TO DIE!" and then I was like "I am the strongest here...Kel, nuke them."
What I did was constantly have Aubrey use counter, kel use curveball, hero be on standby for healing or tea time, and omori using either stab or just regular attacks. This worked pretty well with only a few bumps in the road whenever kel couldn't get the bears immediately happy or sad
Look, all I'm saying is that if it was Kel who fell, he would have survived

unintelligent specimen 
unintelligent specimen  ￼​
unintelligent specimen 
His name is Shithead and he is a single celled organism

























HAPPY CAKE DAY! 
He fell for a watermelon mimic. . In the bestiary entry for those Omori says that their disguise is shit and only a fool would fall for it, Kel then immediately admits he fell for it.
Cause Headspace Kel is unintelligent. Sunny and Omori created him to be unintelligent. Real Kel is alright though.
Real Kel is still somewhat unintelligent, but he makes up for it with maturity. He's still pretty tactless, but he tries his best.
"He's not just a regular moron. He's the product of the greatest mind  of a generation working with the express purpose of building the dumbest moron who ever lived."
“ We made him stupid as a joke”
I AM NOT A MORON 
WELL HOW ABOUT NOW, COULD A MORON KEL-NUKE YOU INTO BEING TOAST, HUH? COULD A MORON DO THAT? 
I wouldn’t say that he’s unintelligent, I’d say he has adhd lol
This ☝️
Because he dumb
Shhh, he might hear you
I said this only about Headspace Kel
That makes sense
He still can come at you.
What’s he gonna do, eliminate my brain wav
Or nuke your house 
(Vegetable (like the condition) sounds (there are no sounds, he wiped out all of my brain waves))
“I may be dumb. . …. . Yhea.”
“No it isn’t, Kel! You’re a gross color!”
Because Headspace Kel iq’s are in the negative, and was specifically designed by headspace to be A moron. Though I greatly refute the idea of Real world Kel being in any way dumb. (What’s with people making funny and optimistic characters in fanfics act dumber than A sea sponge?)
LONG LIVE REAL WOLRD KELSEY 
He's less dumb irl and more tactless
Exactly.
Idk about that tbh rw kel scares me

Kel confirmed as a himbo in the future.
Because he is an unintelligent creature 
I can confirm, this is true and Kel might just be an *unintelligent specimen.*



He needs two to be equal to one unintelligent species.

Oh no I still think the clothes mean something, most likely just a little detail
when you point it out it doesnt look real... i swear this is fake but everyone says its true, i do not remember snyone other than omor and kel having this little thingy
I love the mandela effect.. . . Btw these are official sprites.
I just realized it may be bc most of the game you only see kel and sunny.
I just realized irl kel have hairy feet
For real its was funny- . Even the Kel's lines before that-
u/KelGoodman
i feel like it depends on the accent. People with an American accent would say bay-sul, but people from the UK would most likely say bah-sul.
Bay-sil is the American Pronunciation, while Baa-sil is the British Pronunciation.. . Considering the game takes place in the US, it's more likely to be Bay-sil.
Forget if God can bleed, CAN KEL BLUSS??
But do you pronounce it bay-gil or ba-gel, with the gel sounding more like kel
Bag-el
Superman's Jewish side of the family.
You Britta’d it
Gettin rid a Britta
Of course Kel would say that
Funnily enough, I asked this question in a poll a while back! I pronounce it as bah-sil too, since that’s the traditional way to pronounce it as a person’s name, but it does seem like the majority of players pronounce it bay-sil. If you’re going for a technically “correct” pronunciation based on traditional naming conventions, bah-sil is most likely more correct, but if you’re going for a pronunciation like the name of the herb either pronunciation is correct, as it is pronounced differently in different regions.
I'm pretty sure they would.  Knowing how court systems work, they'd most likely end up in at least juvenile detention or jail for manslaughter.  Children end up in jail all the time for murder, so I think this would be no different
Therapist confidentiality is a thing
Not when it's endangering to yourself or others, even if the thing already happened.
Again, the danger has to be immediate. I have no idea where you got the last part. This extends to abuse, suicidal behavior. Even if it did somehow magically happen to fall within the boundaries of being able to break confidentiality (it doesn’t), the therapist isn’t required to disclose said information.
And Kel’s therapy would be having a friend to talk to. Everybody had their own troubles to try and overcome but in the wake of the fallout everyone kinda abandoned Kel, even Hero did in his depression. I’m pretty sure Sunny’s mother mentions that Kel is pretty lonely before he drags Sunny out of the house. I feel kinda bad for the guy that’s always the happiest and most sociable being pretty isolated and lonely for 4yrs
Yea, I feel like Kel’s trauma is overlooked because he always pretends to be happy. This boy really needs to sort through his emotions
kel- you already KNOW that boy bottles up and hides his emotions, poor thing. . . also cause i’m a simp
Kel lookin like he’s thinking “hoops aren’t the only thing I can shoot…”
NOOOO
Kel
Nobody has been saying Kel. This boy needs therapy!
Kel. He is constantly overlooked for the sake of everyone else. Look at the comments so far and you’ll see my point
I just wrote a whole thing about how in-universe he’s overlooked and becomes lonely and isolated because of the fallout.. . Bro dealt with isolation and nobody (hell even in-universe) picks up on this
He had to deal with not only his friends being withdrawn but also HIS BROTHER being withdrawn and being overlooked by his parents so that they could care for HERO when kel was going through the same thing. Not only that but his best friend of them all became a shut in and his other friends started hating each other. He was probably so lonely and felt so invisible but he never over came it, even in the end of the game his pain was over looked
I feel like this is either misinterpretation or using how past kel felt to see how present kel feels. Present kel has a support group, is going out of his way to make new friends, and participates in activities with others regularly. He's easily the one that's healed the most and he has been frequently shown using Mari's death as a stepping stone for lack of a better word (ba dum tss) as he uses it to motivate others and, importantly, himself.. . Kel definitley isn't perfectly healed or anything like that, but I feel like a lot of people underestimate him. A lot of people I see seem to have this idea that kel lifts people above him while he goes unchecked but it's kind of the opposite. He lifts people up to his level and wants to take them higher with him
Kel is therapy 
Kel is just really good at stifling it
True but still I'm not wrong with him needing it the least
Okay first, this image goes hard, second, imma give it to kel, have you SEEN how Supa depressionatoed he is?!?
Kel
kel :D
Kel. Idc what y’all say he needs it.
KELHE HAS TRAUMA TOO!!!
kel. poor boy has nobody to comfort him and he always buries his feelings to help others :(
Probably kel be uas eorang. .

kel
thats pretty unlikely seeing how nobody else seems to change clothes (besides kel in one tag photo, i think thats the only 2 times it happens) so it at lest probably wasnt the intention
no, i noticed this with >! RW kels pixel sprite being lighter than his RW drawn sprite, i think its just a stylistic choice for the most part. not a big deal !< 
Some game console and a set of headphones, either a bed or some very comfy set of blankets and pillows to resemble one, and likely a small fridge with some snacks in it. Id also like for there to be a window with the curtains closed, essentially to resemble the lightbulb.
I would have a laptop still, a Rubik's Cube, an unresponsive yoyo, my Kel plush, a light that isn't too bright but enough to see, and a chair with wheels.
10th will be " kel screaming for 10 hours"

When KEL said "It's KELin time" and Kel'd everybody

Yea, she can she appeared after Kel and Heir left my party and it scared the shit out of me
>!Running kel in black space 2!<
 "Hi OMORI!" *nyOOM*
The first time I got actually scared/unsettled was during the Boss fight.. . Now, everything would be most likely fine if I didn't fuck with skills, but I made Omori happy... Let's say "Omori did not succumb" took a bigger toll on me because of that.
The doors jumpscare. . I acctually never played the game and instead watched a playthrough of it and when >! Kel knocked on the door i was like "nope, don't do this. I'd not get scammed like this the second time!" Which would mean i'd be one of the not so many people that did the hikkikomori route as my first run if i acctually played the game!< And this fact has been stuck with me to this day.. . Edit: ok maybe it wasn't the scariest, just unexpected as a jumpscare should be. The most unnerving thing was running away from that big yellow cat abomination.

This is hurting my brain
Sunny and Mari Hikik, Hero and Kel Kel, Basil Oregano, Aubrey Van Hellsing.. . I am not discussing this further
For some reason my headcanon for Kel's second name was always Kel Salamanca. Maybe because of his rock Hector... 🛎🛎🛎
Sunny and Mari: Dahmerson. . Kel and hero: Rodriguez. . Basil: Dahmer. . Aubrey: Ricci. . Just kidding all their last names are actually "Keltchup"

Sunny Suzuki  . Mari Suzuki  . Henry "Hero" Rodriguez  . Kelsey "Kel" Rodriguez   . Basil Oregano   . Aubrey Smith   . . . I can't imagine Aubrey with alas name that isn't a common white name, or Kel and Hero without common Hispanic last names, or Basil with a last name that isn't also a herb. Majority of OMORI fanfics i read use Suzuki as the last name for Sunny and Mari and it's grown on me.
kel de la cruz

Kel came to my house and knocked on my door
ah yes, same thing that happened to me
Same here
the one who knocks
Lol
Hey, it looked cool. Ask yourself, what would Kel do? Would he draw red pixels in eyes? Yes he would.
That one “loop this video” video of kel (idk if this is specific enough or not) I thought kel looked cool and looked through the comments forever until I found what game it was
think i saw a gif of ecstatic kel, i liked the art style and 2 days later im depressed
My S/O started using this emoji of Kel smiling called :pain: in the discord server. i asked them where it was from and only sort of regret asking
The secret ingredient is crime
You hear the sound of the cash register when Kel is getting the big bag of candy tho
He stole money from the cash register to buy the candy
<- violating the law
 <- assisted murder, arson, breaking and entering, tax evasion, tax fraud, first second and third degree murder, aggravated assault
 <- committed several war crimes in Bosnia
 <- loitering
 <------ definitely had murdered countless people. .  <------- yeah we know what you did
< breaking and entering
 <------ all of the crimes
he lied
Based Kel 
Kel is the REAL villain of Omori 
the betrayal 
She believed
Sbeve

He had money in his pocket
Exactly what I thought. He may have had enough pocket money to buy a bag of candy, but not the $20 book
Personally I always just assumed Kel lied about not having money. The real reason he got Sunny out of the house was to save 20 bucks.
Yeah you can steal it back from hess closet and even get a achievement for it
Rolled a 20 on charismatic this time
and the candy shopkeeper (forgot her name) rolled a 1 for the dc
He had 5 dollar on him which was enough
Kel remembered the saying "it isn't illegal if you don't get caught"
. . >!*Lies and deceit,* **lies and deceit,** ***LIES AND DECEIT***!<
He probably just didn't have $20 on him but had enough for the candy
Something tells me he did have his wallet...
. . Sir, we've arrested this man for multiple war crimes in Croatia, what do you mean?
He’s the kinda guy who would owe you something and then forget to pay it back for the rest of his life, I don’t think he actually forgot his wallet.. . He’s also the kinda guy who would put check his pocket, feel his wallet, and think it’s something else so instead of pulling it out he just assumes he doesn’t have his wallet. . Both explain the situation pretty well I think.
I remember someone saying kel is canonically a thief, so maybe he's just a hoodlum
The bag was not full of candy, Kel has connections 
Who said he paid for it? 
Kel:. . 
Thievery 
he lied
Kel is Kel
theft 😫
Because he paid for it , that's why I steal from him every time, lying bastard says he will pay me back yet doesn't
emergency backup bag
He had help from a gundam
His wallet teleported 
Probably paid it back later
> He pays
20 dollar
 Ah, the enigma of Kel's candy payment! Perhaps Kel has mastered the skill of candy alchemy, turning mere pocket lint into sweet treats. Or maybe he's secretly a candy-loving ninja, capable of swift candy acquisitions without his wallet. It's just another mysterious twist in the world of OMORI
That bitch

Kel is conning sunny
He just has loose money in his pocket.
I actually was wondering as well
my guess is, kel only tried getting sunny out of the house to try and save 20 dollars, but wasn't expecting him to actually come out
Teleportation poweurs
Free candy
Especially with the inflation that candy has in that town, like... damn.
the bag of candy would be a lot cheaper than $20 my guess is that he just had spare change
I think he had pocket change, but left his actual spending money at home. I do that myself a lot.. . Bags of miscellaneous candies at grocery stores are usually only a few cents a pound, he could’ve bought it for like three bucks.
Is he stupid?
i assumed he had some pocket change or something but not his wallet. considering it was the early 2000s a bag of candy wouldnt have been more than 2-3 bucks, if that
He had like 4 bucks in his pocket which is enough to buy candy but not book
Pockets?
crime 😎😎🤑🤑
Easy, Kel is a wanted felon
I’m not violating the law

Same reason I don’t think Kel would like any sport games tbf. . They’d rather do the real thing
Bro would main Little Mac in Smash
I think Kel would play tf2, he would be that one friendly heavy on 2fort
Kel would play basketball
Underrated comment
Kel would play Sonic
I was thinking the SAME THINGG
Kel plays those games that are bad on purpose
Kel might be a sonic guy because of his ... quirks
Everyone would play multiplayer games of Stardew valley together!. And Kel 100% played Sonic Adventure 2
kel plays yakuza
I feel like the whole gang would have an annual 2 week minecraft phase. Mari and Hero would build houses and other buildings together. Basil would definitely build actual farms and decorate everything. Kel would go mining and Sunny would probably join Kel or watch tutorials on how to build iron farms/mob farms etc.
pizza tower would play kel
Kel definitely plays roblox
Kel plays Nintendo or sonic games
kel would be playing NBA2K
Kel 100% plays Fortnite and absolutely sucks at it
Kel either NBA y2k or any silly game
Kel for SURE plays NBA 2K.
Kel def likes RDR2
I feel like Kel would beat Sans on the first try without any experience
Kel dame dame
idk about the others but Kel would for sure play NBA Jam.
kel plays nba2k no doubt
Kel would play mainstream Games Like GTA or Rocket League since he goes Out a bunch. Aubrey plays rage Games (idk she seems Like someone who would). Basil plays relaxing Games Like Animal Crossing. Sunny Most likely sweats League. And Hero doesn't actively Play Most likely
Kel would definitely play rocket league, omori would be good at rhythm games
i feel like Kel would like the really bad sonic games from the 2000s
I think it's more likely he's terrified of people who have beaten him up numerous times in the past.
We don't know but people take as real usually because it's was unlikely 2 people get hallucination at the same time . Also spoiler
And done now its tagged. Yeah honestly with this game you can never be too certain what classifies as a spoiler.
Real world usually is have to be tagged spoiler
I'll keep that in mind then

mass hysteria
Yeah, true plus this is a fictional universe stuff like this is common to occur.. . Although your likelyhood to believe is predicated on your own personal beliefs. It seems people are leaning more towards epicurian philospopy in this sub reddit
there was a scrapped female kel design that existed, what was its purpose then?
Kel is cooler than sans at least
only right opinion
I platonically ship Kel with Bacon Cheeseburger
Again trying to imply I don't know what it means and pushing your skewed ideals as fact, you have the freedom to do that if you wish but it's abbhorant to try and force those ideals upon others when clearly you are opposed by so many on this stance that in the end is trying to push guilt upon people for being invested in something they care about.. . Yes if I saw random kids at a park and it seemed like 2 of them really liked each other I might think they should just tell each other how they feel and possibly start seeing each other because it would most likely bring them happiness, this is the basic premise for thousands of stories but for some reason because you say it's weird nobody should ever do it as if the act of viewing a story restricts any and all from participating in that specific scenario because you will it to be.. . You're clearly set in your views and maintain your stance believing your morally in the right regardless of the logical fallacies I point out to you and are even vindictive enough to downvote each post I make and I see no further reason to debate this with you any further as it's simply a waste of both of our time.
Whether I'm in the minority or not legitimately means nothing to me, and doesn't suddenly make me wrong. I've been massively downvoted on this sub for saying an irl situation of an adult and a minor having a seexual relationship is wrong, and that the adult is a predator for seeking that relationship. Since I was downvoted and everyone opposed me, does that automatically make me in the wrong? Does that make what that man did morally okay? I'm not forcing my ideals on anyone, but I will continue to say how morally wrong it is that people here think it's okay for adults to have relationships with children, and think it's okay to fantasize about children.. . . Not even gonna bother with your second paragraph. Don't creep on children, don't "ship" irl people. This is common decency.
undertale: brother x brother, teenager x adult skeleton, "mother" x teenager, "mother" x adult skeleton, innocent goat x a kid serial killer, serial killer x teenager, flower x teenager and flower x serial killer (there are a lot of others but i told out the major ones)
Kel
KEL!
KEL
Kel
Kel, and you have to drink an orange joe (it’s just coffee and oj)
Kel
Kelkel
Kel because he’s cool and awesome
>!kel!<
\-AND KEL IS PEE HAHA RIGHT GUYS
No, Kel’s is Orange Joe
Not even a question there
Lol
The kel one.
GET KEL
I like kel’s and omori’s the most (even though it looks like piss and coom respectively)
kel
Kel
Kel, but only DW version
Dark world version??
dream world
It'll always be Deltarune dark world Kel to me
Lancer <-> 
Nah we need to get the medic bags (it's a death wish heist)
Kel fr could eat a nail to disprove the corrosive capacity of the stomach
Not exactly 'hate', but I think Kel, especially the HS version, would kinda grate on my nerves.
When Kel said something like “I miss when Basil used to remind me to wash my hands” yeah I wouldn’t deal with that irl 💀
Damn y’all are fake fans. Only real Kel enjoyers keep at least six days without washing our hands or taking a shower 🔥🔥
i would fs have a crush on high school kel
Kel. I kin him, I love him, but would still hate him for his nasty stuff even though I kind of do the same disgusting bullshit he does. ☠️
What nasty stuff do you mean exactly?
Kel is the kinda guy to ask “pull my finger!” and then proceeds to demolish your nostrils
Idk like. Always being sweaty, drinking expired things or mixing weird drinks that don't even go good with each other, making weird nasty food combinations or even eating bread with mustard only. ☠️☠️ Stuff that is considered disgusting but I find fun.
Nah dude drinking expired orange joe isn’t nasty at all how dare you
Tbh orange joe tastes good so yeah, it ain't nasty, didn't try it expired yet tho 😼
It's sadly gotta be Kel, I've dealt with narcissists before so I could tolerate even Sweetheart, but Kel? he would completely exhaust me and the worst thing is that I would feel bad if I had to tell him to leave me alone, so yeah... >!I wouldn't blame Sunny for not opening that door!<. . Now if I had to choose who I'd get along with the most, it's definitely Basil
Kel.
Kel is great, but I wouldn't have the energy to deal with him on a daily basis.
Kel. I personally am not a fan of the best bud energy that he radiates.. . But hes a good character.
Had a friend like Kel, turns out I don’t like people like Kel.
Kel (please don’t kill me)
I agree, but just because he's kind of... always positive (even if people don't want to) and don't understand when others just want to be left alone. Apart from that, I think we would be friend ^w^
If i’m fully honest, Kel.. . If i was his friend i wouldn’t want to be dragged out of the house at midnight just to look at comics, i gotta sleep.
Kel
Kel, there’s no way he would ever shut up
Kel has too much social energy for me if I'm being honest
tw: opnions, may be triggering since some people cant handle it. . >!kel. like i really like kel but i feel like he would be annoying asf!<
Thx! . . Fuck you. You useless piece of shit. You absolute waste of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swine, you’re an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole. The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did. When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality. After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society. No wonder your father questioned whether or not your were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member. Your birth made it so that mankind is worse of in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover into a state of organization. Everything has forever fallen into a bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune. I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell. You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted sac religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair. You are an idiotic, shiteating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. Rhodes Island would have been better off if you'd never joined us. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being. Even this worlds finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are. Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe. In the future there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists, and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now. You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet you manage to make it so that that is only a small part of the evil that is your being. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an eldrich abomination, but here you are. It’s hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you. Even if time travel some day will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to before this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors if they failed would have to many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it. I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did. The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant. Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring. You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the infected plague apparently only happened with the goal of teaching humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankind’s greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created. If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched. You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents, but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again. The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe. I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating working as hard and efficiently as possible, yet there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world. You are an irresponsible, idiotic, disgusting, unloved, horrible excuse for a living being who’s soul contains less humanity than every ginger in history combined. The absolute disgust I feel when thinking about anything that has even a slight resemblance to anything that might have to do with you and your unholy actions is so incredibly great that when I am honest about it I think that even I do not posses a consciousness great enough to comprehend my own feelings about it.
it’s not a copypasta. Its a copyspaghetti. 
AYO WHATS ALL OVER THE PLACE?!!? 
Oh my bad bro I thought you were referencing something else
Copypasta? Like the enemy from the hir indie rpg OMORI, found in the area known as Orange Oasis???????!!
ok
I just skipped through it.
I have to admit that I find Aubrey and Kel cute together because Kel actually admitted he found her cute. And he also got flustered when Aubrey asked him "Oh so you found me cute? Is that why you were always teasing me back then?". I just find it funny.. Then again, I don't really see Kel in any kind of romance, but who knows?
Well, for whatever reason (idk tbh why) I dislike Kelbrey (and I think that it's unlikely), Cotton Candy and Photobomb seems very unlikely, Sunflower is not my cup of tea (tho I find it cute) and it's unlikely, I love Suntan but it's not likely as well so Sunburn is my choice.
that's fair, i don't really think i DISLIKE any ships (that are legal) i just prefer some to others more often than not. . &#x200B;. . im sure i can pretty much enjoy anything thats well written enough!
that's fine some ships dont vibe with me that much either!. . im not a big kelbrey guy myself..i don't HATE it or dislike it..i just don't vibe with it yaknow? 
To preface for anyone else reading this: I'm pretty mild when it comes to ships, so please don't downvote me with the assumption that I'm hating on Sunburn! I probably care less about ships than most other people here do. This isn't an attack or anything, just explaining why someone might also like Kelbrey/Baseball!. . Thank you for mentioning them! I wish more people humored the idea! I noticed that Kel and Aubrey are ALWAYS depicted as off to the side together in almost all the group pictures in the game, as well as in products like the calendar and postcards. If you want to get really analytical, Aubrey even looks flustered and embarrassed that Kel has his arm around her in the postcard illustration (which took me off guard at the time)! I also definitely see it as her being camera-shy, but the possibility that this detail meant something else was something that made me think.. . I'm also just a sucker for teasing and banter in relationships, and Kel and Aubrey would have PLENTY of that.. . NO HATE to anyone who disagrees, though! In regards to Sunburn, I personally got the impression that Sunny had an unrequited crush on an idealized version of Aubrey in his head (who, of course, liked him back in his ideal dream world.. There isn't really any evidence of her liking him in the real world that I can remember, though. Also, she didn't even consider Sunny's feelings at all after you-know-what happened, which tells me she probably kind of overlooked him in their friend group at times), and it wouldn't really work out after the changes they've been through since their childhoods. I do think Sunny's crush on her and their friendship is really cute, though, so I guess I like unrequited childhood Sunburn? Lol. . When it comes to pairings after the truth is revealed, Kel and Aubrey make the most sense to me as well, since they have the least change in their dynamic and have the least amount of reasons to avoid each other. However, I don't really mind what happens that much as long as it's right for the characters.. . Anyway, I don't get overly invested in ships, but I thought I'd reply since I haven't seen a lot of people give Kelbrey a chance. I think it's a fun dynamic, and I wish more people considered it worthwhile! . . Again, NO SHADE OR DISRESPECT to people who disagree! Hopefully we can all peacefully coexist and agree to disagree on this!
Thank you for this, I completely agree. Welcome to the kelbrey club it’s literally just me and you lol
I'll also join the Kelbrey club! There may be few of us but we're not alone at least lol
im cool with kelbrey i just prefer them as a brother sister dynamic than anything romantic! its cool if you do! 
Not too into shipping. I do however view it as the more likely romance, as I need to make the least amount of assumptions off the canon to make it work.
its cool but i prefer kelbrey
I'm mixed between yes and no lol-. . I also like Kel-Brey (if that's the right ship name) because it reminds me of me and my bf (because I'm short and stubborn but he's a twink who's fun in the annoying way lol)
It's most likely satire
kel is egg confirmed?!?!?!
20-30 USD most likely
I bet 40
This sounds the likeliest to me, knowing about the Omori plushies and their price.
Hopefully. Kinda why I didn’t buy any. Tbh, they are kinda overpriced (in my opinion) but a real world Kel might have to come home 
remind me, is the game cheaper than the figures??
On steam, yeah
on nintendo too
honestly i kinda see that as a good thing, if they make most of their profit on merch then that means the game can be cheaper and more people get to play it    .     . still wish i could justify getting more than one of these figures though
This is… actually awesome.. . Omori is MUCH more deep and expansive than your average $20 game.
... Honestly, your first sentence makes no sense.
ok me saying "most of" their profit was probably not accurate, most people who buy Omori wont be buying merch. but thats an actual strategy for indie games, to have the game price low to get the game into peoples hands, and sell merch to make up for the cost
Uhuh...
For me, yes
Nintendo, yes, steam, not sure, Xbox, not sure
Was gonna get them until I saw the price. I already have the plushies anyway.
Compared to a nendoroid these are a bargain
Nendoroids are high quality and have accessories and joints though
fr it’s embarrassing how the nenodroid is $40 with all these features and these figures are $28 and they can’t even move lmfao
This is the realest comment here
Ikr these figures are better off being like 5$
wouldn't say 5$, but maybe 10$ or 15$
Why the hell are you comparing thesse to nendoroid 💀
They both look similar
OVERPRICED?? this is a steal where I live... 😭
Same!
I think it’s already been hinted, so most likely yes
I hope so, I would totally get Real World Kel
. . We love Kel here
Ill buy rw kel plush if it ever comes out
Kel's crossbow training. For the Wii
Pokemon Green(or any of them that has lavender town) and he's most likely in lavender town
So really, any of the Pokémon games on the GameBoy. XD
Since that thing has a flat back and no cartridge inserted, it is likely actually an early iphone. so maybe he's playing flappy bird or something.
10 kel (many)
Kel is Sans theory
I mean, he is a sKELeton


Kelpelx $
I’m assuming around 40 buckaroos, using the ebay kel as reference
No,the hikkikomori is basically a sandbox route,you ignore kel every day when he knocks at the door to get it
Calling it a sandbox route is very misleading, you're not suddenly able to craft stuff in an open world. It's not Minecraft.
Kel woke up with too many burgers on his mind and had to share
Kel tricked him into eating yellow snow 
: "It's lenom flavored!"
Hey guys... why is Kel in a giant icecube?
: HEY GUYS, I’M INSIDE THE WORLDS LARGEST POPSICLE. AINT THAT COOL?!
Mr. Spamsum: \[JAWHAW HAW HAW HAW\] DIDNT SEE YA THERE \[Little Guys\] WHAT DO YOU NEED \[In These Trying Times\]? AN \[Egg\]? FOR THAT, YOULL NEED TO \[Sign Here\]
🗿
\#relatable
Kel pelted a snowball at Basil . . (also makes a bit sense because Kel’s snowball skill makes the opponent sad)
It'll probably take a while to be drawn. Then since it's also a monthly print for the Kodansha's seinan magizine, It'll likely take time for enough to make a volume, and after that, they'll have to translate it into English. So, my guess is that it's going to take a while for an official english volume to be produced and sent out.
Kel is absolutely the type of guy to mistakenly think he has the n-word pass
"You're a gross color KEL!"
Doubtful. Kel has made it pretty clear that Hero is very good at reading the room and holding conversation. He is extroverted for sure, but he likely hasn't made any genuine or meaningful friendships in college the same way he did with his Faraway Town friends.. . Also, i feel like a lot of people haven't realized not every college party is either "quaint" or "rager". he probably was at the midway mark and went with some college acquaintances
I mean both him and kel have more tanned skin than the rest of the friends, however both are also sporty, so it could just be that they are outside more than everyone else. I do tend to see them headcanoned as Latino in most fan fics. Since I don’t think it’s ever really stated in the game, and I don’t believe we ever see them speak Spanish (I might be wrong on that) it’s really up to you
in the game files the huge collection of family photos in kel and hero's house are called an ofrenda, very likely they were intended to be latino.. . . . beyond that there are small little bits that are particularly relatable for mexican families for example the plastic bags with plastic bags in them. this all comes from someone i know who is mexican.
Plastic bags with plastic bags inside? Yep. 100% Hispanic.
Haha this is a very Asian thing to do to. I’m Vietnamese and we all reuse the grocery bags
in the game files the huge collection of family photos in kel and hero's house are called an ofrenda, very likely they were intended to be latino.. .  . . beyond that there are small little bits that are particularly relatable for mexican families for example the plastic bags with plastic bags in them. this all comes from someone i know who is mexican.. . (Copy as pasted from Supreme Nadeem)
WHAT? YOU GUYS DONT USE PLASTIC BAGS?
I didnt even notice there was a kel lmao
I just realized EVERY character has a middle bang. . I can't believe we're in Trails of Cold Steel 3
KELSEY WE NEED TO COOK
Kel and Vance too XD
Why does Kel look like shaggy ? Yoinks
Genderbent Kel. . . (I like genderbent kel tho)
: I trust Kel's speed, and don't worry, these missiles won't destroy all of Faraway... just that lunatic.. . &#x200B;. . *Meanwhile*. . &#x200B;. . : fuck fuck fuck, come here you two!.. . : Wha-. . \*Kel grabs Aubrey and Hero and runs like never before in his life, breaking the legal speed limit... despite the immense pain in his legs, he manages to get out of range\*. . : Ouch, Kel what the heck?. . \*still passed out\*. . &#x200B;. . *Meanwhile*. . &#x200B;. . Hasta la vista, baby. . \*Basil activates the drone command and fires the missiles\*. . (Pursuit): Mari... I'm going to see you again.. . \*The fake Hero is completely bombarded leaving only remains of what was before a person and red mist (his blood)\*. . : HAH!, is over Sunny you are safe now!.. . : ... thanks Basil.. . &#x200B;. . *Meanwhile*. . &#x200B;. . : YES!, that fool is finally dead.. . : this is no over Kel we have to carry Hero to the hospital.. . : Oh shoot is true, let's hurry up.
Kel looks like Charliie Brown 
Why is Kel crying in the second picture
a nail from the bat has pierced his spine, he will never walk again
They have that sibling rivalry relationship.. . Like they could turn to each other in times of need, and they'd have each other's backs, but they also fight about everything.. . Also:. . : Kel, your stupid. . : No you. . ---. . Anybody other than Aubrey: Kel, your stupid. . : NO HE'S NOT! YOU F#@KING TAKE THAT BACK!!!
…is it just me or does her face look an awful lot like Kel? That… is a connection I don’t think I wanted to make
They all look similar. It's the artstyle.
Because he's like a little brother who proudly shows you his new sick kung-fu moves. . And if Kel wasn't there he'd actually beat the shit out of you
I did Angry strats all my first playthrough until I learned about Kel nuke and then switched to happy from there forward.
Same lol
Same here.
you should probably just search it up, but I believe you need to use coffee on kel, make him happy and idk how the other speed boosts are activated. anyway you then just use run n' gun and kel will deal absurd amounts of damage, enough to even one shot some bosses.
I believe it's just. . Coffee. Flex. Turn him to the second happy stage
I just now realized that making Kel Angry does nothing for run n gun. Woops.
haha something similar happened to me, it's pretty easy to mix the emotions up
Its wasn't even really a mix-up per say. My brain went "Angy = moar dmg" and didn't really think about it further than that. It only gives more attack, which Run n gun does not scale off of
i once fucked up SO bad, thinking sad is good against angry and then proceeded to die
max speed kel (as in, equip items that boost his speed) + coffee + happy + angry enemy + run n gun
I personally found that sad poem did the trick and I would use that early 3 energy on Aubrey looking to Kel for them both the get angry and get the damage buff on top, I would go Omori - sad poem, Aubrey attack then look at Kel, then Kel uses annoy on omori. It’s also funny annoying Omori then him immediately reading a poem looking pissed
I think the hardest I laughed during battle was when omori was manic and reading a sad poem to the foe- it was just absurdly funny to me for no reason XD
I pick the thing where Omori starts off happy, attack the enemy with him, use Aubrey to make her and kel happy, Kel makes enemy angry and Hero defends first round. Then Omori mocks enemy, Auby defends, Kel attacks and Hero cooks for whoever got damaged
Someone starting off happy. . Maybe the Dandelion item? And yeah I’ve been using that for Omori, especially in tandem with Lucky Slice
I did literally the same thing, feels like the game encouraged it
haven’t played in a long while but I remember like 50% of the time making everyone angry, 40% of the time using sadness, and 10% making Kel happy when i felt like letting him go wild.
Unleash the beast 
Happy. Two words, Kel Nuke.
My strat was to start by attacking with Kel and passing his ball to Omori to make him Happy/Ecstatic, and spam Lucky Slice. Then use Aubrey’s various skill’s to make her and Kel Ecstatic as soon as possible, and span Run N’ Gun with Kel.. . Hero was also there. He made us yummy snack’s.
Nukelear Bomb
Mostly used Omori’s trip to make the enemy sad and angered my party with Kel’s megaphone. Worked like a charm most fights.
Angry is, I usually make Omori make the enemy sad, than make everyone else super pissed with Kel, works extremely well
Yes. For me, making enemies angry/sad was bad because it boosted their attack/defense, so they were happy. Then I made everybody sad but kel
I use anger, but I’m think on using happy more given Kel becomes a better attacker then aubery with the right set up and run and gun.
Anger for my first playthrough, now I kinda use whatever. I use happy mostly for Kel nukes.
Angry, cause of the megaphone on Kel, you can get the emotions set up in one turn
Anger. My go-to strategy was utilizing Kel’s angering abilities, Aubrey looking at Kel, and Omori’s sad poems on the enemy. But I’ve never heard of Kel nuking until these comments, I’ve gotta try it out my next run through lol.
#kel nuke
Ecstatic Kel + Run and Gun + Angry Enemy + Defense Down + WHEN I FLEX I FEEL MY BEST had demonic evil results
Happiness is Overall the best emotion. Using Coffee Kel Nuke and Rose Hairclip Omori for 100% Accurate Redhands vs Angry Enemies always provides the most damage.. . Sadness is the second best. Goes for a slower defensive style, but allows your team to to tank hits that would otherwise kill everyone. Very niche in the main game, but used it countless times when playing this mod . . Anger is overall the worst, the damage increase vs sad enemies def increase is pale compared to Happy Vs Anger. Not worth when you also get a defense drop. But for a casual playthrough where the power level doesn’t matter, it’s the best emotion to speedrun the game
Happy 100%, with later game abilities i could make all of my party happy in one turn, gave an item to Aubrey and Hero that started them happy, Aubrey has a special that makes her and another happy (made her ecstatic) that i used on Kel, then if Kel passed to Omori he'd get ecstatic. The binoculars increase Hit to 300 so Omori wouldn't miss, then since Kel almost always goes first he could annoy my opponents. Only fight I ever lost was the first encounter with the bear
always made everyone happy and then made kel annoy the opponent. Then have omori use mock :)
playing the game again, i find happy quite useful, specially considering i'm making all the enemies angry so that they drop more xp lol. . i I don't even remember what happy does (something with attack and defense i think) . Also with that strategy i can use "mock" with omori to reduce the enemy attack and Lucky side to make extra damage (i make omori maniac with team spirit and the follow-up kel attack) everything is calculated (almost)
Angry is the least one. Happy is the best one since it's essential for Kel nuke, also sadness can help with it too (for anyone wondering, make foe sad with OMORI, make Aubrey cheer Kel to make him happy, make Kel flex, Hero give Kel coffee, then Run & Gun the enemy, that's the most basic Kel nuke )
Megaphone, sadden the enemy, oneshot the enemy. . Or make Kel happy
Happy is incredibly busted, and you can get a super strong and reliable strategy going really early into the game. . . Equip daisy on omori, annoy with Kel and mock with Omori to get an instant moving attack that negates the attack boost from angry. Proceed to twirl/pep talk with Aubrey on Kel and enjoy curbstomping your enemies! . . Angry on enemies makes fights go by much faster thanks to the defence nerf, and you also get extra exp (or clams, I'm not quite sure)
Kel passing to omori for free ecstatic is how I start almost every battle 
Happy is very useful thanks to the Kel nuke . . Sadness is good too but sometimes it snowballs the fight out of control when I’m out of juice
A combo I like using is Kel uses annoy on enemy and then Omori mocks them. You basically have all the downsides of angry on enemy and they have no benefits
Happy due to kel nuke
Angry Aubrey Headbutt up until Kel's follow up with Omori makes him Omori ecstatic. Then its all happy with Kel starting happy and getting Omori ecstatic and Aubrey using team spirit on Hero. Then I just use Omori's Mock dealing a lot of damage with Kel's annoy.
Though there's a chance to miss when you are happy, making my team happy by using confetti and annoying the enemy with Kel was what I did to beat all bosses.  . . .  (also the game is just so sad, I wanna see them happy ;-;)
Happy, Kel nuke, nuff said. 
Mostly used anger on almost all the fights unless I had to switch emotions for the boss. Never did a Kel nuke on my first playthrough simply because I only learnt about it when I finally visited the subreddit after completing the game
happy, mainly because of Kel Nuke
Happy is op as fuck, it kills shit so fast and moving before shit is so helpful. Oh yeah, and that one thing with kel.
Happy and Sad. Happy was for Kel and Kel alone, unless the boss was Angry. And I just found Sad to be overpowered-. Boosted defense, plus, some damage goes to juice rather then heart.
The legend happy with kel nuke
Happy Kel is straight up a nuke
Once you get far in the game, making Aubrey and Kel interact and become enraged is a game changer. Beat down and head butt do a lot of damage. However, defense sucks on anger. Kel nuke is also great.
Happy. Because you can kel nuke
Happy.  Kel.
Happy on omori and friends and angry on enemies. . . I love kel but also just happy strategy works the attack buff enemies get ends up not mattering
I'd make omori pissed and keep Kel happy
I typically would make everyone angry (since their attacks are stronger) or make Kel happy. My strategy was usually have Omori and Aubrey on attack, Kel on items, and Hero on healing
Happy was useful for Kel tho
I salute the Kel nuke so happy
Two words: KEL NUKE
For what I understand Netflix are very likely to, for whatever reason,cancel shows that people really liked after one season to continue to make shows nobody asked for. So I see two possible outcomes:. . 1. Netflix makes one season open for a second one to continue the story but they end up cancelling it so it stays unfinished. . 2. They make one season that contains the full story but after that they make a second season that they show didn’t need and nobody asked for and results being a disaster
I discussed it with my Mexican friend, and we agreed that while the ofrenda was a strong indicator, there was still some doubt, because what kind of self-respecting Mexican family would name their kid "Kel"?
Well to be fair, Kel’s real name is Kelsey but you’re right, at most they would’ve at least named him Carlos or maybe even Juan
Mhm, I think that Kelsey is a 100% English name and does not have an equivalent in Spanish.
*...yeah* lol. . I tried thinking of one. If I found one, I would've said it lol
Idk, I'm Latino and I don't see much resemblance between kel, hero and some Latino, maybe kel's hairy legs
Yea I’m latina too, I can see some resemblance between Kel and Hero (their skin color and hair color which I’m not stereotyping, there’s just a lot of Hispanics with Moreno skin and really dark hair) besides that yea, I just see them as latino because of how they look and stuff
In the end none of that matters because regardless of the original they are still good characters, I just hope that if they are Latino they do not do the classic of Latino = Mexican
Yea especially since most Mexicans in shows or movies they’re stereotyped like a lot. Like there’s so much other Latinos instead of Mexicans tbh
Yes, it seems that they only know Mexico, Brazil and hopefully Argentina for soccer, Latin culture is not as represented as they want to make it seem, well, how are you? 
I’m good, how about you?
Good too, Sorry for not responding 
It’s okay lol
And yea and they stereotype Brazilians too instead of doing actual research on our culture and stuff
Reunión de latinos jaja, de donde son? Yo de Mexico
Chileno de corazón aquí 
Yo soy mexicana pero nací en los estados unidos
Y sabes hablar español fluido? O estás usando traductor? (si te molesta responderme no respondas)
Pues…estoy comunicando contigo en español, no?
Pues podrías estar usando traductor XD, yo la mayoría de veces que hablo aquí me ayudo de un traductor, aunque se suficiente ingles como para entender bien los posts, a veces tengo varios errores cuando escribo sin traductor (aunque el traductor también se equivoca mucho lol)
Pues, no estoy usando un traductor
>kel ends up being the friend of color. . You... please tell me you're joking with this. You *do* know Kel is already a person of color, right?
Yeah I know, which is why I was asking them if they were serious about their complaint about making Kel a poc.
well, he's not poc, just tanned. he's latino, ain't he?
He's either Latino or Hispanic. Either way, he isn't white, which would make him a person of color.

Honestly, it would be quite nice. I could see it running efficiently for 3 seasons. My favorite parts would be Kel just acting goofy. He’d be the biggest comfort character and lighten the mood greatly.
I would love an anime style animated series, I don't think a live-action adaptation could capture the craziness and emotions of Omori. But I also understand that Omori is one of the games that can only be told properly in game format, so it would likely never happen
I’ve had a friend just draw him with Kel’s hair and add the other hair spikes stuff later. It (mostly) worked, talented people do some weird shit (don’t take this as an offense)
Yeah im thinking kel should have asked that and now that I think of her gang would have definitely effected her that way (her being just one step above everyone)
Well do you mean "hates humanity for the wrongdoings it has committed" or "psycho murder demon" kind of a "bad person"? Cause the Fandom predominantly sees Chara as the latter over the former.. . Chara was actually a very kind hearted person towards monsters, but resented humanity for reasons we'll likely never know for sure. They were certainly quite mischievous with Asriel, but they weren't mean. Asriel said that Chara "wasn't the nicest person" never that they were "a **bad** person." . . Asriel follows this up by saying that Chara climbed Mt. Ebot for "not the best reasons" & asks Frisk why *they* made the climb, before deciding it was probably for the best that he *didn't* know. You've also got to remember that not everyone found Asriel back at the beginning, especially considering that's a pretty long trek, so quite a few people never even read any of that dialogue.. . And it's also worth noting that the only actual ***appearance*** Chara makes is at the end of a No Mercy run, to which many people would then go on to wrongly associate Chara with murder & use them as an oh so convenient scapegoat to avoid blaming themselves for killing all of their beloved characters, completely ruining the moral connotations Toby intended.
You're kind of proving my point. Chara doing the killing has nothing to do with the player not being blamed. It's not that hard to comprehend two people being responsible for something, yet somehow people seeing the player as responsible makes them confused about what the characters even are. The idea that people blame chara instead of themself is a fantasy that exists entirely in the mind of people trying to whitewash chara. . . Chara wasn't necessarily as bad when alive, but neither was asriel. This is specifically about their ghost form. And they are connected to the evil ending same as frisk is to good.
Okay, firstly, that's not what Whitewash means bro. Like, *at all.* Secondly, Chara isn't connected to evil. That's the whole point I'm trying to make with this. The only time Chara makes a ***physical, DIRECT appearance*** is the end of a No Mercy run, when Chara takes control of the timeline.. . Chara was ALWAYS with you. They were the narrator giving us a lot of the funny flavor text all throughout every branch of the game, no matter what ending. The amount of EXP & LV you collect at the end of a No Mercy run allows them to manifest a physical form.
The only time frisk identifies themself is at the end of a pacifist route. Do you think they aren't relevant before then, because on the neutral route the game acts like the character is just "you?" The entire point of the route ends is that it reveals who you've been controlling. Frisk can't see you, so they talk to others, but chara can and talks to you and calls you partner.
That's why i'm with kel supremacy. I love the brown titan to make the palid boy to come out and save the day 
Lesser Kel
Nothing is official.. . I think it's likely that either >!she's with Sunny's mom at the new house!< or >!she got sick/injured and had to be put down at some point.!< Hopefully, it's the former. I can't see why his mom would leave a cat with a very depressed and reclusive kid who could barely take care of himself.. . Edit: She could've been also given away to someone else, which I think is also likely. Mewo reminds them too much about Mari so it's very tough for the both of them to be around her.
Kel was on a bulk and needed some protein sooooooo
R Kelly with a full bladder
Well, I think the second is the most likely.
burger king foot lettuce (Kel now has no burgers on his mind)
Im not entirely sure you can. If im correct about a chapter being published in a magazine already, there is probably not a way to read it, and if there is, it won’t be in English most likely
aw, a bummer. But at least it's getting published. Thanks though!
Kel-caine
He just dared Kel to eat a red hot chili pepper.
: STANDING IN LINE TO SEE THE SHOW TONIGHT AND THERE'S A LIGHT ONNNNNNN HEAVY GLOWWWWWW. . : That's not i meant- wait, you know what?. . : By the way, i tried to say I'll be there, waiting for!

He's in love with Kel and isn't too shy to show it
He told kel to go play with ande
Kel simulator
Is it Kel? 
Kel. Everyone's favourite is kel
and since every kel meme is canon, this statement is therefore the canon answer
this is correct
YES, KEL IS SO FUCKING CUTE
definitely kel
kel
Kel, I think its kel
Is it kel...
kel
Kel!
Weird way to say kel
It's kel look at how much merch you have of him. . 
Kel
It must be Kel >:)
HOW DOES KEL LOOK LIKE A GIRL???
Twink = girl that's the rule
most people already got omori bagil and kel so they're getting the less popular ones now
Spoilers: Kel is number 1! Wahoo!
KEL OUR GOAT!!! 
Yes thank you friend!
Is your favorite character kell?
I think this person likes Kel
i only saw kel 3 times
i think your favorite character might be kel
WOAH THATS AWESOME, ANWAY KEL IS BETTER
If I had a nickel for every person I met on Reddit so obsessed with a character that they decorate their entire room to make a full shrine in every wall and people start recognizing who they are and >!joking about how they are a character who should be dead because of the story!< I'd have two nickels but holy shit
. . mine didn’t arrive white but he’s all gleep glorp 😭
Kel the LONG WAY
YOUR       LONG

"Out of the way football head" 😭😭😭

I SAW THIS ON TIKTOK OMG
smush the sides of his head
This is truly the Stewiest Kel I've seen on here.
All of the plushies have gotten worse and worse over the years. Every restock the quality always take a hit, and this is the worst release yet.
Aw this makes me sad since I still haven’t gotten any of the rw plushies :(
i remember reading about someone getting a replacement when their plush was low quality, maybe you could try that?
Nah it grew on me. If I ever want a better one I'll try that tho.
if i had a nickel for every time a relatively large game i enjoy had a whitewashed plushie i'd have at least 30 cents and that's not good
Fellow splatoon fan?
yup. also ensemble stars recently had a plush that whitewashed the one character with any semblance of melanin
Wait who did they whitewash in splatoon?? I’m concerned now I don’t remember anyone being whitewashed
Real
That ain’t Kelsey that’s Chelsey
"No it's not, CHEL! You're a gross color!!!"
It's like she's trapped in some king of... Cakegrave
Not even just the plushies, I feel like Kel and Hero get whiter with each new merch drop. The gummy keychains are a prime example 💀 I hope their birthday art isn't white washed too.
I doubt it will be, their plushies are just a result of merch quality declining with every restock
Kel stop painting yourself white😔
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM 💔💔💔💔💔
Bruh that’s Klein my man, another fake fan spotted
"YOU'RE A GROSS COLOUR"
My boy had to many pizzas💔💔💔
B R O. Look at the difference in quality! Kel's cooked.
You can email customer service, they offered me either a replacement or a refund!
makes me so sad seeing the direction the plushes are taking :( my friend picked one up for me from ax this year and he looks perfect i wish everyone got the same
Who is this white boy
ordered the something plushy and it doesnt even make the noise
Damn💔
Oh god I'm so scared now
dude same rgtioyhutiernkfdlerwgebf v
. . This him or am i tweaking
They shrank his melanin. Made him look soft..
my omori plushie from the last restock is built so weird😭😭
do they not use the same fabric for every kel plush made? why did they use a paler one lolol
It seems he's entered Whitespace.

Damn
oh god my kel plushie's still not yet here im scared that it'll look like shit
Has it arrived?
Every AU Kel ever
Didn't realise there are omori AUs, I'm new to this community lol (just finished the game a couple of days ago)
I’m so sorry
That's very nice of you. I'll think. Cuz for now all I feel is trauma. (Gosh why does this game feel so... real :d)
i think he likes kel guys
The biggest Kel fan
Kel always ends up looking like stewie
I agree, they dont feel the same as my HS Kel I got a while back. Its really a shame, I was looking forward to getting these guys when they re-released, and now that I have them, I'm disappointed.
I also got HS Kel in the most recent restock and the quality was really good (including the fabric). I was expecting the same for this restock so it was a surprise just how bad the quality is. And the fact that we had to wait so long for another restock only for them to look rushed.
Why is Kel PALE 😭
They don't call it WHITE space for nothing.
my sister bought a kel one they’re so cute ahh
I had a hair defect on my kel plushie 🥲 it was on his bangs, looks like a piece was literally just cut off
Honestly, it's beautiful. I envy you, wish I had a Kel collection like this
. . Hkelp my brother just stocked this one on the shelf next to my bed 😭 now I can't look left without getting jumpscared by this
gay?
omg hi kel
omg hi kel
Is it Kel?
***Facepalms…*** . . I need to use that Kel sticker though
Same
kel, duh
Wait, if it's not Kel then who is it
Kel
kel
Kel
omg my keychain adn drawings!!!! theyre real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I trust your collection will grow to be the biggest kel collection ever😋😋😋im not someone to base any goals on but who shares the same interest!!! Even if it isnt Absurdly huge it is lovely and a pefect way to show passion for something regardless of size 🤞🤞Its the enjoyment that counts most to me👏
Thank you so much!! Also when I read the note that came with my order for that alien Kel keychain I almost shed tears of joy realizing you recognized me. :3
i love your kel collection! he's a very silly fellow
uh.... kel?
idk but it can’t be kel that’s for sure 🤔🤔
Oh geez I'm so so jealous. Kel is clearly the best character, but because of that unfortunately his stuff is always sold out :(
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT ALIEN KEL KEYCHAIN I NEED IT AHSFAWOFASGHAIGIAHIF. . . .   . (Also my little brain is very happy that you put all the keychains on the branches)

Thanks bud!
WAIT IT\`S SPINNILEAF!?
Not expecting that one
Is it.. Kel?
Definitely not Kel that much is sure/s. . Also on a side note did you have to place the top of the keychains to the tree branches?!
Everything Kel related, hero? Kel blood related, Sunny, Aubrey, Basil? Kel friend related, something in faraway town? Kel town related.. . I CAN TAKE ANYTHING
kel
Say bye to your omori nendoriod and kel plush
i am strengthening her skeleton ☺️ what doesnt kill you makes u stronger (i am a plush abuser)
7 days and still waiting for my KEl
hope everything goes well

👍
👍
Kel is so nonchalant I love it
Real
Oh why hello 👋. . 
The image took a minute to load so I was just wondering what it could be and I was not disappointed
Kel is the best homie
I love thise sm
That’s sick dude. . 
The smaller the deadlier
I can surely win if I play basketball with the KEL plushie
i will punt you out of that seat kel 
Violence is unnecessary
not when its kel 
Avarage kell
No, seriously


:D

:D
:D
:D

:D
:D
:D
:D
I love the tiny tiny Kel shrine hiding behind that one cutout
i just took all of those pictures down right before reading thisn so i could replace them with more hero😭😭😭poor kel
Hey Kel, check out my new CUT
 Kel would definitely unironically use old memes like "I like your cut g
I like yo cut g. . 
Panchiko reference
thats definetly fair……… I think for me it just looks so weird bc I’m so used to the one I got initially 😅😅😅. I can’t really defend kel at all though . I seriously don’t know what happened w his restock it’s so bad ………
I give the new run a bunch of flack but I do think for the Most part they look pretty decent…. Honestly the main one who genuinely looks bad is Kel
That’s not kel, that’s Klein, common misconception which separates the FAKE FANS from the real ones
Kel lowkey look like a girl 😭🙏, this ain’t kel. Sunny is kinda fine expect the ears
. . my kel also looks like stewie 😭
was kel this pale in game?
no he is not, In the official art and most depictions of him his skin tone is more tan (besides headspace)
i found kel grinning the best. . also i like omor. . also aub is really nice too

Kel, babil and omor
Same, with Kel and Omori love the lil goobers
I think this is totally a kel shelf tour
The plushies didn’t sell out right away most likely because a lot of people already have them, or maybe they just made a lot more than past restocks
you don’t know him? that’s Kevin . he’s always been in the game
Ah damn I knew I should have cleaned my glasses before playing the game
😭😭😭
It’s Klein, fake fan, man this sub is filled with fake fans!1!1!1
I'M SORRY 😭 Klein mischaracterization is real
mine is arriving today and if he looks like that i WILL cry 🙏🙏
I'll cry with you man don't worry, you're not alone in the plushie fear
Bro mine arrives Monday and I’m so scared 😭😭
mine just got here and hes totally fine!! i wouldn’t worry too much :)
Thats good to hear. Pray for me fr
why do they look so weird now? the lack of consistency is odd.
I feel like there's always been manufacturing errors with the plushies. It's just that this time around it's, ah, significantly worse
guess it's best to wait and see if this time it'll get addressed. Have you contacted customer support?
Just sent the email, yes. Now it's the waiting game
hopefully you can get a refund or at least a better quality replacement
😭😭😭 Have you tried squishing his head into shape?
YESSS his head is literally hard as a rock. Plus I checked the photos on the website and I think they just changed how they produce the plushies because the heads are too big for the hair
NONONO- I had the first batch kel and he has the SAME issue. I squished the HeLL out of him and nothing. For the price they have you'd expect better. I did my goddarn best and NOTHING. . . 
I thought the first batch plushes were supposed to be the best quality--- I see so many people with perfect looking Kel's and we're over here looking like a dingo at our baby
this was first batch. I am an adult with disposable money and poor decision making skills so I purchase all sunny-kel stuff whenever it comes out \*and\* I am suffering with Kel. The neck thing seems to be a problem with others too, though!
No same, I've spent so much money on this game it's not even funny! When the restock when live I posted on twitter that I bought all 6 and someone asked how rich is my wallet- had to break it to em I'm an adult with a poor wallet and poor decision making skills. Gave me a good laugh though.
Also an adult. I have ALL the sunkel merch I could get my hands on and whenever anything kel related drops I MUST have it but honestly sometimes quality is... something. I have a mug collection and plenty of enamel ones, I find hilarious that the omori shop one is chipped even if I never really used it :/ The paint is just... what it is.. . 
All omori merch is a must have but ESPECIALLY sunkel for me too, which is painful when you never know what you're gunna get. Luckily my OMORI mugs haven't chipped, although I don't use them so there's that (I store my omori keychains in them-). I have the figure sets and hoo, the quality is kinda shocking. SOMETHING's peg on the stand broke, Mark's stand is slanted so it can't support her big ol' egg head, and Basil and Kel came with scuffs. I have the walkthrough and strategy guide and it came with the side crushed. . . But still, I take the merch risk because I'm too autistic not to 🫡
FELLOW SUNKEL FAN?  10/10 taste over there!  I also don't use anything, really, that's how the mug arrived. I have a sunkel shrine and I'm considering re-purchasing Kel's plushie but MAN I keep seeing him being the one often messed up ç\ç  And OH GOSH. the figure set is the only thing I still miss (I was waiting for Kel to restock in faraway) and... WOW. YEah, I had issues too. For the prices one would expect omocat to be careful about those things.. . Yeah, same. It's insane because I've never been a big collector, I have 2-3 pieces for every big fandom I have, but omori took over.
NO stop living my life 😭 I'm the exact same, OMORI literally took over my life. My friends and I call my collection "The OMORI shrine," and I even have a Mewo tattoo on my wrist XD. . But with the plushies? I'm definitely gunna buy another Kel (I already had to get another Sunny because mine looked like a victim of photoshop) but yeaaahhhh his plush is the single worst victim of manufacturing errors. Which sucks considering the prices. Every single one I've seen has the funkiest shaped head with a forehead big enough to land a plane on.
..... autistic sunkel fans bonding over their shared experience? I know it took over mine in absurd ways, I literally wrote about it for my (healthcare worker) educational credits for work. Sunny and how he represents schizophrenia well (mental illness representation in media). It lives rent free in my head all the time.. .   . Yeah the plushies are... something. I'm planning to eventually get a second kel as well BUT I opted for a Basil this time since I want to work on a mod where kel and basil are basically co-protagonists and I need him to keep myself motivated (Sunny and kel will never leave the shrine, but basil can stare at me from in front of the opc). . Kel plushies just seem to get it worse than others. Even if they don't beat the mari that was delivered with kel's hair. a true legend. . 
I could spend so much on it. For me, it's schizophrenia, so many things line up so well with it and I admit that as healthcare worker specialized in mental illnesses (even if I'm just a nurse) it's just so fascinating for me. Headcanon or not, I'd love to hear about your opinions.. . Honestly, I would love to learn it all? Want to share discord? I should warn you I'm 37 so I want to make sure you're comfortable with it? I'm also writing fics, currently doing some short stuff for the sunkel week.. . She's just cutting her hair like her future brother in law, that's all. But man... head plushie errors are wonderful to witness.
Oh, sure! I'm down to share discords. I'm 26 personally and I'm perfectly comfortable. I'm always down to just blab on and on about this game.
I am currently stepping at work but I'll send you a DM with my discord as soon as I'm back home in around 12. Love this game SO much
ATP op should just consider buying a bootleg plushie because they probably will look better and cheaper ngl 😔
As far as I can see there's only Headspace bootlegs and all my Headspace plushes look fine 😭 It's really only Faraway Kel that's horribly off model for me
I suggest emailing customer service about this, I did the same and they asked for pictures and haven’t replied yet. But I’m sure they’ll do something if everyone has the same complaint 💀
Big brain (like Kel- Klein) if we complain enough surely something will change
I have sent the email, now we wait
Update I got a refund
How long did they take to reply to your email? I sent in one about a missing item from an order, and I don't want to sent another and be shoved to the back of the queue, but I don't know how long I should expect to wait before becoming concerned...
kell😂👌
I know it sounds bad but squish and mold the hell out of his head. He’s a baby so his head is like modeling clay! Just reform his skull!  :D
I think this baby was born with too much modeling clay 😭 extra padding for his brain ig
Bro what brain 🥀

Real

"Kel" is a nickname, and nicknames are for friends. Kelsey Omori is NO friend of mine,
Guys have you ever thought to skin out the fabric of the, Omori plushies and then reshape them to your liking making sure you still use the original stuffing? Just me?
I'm so scared for mine! They're coming soon and I'm horrified! T-T
Damn he gained a lil bit of weight, that chin is crazy
He got a big ol head lol
why did he eated a bees
God.
Kel after taking the hooligans because I refuse to be defeated by mikael
Baldmori, baldro, baldsil, baldbry, Baldkel and Baldari . My favourite characters
baldro? is that a balatro reference?????
..b...baldro?. . 
The meme is misspelled 😭🤣
The plushes have been slowly but surely getting worse with each restock. With the most recent restock, I'm noticing more errors than ever before. Every new Kel plush I see people post looks like Stewie from Family Guy, or Arnold from.. Hey Arnold. And besides the heads being misshapen, the clothes are too small, the hair is sewn on at a weird angle. Honestly if there's another restock, I fear what they'll look like. I wouldn't be surprised if they had an extra arm or something.
10/10 would eat again

He's perfect
orange flavoured burger 🧡
You shall do as an appetizer
but kel isn't here so it's not canon
IVE COME TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT! KEL THE BASKETBALL PLAYER PISSED ON MY FUCKING GIRLFRIEND!
THAT'S RIGHT! HE TOOK HIS WILLY OUT AND HE PISSED ALL OVER MY GIRLFRIEND, AND HE SAID HIS WILLY WAS "This Big!!!"
AND I SAID, "THAT'S DISGUSTING"
r/SuddenlyMoonPissing
Or just have them drown Kel with coffee, give hin chicken balls, then have him do run n' gun
*I'd* like to go on the dark web and look at a picture of a skeleton
Yeah but not that skinny, just compare them to the game versions of them, its much better. (Especially Kel who is supposed to be the sportsy type yet he looks like he only ate once a week for years)
Won't is more likely.
Kel está ahi a sique es canon
# IT’S KELSOME!!!!!!
#IT'S AUBMAZING!!!!!
# IT’S SUNTASTIC!!!!!
#I CAN'T THINK OF ANY!!!!!!!!!!!!
i'm honestly... disappointed. they are drawn like 10 year olds, no? instead of the teenagers that they actually are? don't get me wrong, the art is gorgeous, but they definitely don't look 15. and it's definitely not an artistic stylization, because kel looks appropriate for his age.
Was just about to post this. I'm hoping it would be a temporary thing, but that's unlikely. You need an account to use "Points" and I don't know how much 179 points is worth. Hm.
about 2 usd
For me it says 4usd
Try other cites. I just looked up "omori chapter 4" and every link is free
I definitely bought and paid for chapter 4 like an upstanding citizen, and am not at all looking for another Reddit user to DM me the pages. Not at all. Especially not one by the name of u/KelseyAlvarez. I definitely wouldn't like them to DM me all of the pages, not at all!
Happy kel day
It would have be weird to color HS like that and let the RW in black and white imo. We know that coloring RW is not an option. . . It does look better, don't get me wrong but the sudden change of color would likely bother me while reading.
Glhf coloring RW lol
And because they've chosen a medium that doesn't have color, they've lost a key aspect. Sure it's likely cheaper, but it's a choice they've made not something they had to do, and it's a mistake.
No that's Polly.exe, and if you read a bit farther than you'd see that they actually reveal it by her almost killing Kel but ultimately failing due to Sunny telling Kel to "lock in"
I just realized how tall Kel got
They are most likely rich anyways, since these guys travel all the time.
>Do we hate this frame, or do we love it?. . If by "we" you mean "the vast majority of engagement in this subreddit", then yes, we love it.. . The people who feel offended are in the minority (and because of that, tend to more often than not get downvoted into oblivion).  Fortunately for the majority, because it's official source material, this point of view is much less likely to be catered to.
Freakel

oh mine god it's Ryo Yamada from the popular anime Bocchi the Rock (peak)

Kel. . 
Inb4 kel comes in with the “we are the exception” speech
And then you see kel doing the Todo dance whilst imagining orange Joe….. absolute cinema
Trying to translate only the Kel one because I can't see the others except his and Basil's bio, because of the damn resolution. I don't even know why it's attached to a staircase, maybe it's an advertisement?. . Kel:. A childhood friend of Sunny who is as bright as the sun.. He was a little insensitive when he was younger, but now he seems to have matured a bit.
Grrr🤬🤬🤬. . I mean at least they made kel look kinda adorable
Kel looks like a tomboy lol
I was about to reply with how I just like his massive ahh eyes but then my cat bit me on the neck and I fell out my bed
You're a gross colour, Kel!
"No it's not Kel you're a gross color"
Poor Kel 🤣
Damn, either Kel is fucking 7 feet tall or Polly is a midget.
Kel is canonically 6'3
wait when was that confirmed
there’s like a height chart
Wasn't that fanmade
and that one kel birthday image
Kel does the little link with the K and the e!!! I do the same! It’s so much fun to write stuff like “he” or “ne” without lifting your pen/pencil
Why do i write like kel
Yeah, there’s a Kel one! I was hoping to get kel, but because it’s a fifty fifty chance between getting either of them so it’s random. It’s limited edition with the first print, so the more time passes the rarer it gets! :D
I noticed that they seem to make the antagonistic characters worse, and the ‘good’ characters better, and I’m worried they’re trying to dumb it down a little (so to speak).. . The difference in Aubrey’s insults are IMMENSE for me. In the game she calls Sunny a “psychopath who carries a knife”, which is pretty valid since she had just been stabbed by said knife. . . In the manga she calls him a “loser shut-in”, which feels mean and petty, as if she’s insulting him just for the sake of being awful? Which is not even close to her character.. . Something I noticed when I prodded a little deeper is the manga making Kel actually look better than he did in the game. The Kim scene bugged me a little, not because it fleshed out Kim more, but because the way Kel handled it was much kinder and well thought out than the way he treated the hooligans in the game.. . I love Kel, but I felt the point of the story in the game is that they were all damaged kids, and Kel’s grudge against the hooligans was pretty integral. He was pretty tone deaf, and didn’t understand why they acted the way they did, but in the manga they remove most of that.. . It makes Aubrey’s valid criticism of his actions less so, and it just makes me sad seeing the butchering of every single complex, flawed character I loved in the game.
I actually agree with you on the Kel stuff, even though the reason why I came to that conclusion is quite different.. . I don’t think that the way he handled the Kim-situation was too ooc, simply because the events played out a little differently: in the game, Kim wasn’t being threatened of being put in juvie, and the shopkeeper wasn’t part of this scene at all, so it makes sense for Kel to feel a bit more sympathetic towards her in such an extreme situation. Tho, now that you mention it, I wonder if their goal was that of making Kel look morally better than he is, rather than fleshing her out…. . What felt way too out there for my taste was, in fact, his last remark (paired with the way he ended up defending Aubrey in the church, a thing he never does in canon despite the situation being identical).. . You see, the main point of the Kel-Aubrey conflict was that neither of the two fully got the other’s point of view. Kel quickly came to the conclusion that Aubrey changed and, therefore, they couldn’t be friends anymore. Only after Hero pointed out that she may still be the same person deep inside he started to sympathise with her more.. . I’m not going to judge this part of the writing much since RW!Hero still hasn’t shown up, but I’m under the impression that his character will also suffer because of it, since now his role in the story won’t feel that necessary, given that Kel doesn’t seem to hold that huge of a grudge against Aubrey.
In fact, Kel specifically says he blocked out most of that memory. Things like that do not happen easily, I'd say it's entirely believable Hero could've done something like that.. . In fact, >!people doing something in anger that they regret later!< is one of the major themes of the game, we see that happen to all the main characters, >!even Mari!< who seems even less likely to act like that at first glance.
Does that mean Kel thinks he's Asuka?
I haven’t read most of the recent chapters but I’m pretty sure this is sunny imagining it happening, not what actually happened. That being said, even in the game, Kel said he blocked out most of it. . . While I don’t think Hero would’ve actually choked Kel in this scene, I have always read this incident as Hero getting physical with Kel, specifically pushing him. Mainly because it starts a pattern in Omori of people letting their emotions get the better of them and hurting those closest to them, continues with Aubrey and Basil at the lake before finally paying off with the reveal of the truth
SUNNY is projecting his own trauma "Hands of time will wring my neck" on KEL, I think.. . The creepiest part is how REAL WORLD is creeping into HEADSPACE in the manga.. . OMORI is just *terrified.*
Oh, this little comic is so hilarious and awesome! I like nice little details like patches on Kel's face. Gotta check your profile later for more!
Thank you! 
Im wondering, does she knows Kel has picked up the photo album?
>!No, I’m pretty sure she doesn’t. Kel and Sunny hid from Aubrey before she could see them.!<

in the game she doesn't realize until the last day, either
bro what's with kel's right arm
 I’m not a football player…
Although when looking it up Im realizing that my boy Kel is really fucking tall lmao. . . 
In the photos Sunny is mentioned being the youngest of the group and turned 12, that means all the kids in headspace are 12 and Hero states he’s 15 in headspace and Mari’s very likely as old as him. It’s been mentioned multiple times throughout in the game that Mari passed 4 years ago, but the game takes place in the summer so it hasn’t been a full 5 years (I assume) and it’s very likely takes place in June since Hero’s coming home from college. Hero’s birthday is on January 1st so his birthday passed this year so he’s 20 years, all the younger kids are about 17 since Kel’s birthday’s on November 11th (since Sunny’s the youngest he’s the oldest of the younger kids) so his birthday hasn’t come this year so he’s 17, going to be 18 this year. Basil’s the second oldest of the kids, being born February 18th and Aubrey’s the second youngest, on May 23rd so they’re both 17 and Sunny’s the only one who’s still 16 since his birthday is on July 20th and the game very likely takes place in June and his birthday hasn’t passed yet.
might not be exactly correct but I think this may be sunny's perspective of his thoughts on how much kel has grown >!after not seeing him for 4 years!<

That panel just looks so weird to me, only panel i dont like tbh.
Same, but probably for a different reason, I don’t like Sunny’s posture, his hands are curled up like he’s either being assertive or sheepish, I always saw him reacting to Kel with mild surprise but general apathy.
I think his posture is a result of him "forcing" himself to open the door
I also don’t like the panel of Sunny stumbling after Kel, he looks very out of character in that scene to me
Reminder that the average neigh of the Door frame is 80 inches.. . Kel is 6,7.
To be fair, Sunny is the shortest in the gang (tied with Basil), while Kel is almost a foot taller
I cackled at this post, thank you
its kinda funny how short sun is but again hes been inside for 4 years
Kind of disappointing, the story kinda got ruined and stripped it of what made it good in the first place. I’m glad the pacing was fixed, though.. In terms of the art it’s decent, especially the horror parts which were really cool, but I’m so bugged by how the characters look 12 instead of 16. They also all look really skinny, even Kel, who is definitely not skinny.
Mahoraga when it tries to adapt the kel nuke 
I mean, that's kind of how Sukuna took it out
Something feels wrong in Kel's design.
Ya I agree, it could be the eyes maybe? Idk
The expression. Man looks a bit psychopathic.
Lmao yeah xD that’s not Kel
I feel like the artstyle loses Kel’s roughness, because it’s too polished and neat. . . Kel is often pictured with a goofy, toothy grin (not a pristine and symmetrical smile), he often has rough blush lines and not these very subtle blushed cheeks. . . The artstyle works in favor of someone like Omori or Sunny which are a lot less expressive, so the uncanny symmetry and perfect skin makes them look somewhat creepy (as intended). Kel does look somewhat better in the manga itself though because the style is much rougher, unlike this cover art, though his perfectly shaped and black eyes still seem out of place.
i think his head is too small for his body or his body is too small for his head
The head. Definitely the head.
Why does Kel look like some gyaru is cosplaying as Kel?
Why Kel like that? 💀
yeah that is NOT kel
Bro, why does Kel look like the tomboy girl of my dreams
That's Kel's lost twin . Lek
Hero pushed kel towards the wall when he got angry after Mari's death, and Kel's head banged against the wall and got brain damage 😐😵🤕
I mean, most likely
“Sorry Kel.. But in a few moments your gonna be GOLDENVENGENCED”
. . Why does it look like Hakari Mari is mentally connected to the original universe?. . Just where did she get the Good 16-17 year old Kel look from? or you couldn't come up with a decent design and had to use the Original Kel design?
This is an important part of the story, so it's difficult for me to answer. I'll make sure to release an episode that provides a satisfying explanation 
I just realized that Kel has a TERRIBLE luck in this AU 😞
The appearance of original Kel ’s phantom made me feel a little sad，how cute he was in the past！
Yeah, but on the inside, they all equally suffered as much. . Bagel became a timid boy who got constantly bullied by his former best friend. . Hero became depressed for a year, never getting out, even though he recovered, he still carried the weight. . Kel, is Kel, he's fine. . srsly tho, Kel forced himself to be happy by forcing happiness. . Aubrey got consumed by her rage, not finding fullness in being a bully
Kel very much coped via not letting himself grief/trying his best to get over it and forcing happiness, i am certain after the game he and hero will be able to grieve better together as brothers :]
Equally nahhh... None of them suffered with the guilt of hanging your best friend's sister's corpse and being forced to keep a secret for years so your friend who killed her doesn't get punished 
Kel owns that fit.
i just Know this will get me downvoted but. . kelbrey moment 🫶
The forecast seems to be saying that there are upvotes headed your way 
WOOHOO i just remembered the discourse that happened on the “kelbrey canon” post the other week and was like ohhh shit here we go again time to start ww3 with the sunburn people
lmao fair enough ya never know with this subreddit XDD
OMGMGMMGMG KELBREY MENTIONED OMG
KELBREY!!!
KELBRY MENTIONED >W<
What Kel saw. . 
Is that fucking Jae Heon
Kel vs Goku
This…makes me want to give Kel a big hug…
feel like they both deserve one…
Why is Kel fighting against Goku bro who made this match up 😭💔💔💔
I wanna hug lil kel
His arms and legs are so thin compared to Kel’s 😭. He’s so cute!
OOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH BOY. . WE'RE ON ROUTE TO BLACKSPACE PEOPLE. . LET'S SEE HOW THEY WILL GET ALONG WITH KEL AGAIN IN AT LEAST 3/4 CHAPTERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. . THIS IS GOING AMAZING. . 
It'll definitely be good. 
Not Even needed to Say it. . I KNOW it's gonna be good
...I were making a refference to JJK (The GIF in the message is the refference in question).. . But good to know you want to pull this to the very end, it's inspiring to see how much effort you want to put on this work. But don't drag yourself all the way to the end, people love it regardless.. . Btw, I just love how you did Kel here. Instead of being the goofball we all know, he becomes this idiotic brat, which gaslighted himself to believe that he had suffered alone. He's much like Aubrey, but worse. He mistreats his "new friends", which clearly are afraid of him, because he's not afraid of hurting anyone. Feels like a playback to The Boss, the first Boss Fight in the original game. I'd love to see a 1V1 between Hakari's Kel and Omori's Aubrey (powerscaling!?!?!).. . Aubrey, in contrast, is actually more rational than the original Kel, once again showing that they'd be completely different, other than the fact their goal is to help the protagonist to get over their traumas. Unlike the original Kel, she appears to have gaven up on saving him, as he's lost case to her eyes.. . But I do have some critics over the rest of the gang.. . Mari here feels a little too rag dolled, something that would appeal more to Sunny's side than to hers. Hero on the other hand, he doesn't even try anymore, which feels like that the bit of essence on both characters are gone. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but if it is, I understand why'd you so: to show much time corroeded the both of'em.. . Now, for the last integrant: Bagel, Brazil, Babylon, Spice used to enhance food: Basil. I don't think that he should take Hero's role by 100%. Sure, we don't really know how he was before, but it feels like he lost a tad of his character here. I'm not saying he should be more insecure and clumsy, but it's interesting to see how he has growed that much: not being as i secure, losing hid fear etc.. . But I still believe he needs to lose a bit of the Hero energy and gain more of his original character in, as I believe this contrast between the originals and the swaps that take the other character's role are the one thing that makes this so special, other than your exceptional work and (not talent) acquired skill over the reccuring years of your life.. . Again, this is not meant to be a hate letter or something, I just genuinely LOVE this work, and I want to see it age like fine wine by the end. Take your time, and don't let that become your "magnum opus" or whatever. You'll never have one, as for each and everyday, you keep replacing your magnum opus for another piece of work you've done.. . Be proud Big Relative, you are strong.. . 
By goofball I meant the way both of the characters coped and decided to act regarding their old friends ^
Thank you so much for your detailed feedback. It really means a lot to me. Honestly, I have so much I want to say in response, but as a creator, I believe it's better to speak through my work rather than words. That said, as someone who tends to talk a lot, holding back is not exactly easy for me! 😅. . Let me just say this: I approach this story as TaleWalker, not just as an Omori fan. I’ve analyzed the original work and built my story on its foundations. I wanted to create something that felt like it could truly exist within the world of Omori—a story that I thought would be exciting and meaningful. My aim is to craft this as though it were an official spin-off.. . Of course, I understand that my interpretation might not satisfy everyone. When the full story is revealed, there may be people who don’t agree with my direction or who think poorly of me as a creator. I can’t predict how everyone will feel, but hearing your thoughts gives me hope that such concerns might not be as common as I fear.. . I’ll continue to do my best with the energy and passion I have. Thank you again for your thoughtful and kind words—they truly mean a lot to me. . . **PS:** Big\Relative is actually a random username Reddit assigned to me. I had no idea when I created this account two years ago that it would stick forever 😭. If it’s not too much trouble, I’d appreciate it if you could think of me as *jonggoon*—or TaleWalker if the first name is tricky to pronounce. Thank you so much!
I mean, I can certainly understand why people dont like it, especially the first chapter which is indeed fast paced (although its most likely to serve as a good hook). I do agree though, it may get better for them as time goes on, and I enjoyed reading it so farmyself
Yeah the first chapter had a few issues, but I’m excited for the next chapters!!!  Hopefully they’re like the second one and decently paced.
yeah imo the second chapter was amazing
Sunny: "Are you kel because you're happy or are you happy because you're Kel"
He’d kel
Oh god they all have kel's face 
All good until Kel launches his nuke and blows up the con
I mean the ow character’s clothes are pretty normal like kel is wearing an orange shrt and shorts and thats it
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND  i have very little as far as hips go so things kinda just…slide down if they don’t fit my waist lol i likely have similar issues to you! 
Yeah... And dresses are even worse cuz we guys have big chests so sometimes although the skirt part fits fine, the top doesn't... But thankfully at least L sizing work for me, or XL when it's Asian sizing, so it's fine! But anyway, I think this fit looks great on ya and I would love to try it myself actually... 🥹
u/TheRWKel. . u/KelKelKelKelKelKel1. . more kel

(am i missing a reference here)
Yes
(pretend like this comment is a reference to what i missed)
he thinks you're Kel?
I'm going to make a guess and say they called you Kel due to your skin color.
they've inspired me to cosplay kel next  i could never be offended by being called kel!!
awesome :) don't forget to post it when you do 
i dont remember kel being black
yea me neither but hey it's whatever 🤷🏾‍♀️ actually to my knowledge there are no black characters in omori at all so idrk what this person was talking about.

Is it just me or is Kel smiling like a psychopath in this
:D
If you look on the right-bottom of the picture you can spot a pixel of kel, which means it's canon.
From Aubrey to Kel
from disaster to disaster
From mean disaster, to lovable, chaotic, gremlin type disaster!
[This, but in reverse.]()
Aubrey and Kel became ENRAGED
Nice job changing gender (don’t try it at home kids)
too late i've already transcended reality (and gender)
Actually do try it at home if it makes you happy, kids.
KEL is real
. . Great cosplay💞
Uhm nice cosplay (*'-')b
Maou! Great to see you again!! Another excellent cosplay, it’s miraculous how your characters can look so pretty both on the page and in cosplay!
You’re so pretty Omg. That’s actually so cute
Nice 
the kellening has begun
honestly I kinda want you to teach me more about how to do makeup for cosplays (cuz i'm really bad at it xd). . also really excellent cosplay!! :0
THE CONTOURING THO 😩👌
I get gender envy from you and I'm cis afab lol. Great cosplay! What are your pronouns btw?
She / they :) I'm cis but I really enjoy the "gender swap" when I cosplay a male or non binary character
Yeah I get that, it's hard being a woman so being a man from time to time is a nice change of pace. Stay safe on the internet (from one minor to another) and keep doing your art, you're quite the talent :)
Lesgo!!! 
Kel 
Beautiful kel cosplay 
Impressive makeup skills!
OMGGG HOW CUTE!!!!
Don't read my soul please 
At first I thought you would literally just change the clothing and omg that would've been so funny 
OMG kel doll
Where did you get the life size Kel plushie???
My grandma made it
Now there's two KELs! 
I'm jealous of you
:0 ?
Kel

You forgot the rock.
I love making kel and aubrey mad so I got two agitated little psychos dissing out mean damage.
You’re the perfect fit for aubs, you should do her next frfr
Already did once, but I'll make a new one soon. . . . :3
If aubrey became kel doesnt that mean sunny is gay?
The kel plush:
great cosplay! BTW WHERE DID YOU GET THE KEL REAL SIZE PLUSHIE
My grandma made it :3
OMGG COOL!
Cool cosplay! 
No no don't pretend you aren't questioning it too, why does she have a Kel body pillow?
It's not a body pillow it's a giant plush, and my grandma made it as a surprise for me because she enjoyed my drawings of Kel and often makes plushies
Kel ISNT white
U want me to blackwash myself ?

You are an Orange Joe addiction away from Kel
I guess it's true lmao
I have become Kelbrey 
The size of Kel and the aggression of Aubrey, if they combine we'd be all dead
Don't lie to me. . I know you are the real Kel,this is no cosplay
... How did you guess it 
You have burgers on your mind
You nailed it! The third picture looks especially great. . . But I have to ask if the middle bang is itchy?? Hopefully it’s more comfortable than it looks
Aaaaa thank you so much! :D. . Honestly it's alright, I feel comfortable with the whole cosplay, the wig isn't that itchy 👌
Well every kel meme is canon so I guess you're officially part of omori. . Live action omori when
Ty !. . Well why not lol ( Tbh, I mainly imagine a 2D animation movie / serie of Omori ;w; )
I'm sorry, but.... . "Welcome to your final test, I'm Mr. Beast"
“We can scrap the ‘S’, cuz I’ve never missed a beat”
Wow, neat!. . . Now drink a year expired orange joe.
correction: 5 years expired orange joe
IT STILL ORANGE JOE
Thanks !!  . . . Expired orange joe still orange joe, so... (:

"Corporate needs you to find the difference between this picture (this post) and this picture (Kel)". . "They're the same picture."
kel ur supposed to be in a video game not in the real life ?? wtf (very good cosplay)
If you pull up to the live-action adaption auditions in 8 years like that you got the part. You really nailed it.
Bro even got the barely mustache and hairy legs.... . you sure you ain't kel?
This MIGHT be Kel irl guys
Oh, look, it's Kel! I wonder where the cosplayer is though
BRO, YOU ARE KEL HIMSELF, YOU EVEN OWN THE CACTI LEGS.
I think at this point it's my job to jokingly roast every cosplay, anyways.. . Ya look like the mr.beast clone meme. . (I am joking this is a joke im only here for the funsies and i do not intend to hurt you with my words)
No worries lol, however I don't have the reference of this youtuber, could you tell me about it ? 😅 (I'm not native English and I don't use to watch English speaking youtubers 😅) i wanna laugh too pls 
. . That's the meme i was talking about. And dont worry about your english, everyone was there at some point. As long as you improve it you're doing well . . Edit: wow thanks reddit. . Edit 2: nvm it fixed it
Omg you look so convincing! Def Kel irl
Aaaa thanks so much !
K-KEL?! IS THAT YOU!? W-WHY WOULD YOU COSPLAY YOURSELF!? /pos
Two things to do to become the Kel. . - Make Orange Joe with a carbonation machine. - Harass an Aubrey with your basketball

HOLY SHIT IT'S KEL
Probably the best Omori cosplay I’ve seen LMAO
Very very good Kel! . . I hope this is considered a compliment because I absolutely mean it as such, but the post right before this was from a grappler Baki sub and my immediate thought was “oh shit that’s a pretty good Baki cosplay”
KELMERICA!
irl kel
is the kel in the first pic single
you sorta look how sammy classic sonic fan looks nowadays
Biblically accurate Kel
surprisingly this is the first kel cosplay ive ever seen 😭😭. . HOPE AX WAS FUN SO SAD I DIDNT GET TO GO 😭
OMG i thought this was Ai generated at first glance
This is perfect . Nothing will ever top this
Kel my beloved
Kel best character 😁
Amazing Kel lol
Ok, yeah.  Literally Kel.
the aubs don't deserve this. . (and im saying that as kel)
Yes! It’s shown in >!sunny route one day before hero comes!< also, Kel’s real name is Kelsey I remember a demo, maybe the 2018 one? Having his name as that.
I use pink fluff of fury. . She is super affective against kel types
Kel uses hyperactivity to annoy Aubrey.. It’s effective! too effective.. Kel dies

No offense, but leg hair is so accurate😭
HAHAHA THX I HAD THAT IN MIND. In fact, I plan on shaving my arms (they also have tons of hair) so it's ✨perfect✨
You hide them well, I only noticed and still great cosplay Hairy legs
heheh Yayy thx, I'm excited, people like my cosplay
Pretty cool. 
Omg I love your flair! 
Completely off-topic lol
It’s okay lol. There’s a post from a mod where you can have a somewhat custom flair if you ask. Idk if you’ve seen it yet
Oh, I have seen it lol. Thank you though :)
Np. 
THANKS AAAAAA <3
HELL YEAH 
🏀❤️
oh shit looks like it is easy to get kels shirt 😭(i need to know how so i can make fa aubreys jacket ). . very accurate kel (its amazing), just please dont drink the 5 (iirc (if i remember correctly)) year old orange joe again . . also give aubrey back her dollar 
yeah, thats what im gonna do, go to a salon or something close to that to get my hair dyed, itll take longer because i have dark brown hair which means i have to bleach it before dying it pink im pretty confident with how itll work, because i imagined myself with it and i actually look pretty good  yeah hopefully, itd be a bit of a shame if you didnt  . . kel thats gross the orange joe is still 5 years old  (im gonna do that too when im able to visit my friends in the summer, its one of the first things we're gonna do (and ill also post it on reddit about our experience)). . go walk around faraway town and hopefully youre lucky enough to see a dollar on the ground 
If I may advice, I once dyed my hair greenish blue, also needing to bleach it (the hair of the cosplay is my natural one). It struggled to last one summer, but the discolored lasted quite longer, so buy pink tint to dye it again every now and then (You surely already know about all of this but just in case). . I WOULD NEVER THROW AWAY GOOD FOOD!!!!!!!!. . May god listen to you🥺
ooh okay, i didnt know about that because this (will be) my first time permanently dying my hair, but not dying my hair itself because ive dyed it like 3 or 4 times with washable dye. . i hope youll be able to say that as confident if you get food poisoning, kel  . . yes because then youd be able to give aubrey back the dollar after so long 
Good luck then, I hope ya the best. . IT'S NOT POISON, POLICES SHE'S DISTURBING ME, ORANGE JOE IS HEAVEN'S NECTAR IT'S NOT POISONNN . . Oh! Yeah, that, I almost forgo- I'll look forward to it
thanks  hopefully it goes well for me too. . KEL THE ORANGE JOE IS 5 YEARS OLD AND NO ONE DRINKS THAT CRAP ANYMORE YOURE WEIRD FOR DRINKING 5 YEAR OLD ORANGE JOE *5  YEAR  OLD*  youll die if you drink more 5 year old orange joe . . she needs that dollar back 
Oh c'mon!! I know what can change your opinion... You're just jealous!! Look, I got another Orange Joe for you! Go, take it, it won't bite, don't be shy.. . and I need a pet rock, it's like a... Pyramid or something, I gotta get first what is more important. And a pet rock is clearly better than that pink haired girl friendship... She'll understand!! She's polite and wouldn't ever hurt a butterfly
kel i am not drinking a 5 year old drink . . but you dont know how poor aubrey is 😔 she could be broke and youre over here spending your money on pet rocks   come on kel, its just a dollar
It's a gift!! You can't say no to a gift!! I'd be very very very very sad if you don't drink it🥺🥺🥺. . A dollar won't make her rich!! When someone lends money, they gotta understand they may not see it in some time, it's just natural!! And, the more I think about it, the funnier pet rocks seem
i dont feel like dying slowly from drinking an expired drink  thats just not a fun way to die. . kel *you* took the dollar from her without her consent cause she wouldnt buy orange joe at the vending machine 😭 also its so easy to make pet rocks that you dont even need to buy one 
It IS a fun way to die!. . No! They're exclusive! Attemping to make one would be like making a kid without parents, it just makes no sense!! Stop fooling me😭
having painful stomach cramps isnt fun 😭. . just make two bigger rocks and thatll be their parents  you dont always have to buy pet rocks when you can just search for some in the grass
You fool; me smart!. . You're saying nonsense!! Hector, don't listen to this soulless being 
ok then buddy why dont you drink a whole gallon of expired orange joe then come back and tell me that with a straight face. . hector doesnt have ears, he cant hear us anyway 
Kel drip once more.
HAHAHA frfr 
Let's go
YEAH LET'S GO
Amazing cosplay! Quick question: Did you draw ORANGE JOE?  If so, it looks really well made!
Yes and no. It's drawn, but it's a birthday gift I got (and I LOVE IT) It's maybe not expensive but it's my favourite birthday gift bc it's handmade!! I'll tell my friend that Reddit also likes it
Cool! Definitely tell your friend!
I'll
So accurate you even got the tree trunks he calls legs right! . . Seriously, you nailed it perfectly! You're a spitting image of the Kel!
HAHAHAHAHAHA THX SO MUCH BRO I'M KEL IRL 🥺 LOL (Lots of Love). . *TREE TRUNKS* HAHAHAHAHSSHEHAHZKDFNTKRJ 
I don’t see how anyone could have a bad opinion against your cosplay It’s absolutely amazing!!! 
Idk, maybe arms' hair, or that I didn't get the haircut, or that I got no muscles, or my skin tone! It could be anything tbh. Thanks for the support bro, it means a lot
Okayyy, well, what can you really do about your skin tone  Also I don’t think anyone would expect you to get a haircut for a cosplay!  (Hopefully ;-;)
but maybe a wig instead of just goin' out there with my hair
You say "hardest part of any cosplay", as in general, so I didn't clearly understand if mine doesn't fits. Anyways, I'm noting this down, thx! I also take the grade
I get your point, alr. I mean, it's totally logical
I love the soda can
thankssssss🥹🥹 It's a gift, I also love it
✨ THE MAVERICK:✨ It's my NEMESIS KEL!. . Great job by the way. A few questions.. . 1: How long did it take to make?. . 2: Was there any big struggle or mistakes?. . 3: Where did you get an orange tank top from since that's a very rare color?
My man 🗣🔥🧨
 thx bro 🗣️🔥
KEL IS MY FAVORITE OMG
HE IS MY FAVORITE TOO  (Who could tell 🤭)
Already really accurate but I think some slightly shorter shorts would be even better
Oh, thx, and I'm noting that down!! I won't remake it but I may pull up them a little more next time I wear it
Yeah, it's not worth the effort of remaking the shorts since they're already good, but it's just worth mentioning that Kel's shorts go above the knee. Anyways, good luck with your cosplays!
Of course it's worth mentioning, and I'll try to have them higher!! Have a nice day 


ur so cool
ty so much I'm sure ur also very cool 😎🏀
Dude that’s so good my first instinctual reaction was “oh shit that’s LITERALLY KEL” 😂🫶🫶👏👏🤩
OHHHHH THAT'S WHOLESOME I LOVE THAT!! HAHAHAHAHA. I'm proud of my cosplay then😌
OHHHHH THAT'S WHOLESOME I LOVE THAT!! HAHAHAHAHA. I'm proud of my cosplay then😌
I LOVE THE COSPLAY! Just a couple questions though. Is there a reason you decided to do a cosplay? Like a con or something?  Where did you get those clothes? Or did you make them? How did you get or make that orange joe can? And is that REAL orange joe your drinking?
HAHA TY FOR LOVING MY COSPLAY!!  . . Ok, so I had a cosplay of the employee, from Lethal Company, however, it's really uncomfy. I played OMORI this summer and loved KEL, and a friend of mine said I looked like him so I've been looking forward to cosplay him since then. I'm going to the FicZone in Granada, Spain, so I finally decided to make the cosplay 2 weeks ago, it was my  chance! And I love it 'cuz it's like wearing sleep clothes!! I bought the shoes at Shein (I needed to ask Reddit about how to search for them) and the clothes and ball at Decathlon. However, I had to stitch the details myself, I just bought them plain orange. The orange joe can is a birthday gift I got and I love, it's a painted Pepsi, totally handmade, and I love my friend bc of this. It's not the "real" Orange Joe, it's actually empty (the real orange joe is orange juice + coffee) HOWEVER! I wanna try the real Orange Joe and tell you guys about the experience.
Not expecting a reply this early- But good to know!
HAHA oops- sorry? 
Dont be sorry!
Okay! I'm not sorry anymore! 
I wondering how did you get Kel’s costume?
Hi there! Ty for the interest, you're not the first one asking this, but here we go again!. . - Basket clothes: Decathlon, I bought them plain orange and then stitched the details. I also ordered the ball there. . - I couldn't find the trainers so I asked Reddit, they suggested me "Nike Campus", I got a cheap unbranded version on Shein. . - The can is hand-made, painted. It's, in fact, a birthday gift
Ty! 
I love it when people who legit look like the characters cosplay them
HAHA OMG ILY THX
cosplay?? bro thats just kel but a real person
HAHAHA THAT'S RIGHT! Every Kel meme is canon Kel is in real life REAL LIFE IS CANON!!! 
omori movie cast:. . Kel as the OP of this post. . the rest of the cast is all jack blacks voiced by chris pratt
OMG OMG OMG OMG YES I WANNA BE KEL!! . . *WDYM EVERYONE IS JACK BLACK* 
when I flex, I feel my best 

If you want to check out more photos and a funny video of kel please check out my Ig! . .

Every time I see kel , I see the square thingy in his shirt and I keep thinking it's the rec room logo 😭

I made it from scratch!
Oh, awesome!

Joe Hawley
Legs are smooth 0/10 cosplay
Twink genes smh, no hairy baller kel genes
I don't fw this cosplay(its really cool but no hairy legs)
You look like the much cooler version of Dream. Also great cosplay
It's not a true kel cospkay without the leg hairs
Kel seems to be in love with orange 🍊
Omori movie Kel be like:. . Nice cosplay by the way.
Holy shit, Joe Hawley
Very good very orange
Good effort, but you're not an ugly color. 😆
Next cosplay joe hawley..
Kel but he is white:
Me when  cosplay but  skin tone is wrong according to people shoulda changed my melanin
YOU SHOULD CHANGE YOUR MELANIN NOW!! 

I remember this character, she enables Kel nuke
Oh ye I forgot to say but nice cosplay 
Hahahaha that’s true!
Bro just chilling meanwhile Kel nukes the whole town 💀
why didint kel take away your knife. . nice cosplay!
Thanks!  my little brother is making a cosplay for Kel so he can take it from me when his is done lol
You all did a great job! I think I've seen the same Kel on this subreddit before, it's cool that all of you did this!
Aww thank you so much ! And yeah, we're friends and he's the one who made me discover Omori so we both decided to cosplay as these characters and ended up finding some more cosplayers !🥰
I hope you find Kel so he can beat your ass
that Kel cosplay is pretty much perfect
KEL MY MANNNN ✨😭😭😭
this is what convinces me kel would look good with curly hair 
Rabbits live for 5-10 years. Its pretty likely that Aubs has said at one point “oh yeah i have a pet bunny named bun bun” before
> but I also feel like the devs were just lazy to make another bed sprite. . more likely option
No but that could easily be just a lucky guess (more likely because the devs couldn’t waste time making a separate bed just for that reason because the game was already delayed when it was in development).. . But also even if he did see it that doesn’t mean that sunny was the only one she allowed in her home. We don’t see Basil’s perspective here but he’s way more likely to have gone into her room too since they canonically hung out together at points in the past. . . She likely never let Kel or Hero go in because Kel might tease her about it since he’s childish and wouldn’t understand the seriousness of her situation as a child, and probably doesn’t want Hero to think less of her due to him being so perfect in comparison. Could also just not have let Hero in because that would mean Kel would have to come in too.
Pronounced B/ah/sil too, most likely
That's correct spelling tho
yeah, British
>the guy literally snapped at his younger brother for just mentioning her name. . Which happened 3 years ago while he was in serious depression.  . . . >the fact that he's crying everytime she's mentioned doesn't help either. . Crying every time she's mentioned? I remember him crying at the piano and honestly it's understandable, he needs to let out his emotions in private. It's much better than just bottling them and lashing out like he already did once at Kel, so I'd say that he can control his emotions.  . . . >the lake incident too. . While Aubrey was bullying Basil, we've never seen a single thought of regret until she told everyone the reason why she was bullying him. She lacks the critical thinking which she would need to understand that she almost did the same thing as Sunny. She would probably need Hero or Kel to point it out to her and even then she would have conflicting feelings.
Kel literally got his entire social life ruined because of Sunny, and his brother also entered a deep depression because of it, it also made Basil get bullied, and Aubrey to become gangsta, so i dont think Kel would forgive that easily
I believe Hero is more forgiving than either Kel and Aubrey, since he is an altruist at heart and would rather go away than hurt someone. The only instance were he was mean was when he really was super depressed and even then, he immediately apologized to Kel a tons of times already and he probably feels still remorse for it.. . I also say this because I am tired of fans depicting him as this hyper-masculine macho who would rip Sunny's anus apart. If he was like that, he would have never made friends with the group at all and Mari would have a terrible taste for men.. . Anyway, I think this list is great and better than most, though I still fear for Basil's mental health, since he has a tendency for delusions. I am hopeful that the good ending fixed that problem mostly, coupled with therapy sessions of course, because Therapy is marriage-material according to the Fandom 
Most likely
"No, it's not, KEL! You're a gross color!"
I forgor 💀
racism
Considering the stress he was in its likely he probably considered suicide even after the ending
If you don't open the door for kel, you will be greeted with the Hikikomori route, where you don't go outside and there will be new content in Headspace (and Black Space, which is where the Red Maze is located).. . There's also a way to reach the Red Maze in the true route, but it's very complex and you won't have acess to some of the other Black Space new content.
Oh this is perfect i am doing the hikikomori route rn
Go on, you won't regret it :). . Also, there's even more new stuff if you're playing the console version :v
:00 thanks
>Hikimori. . Hikikomori*
Oh, srry, my bad 
It's okay. 
He'd call ICE on Kel
>  you called ICE on KEL!. . > A giant ice cube came and beat up Kel. . > You dont know what you were expecting
That… sounds like what would happen in HEADSPACE.
First, Ice Cube gets main role in shitty War of Worlds adaptation, now he's beating Kel. Dude fell off.
Canon.
If diavolo also dies it is
I would feel mildly offended if i was Kel, but the good part is... Im not Mexican! Im Argentinian! ...Wich is worse
HE WHITEWASHED KEL
gave him the Michael Jackson treatment 😢
Kel was a gross color anyways
ok trump
I meant skeleton. Woops
Just Kel 
 Shut up Kel. . Just Aubrey 
 Kel
You are gross color Kel.
R a c i s m
Y e s ?
You are gross color Kel
u/chairfucker5 would totally say this
NOOOO YOU MADE KEL SAD 
IF IT MAKES IT ANY BETTER I GOT REALLY SAD. The friends I streamed it to can confirm
Ok, you are forgiven 
Don't worry about it man, I for example like Kelbrey but I know their relationship isn't the most healthy in RW (although I think that most of the characters these two are the best with each other, the only other duo that would surpass them in terms of healthiness would be Sunny and Kel, not counting Hero and Kel since they are bros. Kel and Aubrey always bickered and teased the other, so they had the confidence enough to do so and I think thanks to that they ended up as friends again faster than some of the others). . So don't worry about hypocritical man, every single ship has its flaws and 99.99% of them wouldn't be possible without some therapy lol
I absolutely agree. Also what are you on to type that fast my comment was just a minute ago.
Idk, i just guess I'm pretty fast. . Or maybe I'm just build different lol  but nah, it's just that I happen to be checking some things and I just saw your comment lol
He ditches the hide and seek game to train with Shaun & Ren and real world >!generally did better than Kel (e.g. beat him in arm-wrestling) and has the stamina to save Basil in the lake!< so I think dislike is a warped perception  - Kel is the sporty one so Hero can't be athletic in Headspace? I wanna say messy hair is just natural after a sleepover for a boy lol
Oh the only time I’m involved here is when the sub pops up on my feed, I’m honestly not that deep into the fandom so some stuff pops up that confuses me (like the every Kel meme is canon, when that first popped up I was confuse af). Using the block feature is smart, I usually forget it exists-. . Yeah, honestly I don’t get why there is shipping involved in a game that is about mental issues but I’m not about to gatekeep that just because of the games seriousness, the fandom just likes to joke around so not about to attack that I honestly want to protect and savour that part
Yeah I have to say while they like their shipping I haven't seen any wars yet which is my biggest issue with shipping. So it's definitely a good track so far I've seen 👍
Yeah, that’s a good part of the shipping part of the fandom, they don’t fight over which ship is better or more canon
I'm totally cool with him making theories. As long as he doesn't half-ass them. Hollow Knight, Kirby, the goddamn sans is ness; all theories that are so incredibly ridiculous, it feels he intentionally made them impossibly impossible. If he takes the time to actually read things, then he's perfectly free to make his funny little theories. But if he somehow comes to the conclusion that Kel is actually a murdering Psychopath just because he likes Orange Joe, that's a little too ignorant.
If you take his insane theories too seriously you’re honestly missing the point. . . Sans is ness was never supposed to be true, it was just an absurd thought he decided to try to make a connection for and it got ridiculously out of hand.. . . The hollow night and kirby theories were bad but that’s literally two examples, he’s been doing this for years of course he’ll slip up.
Some thoughts just should not be shared.
That's why he's says "but that's just a theory" at the end.
Yes and to prove this more Kel is in the picture
Kel is canon
Impossible, that’s the least likely canon ship
Damn u down d stairs
My mortal enemy must be defeated. . Wait brb
Well Kel is there so obviously
Kel is just like me fr
I think they would be about even but I do think Kel is slightly stronger
Kel is a maniac
All kel memes are canon 
Oh shi-
Kel just peels lemons and eats them like a fkin orange for breakfast
Kel is autistic. . Charleen is trans mtf
I think Kel is more ADHD
Nothing kel does is canon...which makes this canon, fuck.
Kel is actually really smart
kel eats plastic. fine dining if i do say so myself
kel is trans (FTM)
Kelsey
Sorry already sold my soul to kel but i do got flowers
That will do
i love how matt acknowdleges the memes and how his theory sounded farfetched and multiple other characters could be them
But now his theory isnt farfetched and is officially cannon
I wouldn’t say official but it’s a possibility
.....but there was Kel......
Oh shoot… your right
But-. All Kel memes are canon!
Did MatPat finish OMORI? Did he say?
No. He got to the prologue starting 🤨. He played it on his GTLive channel you can go look it up
Thank You for replying, yes, I saw it, I'm just wondering if he said he finished on Twitter or any other social media, but couldn't broadcast it because it was too dark for his viewers, but yeah, Thanks for replying!
He stopped because he got bullied out of it by the omori fandom not because of how dark it was unfortunately
It isn't that farfetched. His appearance isn't the only thing he used he used many other lore pieces and his appearance is just the little detail to make it click. Even the colors are the same 😱
Remind me why people hate matpat? Is it really that bad of a youtuber?
He's just way past his golden age that people remember him for, and it's really noticeable. He changed with the times like so many others in order to keep going in the changing place that was youtube around 2015, and he's succeeded. It's partially because today he's nothing like what his previous generation of audience that watched him when they were teenagers remember him as.
Although I would agree with you, his target audience is very young (which he builds it like that through his videos), he knows it himself that his audience is extremely young by the fact that over the years he dumbed down his videos a bit. Yes, it is the parents job to monitor their children, but it is also matpat's job to recognize what he should show his viewers and what he shouldn't. Kids will watch even if their is warnings because they want to become mature and parents recognize him as the youtuber who explains big stuff to kids in a way they can understand, so they would most likely ignore it thinking that he is going to explain a video, not play a game made for mature audiences.
tbh his theories isn’t the best
He's not bad, he just changed with the times.  His videos absolutely have polish and effort put into them, but the exact content he puts out isn't what he used to make and people are upset he's not catering to them.. . He's also a bit of a geek.
Gregory is nft sexual is canon now then
I misread the title as ‘kel was a game theory kid’
Okay, but what actually cracked me up is that Dream from that MV is in that pic 😭 MatPat, why ?
Guessing it probably wasn't him tbh. . Probably his editors chose the images from twitter or something
what if  .   . what if Kel is Ness 😳
I wasn’t aware that there were many people that don’t like mat. I personally really enjoy his food and game theory videos c:
we are close to a game theory about omori
probably not since matpat already tried playing omori on stream but got hated on and stopped, so probably not
he said he finished it so..
Kel, do you see that vent on the floor
Welp. It’s canon now.
oh boy here we go again
I didn't know so many people disliked Matpat. I actually really like his theorys, their fun and don't take themselves to seriously
People still watch this guy?
nah those 4,5 mil views are imaginary
A L L . . K E L . . M E M E S . . A R E . . C A N O N .
Remember, every Kel meme is canon!
A war was created in the replies lol
This is true, but it's also established that Sunny is too afraid to look out the window or go outside, meaning it's very unlikely that he would have witnessed the tree being cut down and be told "You are not my son" by his father in that exact circumstance. It's more likely that the image is constructed, having heard his father cut the tree from his mother, with his own guilt attached.
Thank you for the insights!. I would really love to have a forensic person comment on the matter. Like would there be an autopsy? Would they find something (most certainly)? What would be the most likely version of the act in general (her being already dead or still alive after the fall) etc.
I feel like Kel and a dead child are the most reasonable answers
The dead child was the one who lead the mafia 
Kel 
Holy there is kel that means it's canon
Oh Fuck, Kel is in the picture!
shoulder length brown hair + orange clothing = kel. shoulder length brown hair + orange clothing + boobs = female kel
We've figured out the formula!
its also related to caffine, like orange joe so likeeee
you've heard of pink hair = aubrey now get ready for orange clothes = kel
Oh god, the orange is oj + coffee, so caffeine. . #IT'S ALL CONNECTED
I'm surprised no one's made an Orange Joe joke yet.. . Edit: There we go.
Orange joe mama. . . . Are you happy now?
An "Orange Joeke"?

Cease thou heresy
Damn, I sincerly thought it was a femkel art before reading the title.
“Theory”
:)
Got ketchup mixed with lettuce cheese
Cuz every time I wake up in the morning i got burgers on my mind 
plot twist: kelsey is caffeine girl
Do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp do not simp
Nah i wont simp, goodbye
Stay strong soldier
i would only simp for kel
Simping for Kel and Sweetheart clones is acceptable  . Edit: Why are you booing me, I'm right
The good ending
That is literally Kelsey lmfao
. . Nah I’m simpin
&#x200B;. . . . me when i read that comment
orange joe
That was unexpected
Because Kel is too fast to be restricted to only Omori.
just KEL is all over the place
Me when women exist
Orange Joe is caffeine after all
Kelsey, but more booba
Seems like the usual amount of booba for Kelsey. The clothing makes it seem bigger.
Female Kel’s alter ego, ORANGE JOE. 
hot
Damnnnn those boobies tho

Sus
Definitely sus
Mhm, most certainly sus
Truly the sussiest of the sus
A genuine sussy baka
A sussy little sus impostor
A smol little venting sus connoisseur
A tiny bit unusual impersonator
A slightly unorthodox pretender
🗿
i hate kelsey
I knew this was going to a question coz I forgot to add a reference and a remark of my logical approach which I took from the ladder scene about kel's falling rock. So be assured I took it from an indeed logical case.
Well, there's the dialogue after fighting Boss.. . Kel says something like "Good thing Omori held on when he did or we'd all been toast.". . So the above dialogue with Life Jam Guy was most likely cut to avoid conflicting with that and possibly avoid the story/gameplay disconnect of them remembering stuff they shouldn't because they got toasted during that part.
This seems to be heavily implied in blackspace and headspace. There is a “friend factory” room where they are being produced, several skeletons everywhere, and a graveyard room in blackspace featuring killed enemies
Wow, really? Is there a page on the wiki about the friend factory? It sounds interesting.
. . . The room is called “reef area”
Thank you!
my guess is it was supposed to be showing that life jam guy hit them so hard kel doesn't even remember being hit . . &#x200B;. . brain damage 
gaslight gatekeep kelboss
I love how Kel headcanons are either "sweet little scrunkly, the silly little bongle doo, funny, haha at the friendly grimbo conkus" or "angry goblin boy craves violence" with no in-between whatsoever
Real
woah it's niche internet microcelebrity u/myasscrackburns from r/omori
Yes
All the characters probably had a mix of emotions, even Sunny and Basil. . . So... Here's what I think, and be aware I suck at reading characters.. . At first, Aubrey would likely be hysteric and/or lash out at first before fleeing, however eventually I think that she'll reach an understanding. I mean, the lake incident and the stairs incident are quite similar and it was largely luck that the "trauma duo" were saved in time. It's really a matter of her thought process, introspection and possible outside forces: will she need to be told the connection or will she make it herself?. . Kel would probably be in denial and need some time to himself. I'm split about him because there's no way he was able to rebound that quickly and he probably needs at least a month or two to fully process it. He might try talking to Sunny but I doubt he'd be fully comfortable for a while. . . Finally, between the trio, Hero. Hero would likely shut down and leave quickly. He seems like he bottles his emotions and tries to avoid letting the negative ones show and I don't think he'd be angry, just upset that the trauma duo held onto the secret for so long. However, I do believe there is a sense of maturity and I think he'd be more upset at Basil than Sunny. He may or may not even give the pair the benefit of the doubt as they were young. However, that benefit would likely slowly develop over an extended period of time.. . But, as I said, I'm not good at analyzing characters and their expected actions.
Kel was the bro that invited sunny to play again. The group even said that they would stick together and not leave each other when needed most. I don't think kel is the type of person who can hold a grudge, and would be more supportive
Well damn the whole game in one paragraph and also did she forget about kel ?-
 OH MY GOD KEL NO!.
Kel would forgive pretty much instantly. I wouldn’t say Aubrey forgives him right there but she would soon realize it would be hypocrital for her to forgive him considering how everyone forgave her. Hero would take a long time to forgive him. Each of them wouldn’t forgive him instantly only person who could would be kel.
I still think they're bullies. All of them wanted to engage in a fight against Kel, sugesting that they do it regularly. Also, Kim and Vance canonically steal. So yes, they're probably bullies
Skeleton is peeking from behind the spoiler curtains

where's Kel??
kel is irreplaceable 👑
Maybe she comes back? Though that would need a LOT of things to happen so it doesn’t seem *super* likely
"KEL, we have to cook"
Yes its a common thing you see in neighborhoods, usually was a symbol of drug deals, and was likely done to rep that late 90s early 00s look
They simply cannot get along. There is zero romantic chemistry there. Not to mention that Kel's only reaction to any kind of romantic talk or action throughout the game is basically, "Ew, gross!"
Well #1: Kel is a still just a kid for most of the game and #2 he reacts that way because it's usually his brother Hero and Mari being mushy.. . As for no chemistry that's subjective, I think Kel and Aubrey's interactions were my favorite in the whole game.
Kel's in highschool during the events of the game. I don't know what you really mean by "just a kid.". Kel and Aubrey have great interactions, but those interactions are not remotely romantic in nature.
The moments where Kel says "Ewww" to mushy romance happen in Headspace, where Sunny's memories are from when they were 12.. . As for their interactions, early on Kel gets embarassed after Aubrey smiles at him after he cheers her up. They both get flustered after Hero suggests that they're finally getting along. Kel gets annoyed that Aubrey only thanks Omori for coming to save her when it was his idea. And in the real world Kel denies picking on her when they were kids.. . Seems like a basic cats and dogs thing that's implied to me.
Cats and dogs aren't romantic with each other. They get flustered because they are so used to being on each others' case. Like I said before, the only way anybody could see these two as romantic is if they buy into the movie crap that two people who always fight MUST love each other.

MOLDUGA HUNGRY
I hate moldugas worse then lynels
I made the same meme 
Where is it?. . 
On my posts
I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE. . 
Me too Niko from hit game Oneshot, me too.
Oneshot, from the hit indie game Niko?
Stop.
I'm so fucking sick of antler posts it's not even funny I'm actually about to. . 
let the inner American out
this picture is perfect. . . who the fuck is joe biden🤤
Right! Let's beat the sh\*\* out of them!. . 
I wonder how some can hear/say the same joke over and over again and still find it funny.
Idk, I was watching My Little Pony earlier, heard “he has one deer antler” & started laughing & said “is he trans??” 😭 it’s just dumb humour I guess. To be fair I’m also the type of person who enjoys the Josh Hutcherson memes.
It's okay guys, male deers DO have antlers! Kel is just a cisgender deer!
cisgendeer


This is actually the most unfucking funny meme that has ever spawned. . 
unfucking??
unfucking.
it’s even funnier the 50th fucking time !!!!!!!!!!!
NUH UH NUH UH MANHACK SWARM GO. . 
Remember that genderbent kel...
Boring, next meme. . . . (My live reaction)

Why does Kel have antlers? Is he trans?

ok it was funny at first but now it’s getting old
I won't say anything because I myself do overused jokes and sometimes find them funny
omg its almost like you came out the womb with no personality! :D
My actual reaction after seeing the 50th antlers meme (I still don't understand them):. .

He has a swimming pool full of 20 dollar bills
Welcome to money space. . *(This is actually in the game. It's kel in an inflatable pool full of $20 bills)*
Nah, you didn’t put Kel.
No kel so not canon
Can't be canon since Kel ain't there
Wow, these are really cool ideas. An idea I might have with Kel and Last Resort being related could be with Kel moving on after Mari's death. Kel moving on could be seen as him growing as a person and maturing. Hero often says in the real world section how much Kel has grown up. This idea of growing up is then represented by everyone in the dream world now working at the Last Resort, as getting a job is seen as a very mature and grown up thing to do, especially in the eyes of a child.. . This is a massive stretch I just came up with and I guess it's got less to do with the boss of the area compared to your ideas, but it's what I could think of.. . Now we need someone to create a parallel between Humphrey and Basil. Maybe they both have a friendly exterior but hide a darkness within them.

What did the comment sa?
The op was trying to understand why people didn't think about that before but received some downvotes for some reason.
Damn 
I need a high quality version of the live kel reaction
Perhaps that was so at one point during development, but looking at the role he has in the game it's likely that plan got scrapped and the sprites were just reused for a character that uses the throwaway line he says in the final release.
My ass thinking that was Dr. Kel for a second:
Omoriboy, Aubergine, Henry, Kelsey, Hiyori, and Rowan
Bold of you to assume skeletons aren’t technically dead
they both have skeletons
There's no concrete answer, but I feel the text supports eventual forgiveness at the very least. They all come to understand the ways in which the separation hurt themselves and each other, and while Sunny has to leave due to forces outside of his immediate control, the fact that they've come to this understanding means that they're not going to cut him out of their lives completely. It's likely gonna be rough, probably with rocky patches and a number of struggles, and forgiveness is unlikely to be something linear and simple, but I'd say it would happen eventually.
Also they make a point into not showing her face when there carrying her body. You still can’t see her face in the first photo of her hanging but you can see her eye in the next. It’s unlikely the hair moved and I doubt there was wing because there was no other movement in her hair unless she opened her eye voluntarily as a last ditch effort to show she was alive still.
Yeah because why actually try to make meaningful changes to our shitty capitalist system or not buy single game, (which isn’t an essential like food and water is) when you can instead deflect criticism on monetarily supporting a TERF by saying “well acktually no humane way to live in capitalism, meaning it’s okay for me to support a bigot😁!” So that you can play a likely crap videogame?! /s
Tldr
I've seen some weak deflects but this takes the cake
Interested to see why you put Kel in Gryffindor
He is headstrong and sticks to his morals, he has a disregard for rules and can be rambunctious, but is forcefully loyal
I’m pretty sure kel says something along the lines of “wow you never opened the door when I knock” very loose quote and likely totally different but the idea is that Kel has tried to hang out with sunny before, I’m 100% since this is like the very beginning of the game but I’m almost certain kel has tried before

They would kel  each other

Meanwhile.... . : Kel, did you hear something?. . : (sleeping spanishly) .. gibraltar español...
Me and my friend tried to narrow down WHERE Omori takes place, and the best possible answer I got is somewhere in suburban, Northern New Jersey in the late 1990s. It's cool you managed to narrow the year down!
Why northern New Jersey specifically?
I don't think it could be NJ... Because it seems to have pretty warm weather, and as I know, the Northeast is kinda cold.. . As me, I think is California or some state on Southwest because they seem to have the beach near Faraway Town.
lmao I live in Northeast Pennsylvania and the 96 degree weather today says different. we get all seasons up here and it’s very brutal each way
really? Shoot.... . I mean, I'm not from US, but according to series that I know like Seinfeld or The Office, both of them ambiented on Northeast USA, there's not so hot right there, and in winter there snows a lot. And as I seen on Omori there's not to many evidence of snowy weather, just rain.
I don't think at any point in Omori there is shown to be any winter months. The new calender artwork that has come out does show a rather balanced climate which would be right in line for the Northeast. Hot summers, cold winters. I've seen everything from -50F in windchill to 120F with humidity. You get everything up here.
Neat :), good job
i think the real world segments likely take place between 2000-2003. the gameboy sunny is holding in the photo album is red, and red gameboys were first made in 1995. the photos also dated 2/20, which is a month before that gameboy was first released in that year. so the photo album has to have been made in 1996 at the earliest, and the faraway town segments 2000 at the earliest.. . this person goes into that in a bit more detail, as well as some ideas of what year it could be based on the pet rocks. . 
Well I saw an omori video that said that Omori (the future segments) takes place in 2027 (meaning that the stuff from 4 years ago takes place in 2023) but eh, what can you do
My theories were over the minute I saw a Walkman lol
It has to be either 2000 or as I personally thought it 2001, due to the CELL PHONE looking an awful lot like a *certain Nokia* that didn't exist until midway/late that year. I could be wrong, but nonetheless, my research was based almost entirely on graphical queues, nothing going too deep into the lore. Excellent work!  . (Will elaborate later on my dive into this topic if requested.)
I think 2000 as the 404 error thing first came out on windows 95 which came out in like 1995 right?
Hey i like this theory :)
The idea of that is really interesting...  . The idea of Rowan and Hiyori being siblings, since they look similar, is a really nice idea. Two beta, scrapped characters being siblings is quite likely but I guess we might never know...
Aubrey is extremely temperamental, and her initial reaction would likely be far more explosive, and I think that her cooling off period might take a few days. After her initial outburst, her blood would run cold as soon as she recognized the her hypocrisy, almost ending up in a very similar situation(bagel go sploosh). She'd still be furious, but this would cause her to at least control herself. Sunny would probably be in the hospital long enough for Aubrey to visit again once she's cooled off, though, so it probably doesn't make a huge difference in the long run. In a sense though, despite how volatile the process of reconciliation between these two would be, it might actually be healthier, happier, and more organic than between sunny and Kel.. .  Kel bottles up his problems for the sake of helping others, so he'd be... *too* nice about it. He wouldn't give his emotions the chance to release properly. Now, of course kel wouldn't eventually *snap*, but I do think that there would eventually be a fairly stressful conversation between the two of them that would have been a long time coming.. .  I think that hero would take it a little bit worse, but you're right about his rationality and maturity. Distance and time will make things easier between them(he'd probably get sunny's phone number from kel). A luxury that basil(the one who made the plan to frame it as a suicide...  yikes) would not have. I'm concerned for basil.. . . Someone help him.
He in kel place so I think kel won
I could've sworn it was Kel. It was like a month ago, or at least it felt like a month ago.
No it was Goku, they just ended it with a joke.
Guess they just decided to undo Kel's win and repost with Goku as the winner.
it was someone else lol op just did nothing
>op just did nothing. . So you guys lied about the Goku then. . 
You exposed the other replier's watergate scandal.
Yeah that was me :p
Since I don't know result, I'll guess. Kel because he is the best boy.
Originally Kel would've won but devs made it goku
It should be obvious. The real results are the friends we made along the way. . . So Kel.
Woof (my owner Kel won because he so cool)
Kel and Goku won together
I’m petty sure KEL won haha
Kel won.... . what did you think?. . Ofc goku won
Kel in final???  💀
Guys Kel won, don't you remember?

Kel obviously won. In our hearts an in our brains

I'll only say this once so listen to me closely:. . The government has tried to silence me many times before, but the Truth is, there is a 100% permanent cure for Covid. . You heard that right folks! THE CURE FOR COVID IS ORANGE J-
So the cure is just orange juice + coffee? Got it.. . Man, that’ll be easy.
No, the secret ingredient is exactly one drop of Juice-fied Kel
What?
Exactly one drop of Juice-fied Kel
I don’t know what the hell do you mean by that, but I’ll go with it in the way I think it works.
You have been warned

I KNOW,, another 8 hour line-
apparently its preorder only, so nothing (yay!)
The one eating the burger was supposed to be kel since theres memes of that so its canon >:(
Kel is the burger 😭
I must resist the urge to drive 14 hours for Kel burgers
I tell you to follow that urge
They probably wouldn't, it's likely that Hero and Kel don't understand a lot of spanish, even if they come from a country that does, because they've been living in a non-spanish-speaking country since they were very young, and it's easy to forget stuff you did or said at those ages
Yeah but that's because in English, the second person pronoun is "you", regardless of wether it's plural or not, Google Translate can't tell the difference so it translates it to singular (i guess it thinks it's more likely to be that, idk). So, to make it clear, "decirte" is "tell you", but decirles is "tell you (guys)" (although "decirles" can also mean "tell THEM". Spanish is complicated lol)  . . . Source: I'm a native speaker
Happy birthday!. (Also you should add kel to this to make it canon)
Kel would be perfect at throwing a birthday party
He'd bring orange joe for everyone to drink
Kell would be horrible at throwing a birthday party

Yummy potato.. . I put her in there. Every last bit of her, in every last bit of that. I was very careful to make her portions small, too. There might have been some chunks that were bigger than others, but she's as undiscernable as an undercooked piece of potato. Trust me, I've tried some myself. Don't bother splitting one open to find a piece, I've made sure to blend her in good with the potato.. . She's delicious.. . And you'll all be delicious, too.

Iridium is a chemical element with the symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is considered to be the second-densest naturally occurring metal (after osmium) with a density of 22.56 g/cm3 as defined by experimental X-ray crystallography. However, at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, iridium has been calculated to have a density of 22.65 g/cm3, 0.04 g/cm3 higher than osmium measured the same way. Still, the experimental X-ray crystallography value is considered to be the most accurate, and as such iridium is considered to be the second densest element. It is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.

"Kell will now starve to death". So like is he going to eat a clone of himself that is starved to death or what?
There is nothing above him, so he can eat nothing, hence him starving to death
That happened to me too lol
:(
(:<
Guess Kel is eating apple snail eggs for breakfast.
Yummy, apples
 is the post above him for me.
He ate an entire farm, he is now satisfied
For me, this is what he ate: 
He ate a human

I would give you an award if I had one
Thanks, but no need
Too late
Hey wtf I said no need
I knew this was coming lmfao
[Kel is still starving.]()
No, he ate YOU
The post above this is the TF2 sandvich in real life.. . Let's hope Heavy doesn't notice that Kel ate his sandvich.
Heavy shares his sandwich all the time, he would be fine with it
sorry but this is the first post i see....there is no post above him :(
Kel eats bel peppers nice
This is the first post i see though-
dont eat that kel, thats cannibalism. . &#x200B;. . oh nvm there's transphobes you can eat them. . &#x200B;. . *saves the scrabble players*
Hah kelnaballism
and then i actually made a funny OMORI related post and get like 2 upvotes. wow reddit is messed up.. . look at [this]() post. its literally a tonic/pills thingy for psychological treatment which is related to omori but i get like 3 upvotes. what
Kel still has orange joe
kel why are you eating the post with the werewolf-
The one on top has like 3 photos and inside the photos like 10000000000000 fish
Kel is now fat
?
There’s nothing above him to eat, so he will starve
Unless you count the user
Correct, that’s what the top thread on this post is about
It was the same for me when I saw that post, and now your post is at the top for me as well
Wow that is a Sad day in the omori fandom
Kel, please don't eat that one doge above you💀
He will CONSUME THE DOGE

And out of nowhere, I found the same post and turns out he is gonna eat a rat named remy
No ratatouille
It probably tastes like linguini
Yummy
I love how this entire drama started because of a meme around Kel. It would be funny if this drama wasn't so stupid to begin with.
Kel has too much power over us
The power to make all memes that has him in it canon is too unhealthy for the metagame and should be nerfed.
Given how prevalent the communities been even a year after release, I figured ship wars would have escalated at some point, especially with Switch/JP release escalating public consensus soon. Still, of all the things to light the fuse, this is certainly pretty out there
*send to gulag* Communist Babil is......ITS ME COMMUNIST NARU... . . GIVE BACK MY PHONE COMMUNUST NARUTO. . NO FLOWER BOI DATTEBAYO. . ITS ME SOVIET LUFFY ITS MY PHONE. . . Hey guys. . . KEL WHY THE FUCK NOW ITS CANON!!!
Lmao, that's how this started!? I didn't know. That's actually hilarious!
Can you please explain all the drama. I left for like a month
Same, what’s going on??
a guy thought that the nftsexual meme was unironic promotion for nfts
Lemme guess twitter
Where were you, on the day Kel came out as NFT sexual.
Basically, an NFT liker, made an "NFTsexual" flag on Twitter and put KEL over it, and someone posted it here as a joke.
idk wtf is happening im just playing the game (and kelnuking everything)
You should probably put some kels somewhere in the comments to make it canon (don't actually it would be weird to give a female a male's voice unless they look masculine. )
?????? Kel is male?????????
It's because they have the kel flair, making the meme canon.
Ashamed to have the kel flair now
Kels flag crack needs to be made bigger.

Bro why?!?!? What did Kel do to you?!?!?😭. . Hes my fave character too!! HELP
HS kel is just inferior (and by a lot) i don’t know what else to tell you, he’s just boring compared to the RW version
True, but there are worse characters in the game

Nah, I don’t have anything against the RW guy, he can stay a few rounds

I see more Aubrey than Kel, but that doesn't matter to me because Kel is the best character anyways
i relate to kel in pretty much every way possible so that’s why he love him so much
Kel got Obliterated

KEL BALLER 🏀
It has the vibes of an okbuddy sub, but it's the main sub. I've joined and unjoined before because of all the inside jokes I can't understand (still have no idea what goku and kel is behind you was about). Now I'm just here to smile in confusion at shipping tierlists, surreal memes, and upvote interesting art. I have genuinely never seen a more chaotic sub.
I can’t take the fucking hate anymore. He is an adult. I like drawing him like that. Why do you feel the need to say hurtful shit about my drawings and to me? I was insulted. Called a “fem Kel fanboy” and a degenerate. The hate is fucking ridiculous.
yeah its really stupid. i love your drawings and artstyle as a whole and theres literally NOTHING wrong with drawing an ADULT CHARACTER in different clothes, especially when its not even meant to be sexual to begin with. people are just weird. im sorry youre getting so much hate kewl, your drawings are so nice and they bring life to the sub
Yeah, like your drawings ARE REALLY SPECTACULAR and it's just feminine clothes they are not suggestive. You guys just have a dirty mind. Caught yourself in 4k.
I'm so sorry kewl :(
I'm sorry this happened. Like I said on the other post, I'm going to start permabanning the people harassing you if they don't fucking stop it. This has gotten way out of hand.
Thank you.
Thanks mods
Ugh I swear sometimes I swear that either they have self esteem issues and put others down because they're too busy thinking of how shit they are (they're wrong 90% of the time) or they were neglected as a child causing them to become little shits.... . I'm always here if you need someone to talk to, though! 
Its absolutely terrible and should definitely not be happening.ik it might be hard but u should just ignore anyone who says shit abiut your art. Its amazing and if they dont like it its their problem
dw kewl, just remember that the vast majority of us absolutely love your art & art style, and you can hold your head up high knowing that you are an amazing artist and nothing anybody says can change that. you're one of the few people who actually puts some effort into what they post, and you really make this sub a vibrant place with your art. wear your crown, kewl 👑
The people who come here just to complain about the other thing don't just suddenly disappear after they win.. . This community was made a place for sneering, rewarded for sneering, people were subscribed for the sole purpose of sneering.  Now it sneers at the next thing, and the next, until all the content creators like yourself leave and nothing beside remains.  . It doesn't matter if the sneering was righteous or not.. . There are many others here (indeed, the majority; there are less than 1K people who are triggered by everything and >100K who are just here for the art and not commenting) who appreciate your work.  Don't let it kill your enthusiasm.
I'm new to what's going on but I just looked through and I like your art! Dunno what any assholes have been saying to you but I really hope it doesn't stop you, you seem cool
Your drawings have been the main reason i didnt leave this sub yet. Seriously bless your soul, i hope youre doing alright despite the hate
I personally like your art but this is the internet and people will find a way to get mad at the littlest things. Willing to bet someone out there got triggered by a dog getting pet or something it's very dumb.
Thank you. I have seen so much drama going around on this sub and this needed to be said, and you said it really well. . And to anyone reading this, everyone in this subreddit, as long as they are not constantly being problematic or breaking rules, are more than welcome here to post what they like. Kewl hasn’t done anything wrong and their artwork is genuinely good, even if you don’t like the art, just scroll past and don’t say anything. Some of the things I’ve seen said about Kewl are unnecessarily mean or unfair. . Now that that’s been said, can we go back to Kel and the funny lil burgers on his mind 
Stalin Kel would’ve explained better tbh
That's the thing. They've apologized. And their "harassment" as they said, was just a single reply. If they were meant to be punished, then they've gotten what they deserved with this thread.. . But you're going beyond that. In this case, you've become the harasser. This is exactly what this post is talking about. You're acting like some high judge that has the right to punish someone a thousand fold but you're just some guy with a kel pfp on reddit. Get that reality check and realize the situation you're in.
- No, it was not a "single comment" as they said. You can search for it, although I'm probably sure they've deleted it by now. . - No, I don't act like a high judge, because I ain't trying to punish anyone myself, rather point out they, in fact, deserve it. This punishment would be in hands of the moderators. So no, the "You believe you're a high judge" argument doesn't work here. . - Trying to use the others PFP just to try and make them look worse is pretty sad, don't you think? You see me, idk, making fun of your likings or something lol? But hey, I'm the one who needs the reality check. . - And as for that same reality check, you really don't know nothing huh? First of all, as I said, it wasn't a single comment, check it if it's not deleted by now. Second, I obviously know I have no powers, so this punishment I think he should deserve is in the mods hands. And lastly, the (probably) best argument to prove who actually needs the reality check: I don't go around trying to make others look worse cuz their PFP ffs.. . So, why don't you do the same? Realize the situation you're in and get a reality check.
You do realize that you are now another aggressor rather than a person helping the victim of the situation, right? This is hypocritical. Why continue to spread hate towards others when the whole point of helping kewl is to prevent hate towards her?

you were supposed to explode and die . . we went over this. . that's it, I'm taking your Omori fandom privileges. you have lost the right to say every Kel meme is canon. Come back when you've reconsidered your life choices. . /j
You beta watch Ur cheekscuz aliens aren't sleepin' 👽💤 I ain't followin' ur words
every kel meme is canon, does it mean he has infinite sexuality?
Plot twist: Kel is every sexuality and a strong ally 😎
This doesn't mean it's true though - just that Kel said that he wasn't NFT-Sexual at some point. Unfortunately, he could be lying...
"\[deleted\]". . literally 1984
Counter argument: Picture of Kel saying he is nftsexual
I love Kel. .

idk what they're talking about but if we go off the name it's pretty likely it's this one:. . . . I haven't read it so I don't know what its about neither lol, enter at your own risk ig
what the fuck, Kel?
Criticism of any kind can harm people's views of anything they do. I think it's just something they have to learn to deal with.. . If you exclusively want compliments you can just show it to your friends but when showcasing **anything** publicly I do think criticism should be most welcome by everyone.. . I just don't believe it's something people should shy away from saying just because someone may take it badly. It's all for the sake of improvement after all (which you're most likely interested in if you mind the criticism at all, anyways).
Im not saying that you cant give criticism, my gripe is with people giving criticism on pieces that it wasnt asked for. Criticism is a great way to help people make their art look better ! But when someone is proud of something theyve made, post it, and get criticism without asking for it? It can definitely hurt.
There's definitely some people who are way too focused on telling the artist everything they did 'wrong' and giving an exhaustive list of things to improve on, but I still don't think it's something you're supposed to ask permission for. . . Expecting everything 100% positive from any showcase in a public setting is just kinda silly imo. Even if you personally don't want criticism surely there's someone else who will make use of suggestions, and it's not hard to just ignore 'reviewesque' comments on a piece you don't care about "improving" on.. . I get the struggle though. I'm no artist of course but I get anxious whenever I'm about to upload anything online and just dance around the upload button for half an hour just because I'm scared of reception (yes even on a shitpost lol)
Kel murderd omori to prove he doesn't omor
Omori fans when they noticed how the skeleton in the second video was hanged: 😱.
update button i'm not rainbow flag. . butt if leaves was a i have no idea what that is but given the context im assuming it's called a fem male id bee rainbow flag for leaves. . edit: nvm it's apparently called a reel
I don’t blame you for not knowing
So femboys, basically
Yup

Fair enough
Update I’m no pride greed’s butt if leaves was a reel male I’d bee pride 4 leaves
IS THAT ULTRA GREED ASS
Of course it is
i’m thinking it’s “kel i’m not gay, but if basil was a real boy id be gay for basil” (i’m guessing kel for the first word bc key and kel are one letter away)
You got it the key was just supposed to be update
Update: I'm cancel flag ass if spice was A pencil sharpener man I'd bumblebee flaf 4 spice
keyboard 2 letters wrong rainbow ass 2 letters 3 dots leaves 3 letters 1 letter handheld camera circle with arrow 2 letters anthophila rainbow number leaves. . &#x200B;. . yeah that seems right
How the f can i understand this?
Update im prohibition lgbt butt if leaves was a pencil sharpener male I'd bug lgbt four leaves. . Every kel meme is artillery. . Edit: canon
I thought the reel was some kind of canon so I just went with it and it worked
Just use a picture with Kel on it
REMEMBER WHEN KEL FLEXES HE FEELS AT BEST

still eliminating any of them feels like a bad decision. . ESPECIALLY .

I didn't think you'd notice my absence, LOL. But I have content to post, I'm just shy to share it(?)
I mean Teiko is probably my favorite omori oc so I would certainly love seeing some more of her again
Man I haven't been in this sub for a while, I was here when it was whenthekel/Higd3/Justaweirdpersonn, those were for me 😭-
Kel makes it canon, it is allowed
Poor kel, he will be missed

kel
Definitely not, because there is a genetic factor and Kel would still be taller than him anyway
If the DW version is their heights 4 years before the game, that means Kel's growth rate is more than 10 cm/year.. . Kel is really an absolute unit.
In the real world, kel said he "grew at least a foot taller since hero left for college" too
kel’s rate of growth is abnormal, he might wanna get that checked by a doctor 
When he said he could "feel it in his bones" about his height, he meant it! Those things have been *stretching.*
Kel went from 4'9 to 6'3 in 4 years
Bro, Kel's 192 cm already? Mf gonna have trouble not hitting the ceiling in an average height room when he's 20 damn
bro wtf boys stop growing at 16 tho? wdym he'd still grow until 20 :V. . I'm a 5'7" 19 year old, can I get some of yout copium?. . ITS OVER FOR ME PLEASE HELP, kekw.
i think kel could still grow like an inch so i assume by the time he stops growing he'd already be like 6'3, kel will sadly never be the taller brother... UNLESS
Why is nobody talking about kel being 192 fucking cm??
TIL Kel and I share a height, this is the best day of my life
Real world kel is so LONG and I fucking hate it
I refuse to believe Kel is 6'3" lol
kel is the same age as me and like an entire foot taller than me :wtf:
KEL is a giant!
Woah Kel is a fucking tree
Open the door to kel in 1st playthrough
Stay away from the fandom, try to not search anything related to the game on youtube (there's spoilers in the titles too), never go on the wiki and finally, if you decided to open the door to Kel you might wanna water the flowers whenever you get the occasion to, if you decided to not open the door this is not relevant (that choice is a major one and lead to two different routes ; people will often recommend you a certain one, but honestly it doesn't matter if you plan to do both)
Open the door for Kel
Don’t bother about saving items, they’ll most likely just sit in your inventory till the end of the game
Fight every enemy you see, except maybe bears. If you try to avoid random encounters you’ll likely be underleveled for the boss battles. I learned this the hard way.
Anti-kel propoganda smh
Dont please I dont want to summon hellkel
Oh i already did tho now we playin basketball with hellkel. Hes a cool dude even tho he looks like a hellspawn.
alright kel hater! /j
FUCK I wanted the skeleton to appear or maybe a rickroll, I never could have predicted this
The "right setup" is the Nuke Kel?
correct 
When in doubt, coffee, narcissism, and Cuphead are classed as a WMD if you need a leg up
I'm not denying the inevitable pain it'll bring me, but I do believe Kel's luck does influence garbage and slots.
How does this happen fr . . This boss was very easy (KEL GOOO). . maybe it's cuz I play RPGs weirdly
I beat him just now, apparently the reason I’ve been stuck on this battle for the past 2 years (literally since 2021) was cause I was level 5
There are almost no battles in the game that I found difficult… and I wouldn’t call myself an expert strategy RPGer by any means. If you’re ever having issues in this game, just do a little grinding.
Yeah I wander too much = I fight too much. . I have a sense of which path is the correct one and never go it until the end
LOL one of my favorite things about RPGs:. . Character A: Hurry! We have to catch them!. . Me: **goes and does six side quests, grinds for four hours, upgrades all equipment, explores area of game that I originally missed**. . Me: **finally crosses from original screen in to next screen**. . Character A: We made it just in the nick of time!
IN YAKUZA 7: LIKE A DRAGON:. . "3 million yen??? How are we gonna get that!!??". . ***Has 300 million***. . `goes to npc`. . Npc: thanks for the money, we will now need a participant for the election thing. . Character: we worked our ASSES OFF TO BARELY GET THIS, now we have more steps??!?. . (Later in story, npc gives money back because it's "alot")
Kel nuke tf out of him
i know it's damn near impossible to achieve, but 179k damage is fucking insane. if kel's run and gun is a nuke, last resort is goddamn death star
LOL yeah. . for all intents and purposes, Red Hands will deal the most damage. But... I mean... if you *really* wanted to... I suppose you could make an OMORI death star . . 
**UPDATE (this comment is really long, so shrink it to look at the rest)**. . There are seven more skills I'd like to look at before we end our adventure. Some of them are... rather surprising, in my opinion. I won't be as wordy this time, though.. . Note that Humphrey's Face actually heals when he swallows, so it's pretty easy to get him to zero juice. I'll edit the above post accordingly.. . ————————————————————. . **Hack Away (2.25 × atk - def, three times when angry)**. . Let's abuse a sad Humphrey Face (**19** defense) in the Basil rush. If we use the branch coral's sacrifice (+10), mush (+1), cookie (+10), red knife (+13), red ribbon at full energy (+21), furious (×2), both release energy buffs (×1.5), sno-cone (×1.2), and tier 3 attack buffs (×1.5), we end up with **783** attack.. . With tier 1 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, we end up with. .     dmg = [(783 × 2.25 - 19) × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2] × 3 = 14122.275,. . rounding to an astonishing **14122 damage.**. . ————————————————————. . **Beatdown (2 × atk - def, three times)**. . Abusing a miserable Snaley 1 (**4** def) with no juice this time. With mush (+1), cookie (+10), baseball bat  (+20), red ribbon at full energy (+21), enraged (×1.5), release energy (×1.25), sno-cone (×1.2), and tier 3 attack buffs with look at Kel (×1.5), we get **546.75** attack.. . With tier 3 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, we end up with. .     dmg = [(546.75 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2] × 3 = 14714.25,. . rounding to **14714 damage.**. . ————————————————————. . **Ricochet (2 × atk - def, three times, 30% damage variation)**. . Again, we're using a miserable Snaley 1 (**4** def). With mush (+1), cookie (+10), snowball (+13), red ribbon at full energy (+21), enraged (×1.5), release energy (×1.25), and sno-cone (×1.2), we end up with **281.25** attack.. . With tier 3 emotion advantage, crit, max damage variance (it's 30% now!), and flex (on the first hit ONLY), the first hit will deal. .     dmg (1) = [(281.25 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.3 × 1.5 + 2] × 2.5 = 6811.71875,. . while the other two will do. .     dmg (2,3) = [(281.25 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.3 × 1.5 + 2] × 2 = 5449.375,. . for a rounded total of **12261 damage**.. . ————————————————————. . **Attack Again (2 × atk - def, then 2 × atk + lck - def twice)**. . What a surprising contender. We'll use furious, since it's a bit more efficient to boost attack rather than luck. So sad Humphrey Face (Basil rush) (**19** def) it is.. . If we use the branch coral's sacrifice (+10 atk, +10 lck), mush (+1 atk, +1 lck), cookie (+10 atk, +10 lck), red knife (+13 atk, +6 lck), Abbi's eye (+40 atk, +40 lck), furious (×2 atk), both release energy buffs (×1.5 atk, ×1.8 lck), sno-cone (×1.2 atk, ×1.2 lck), and tier 3 attack buffs (×1.5 atk), we end up with **885.6** attack and **155.52** luck.. . With tier 1 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, the normal attack does. .     dmg (1) = (885.6 × 2 - 19) × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 4732.94,. . and the extra attacks will do. .     dmg (2,3) = [(885.6 × 2 + 155.52 - 19) × 1.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2] × 2 = 10305.688,. . for a surprisingly huge **15039 damage**.. . ————————————————————. . **Look at Omori (2 × Aub's atk - def, then 3 × Aub's atk + lck)**. . These followups are surprisingly good, so let's try a few more against a miserable Snaley (**4** def).. . Using mush (+1 atk, +1 lck), cookie (+10 atk, +10 lck), Sweetheart bust (+20 atk), Abbi's eye (+40 atk, +40 lck), enraged (×1.5 atk), release energy buffs (×1.25 atk, ×1.25 lck), sno-cone (×1.2 atk, ×1.2 lck), and tier 3 attack buffs (×1.5 atk), we end up with **610.875** attack and **81** luck.. . With tier 3 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, the normal attack does. .     dmg (1) = (610.875 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 5481.875,. . and the look attack does. .     dmg (2) = (610.875 × 3 + 81) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 8613.3125,. . for a total of **14095 damage**. \[1\]. . ————————————————————. . **Pass to Omori (2 × Kel's atk - def, then 2 × Kel's atk + 2 × Omori's atk - def)**. . Miserable Snaley (**4** def) again. The pass does damage before changing Omori's emotion. We'll put all the extra attack on Kel (except for Abbi's eye; he can't use flex that way), since he has an extra attack at the beginning, as well as Flex.. . So Kel's attack with mush (+1), cookie (+10), snowball (+13), red ribbon at full energy (+21), enraged (×1.5), release energy buffs (×1.25), and sno-cone (×1.2) will be **281.25**. Omori's with red knife (+13), Abbi's eye (+40), furious (×2), release energy buffs (×1.25), and sno-cone (×1.2) will be **462**.. . With tier 3 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, the normal (flexed) attack does. .     dmg (1) = [(281.25 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2] × 2.5 = 6288.125,. . while the (non-flexed) pass attack does. .     dmg (2) = (281.25 × 2 + 462 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 6673.25,. . for a total of **12961 damage**. \[1\]. . ————————————————————. . **Pass to Aubrey (2 × Kel's atk - def, then 2 × Kel's atk + 2 × Aub's atk - def)**. . Miserable Snaley (**4** def) again. We're putting all the extra attack on Kel, except for Abbi's eye, so his attack will still be **281.25**. Aubrey with Abbi's eye was already calculated to have **610.875** attack.. . With tier 3 emotion advantage, crit, and max damage variance, the normal (flexed) attack does **6288.125** damage (calculated above), and the pass attack does. .     dmg (2) = (281.25 × 2 + 610.875 × 2 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 8013.125,. . for a total of **14301 damage.** \[1\]. . ————————————————————. . **Juice Me (25% heart)**. . Wait, what? How will this do any damage?. . Well, if we use juice me against someone with 9999 hp from flower farming, we can do surprising damage. So... what if we used that? lol. . An ecstatic flexed Kel against a furious Omori with 9999 hp will do.... .     dmg = (9999 × 0.25) × 2.5 × 2.5 = 15623.4375,. . which, astonishingly, can do **15623 damage**. \[2\]. . ————————————————————. . So yeah. Absolutely insane. I've updated the table at the top.. . ————————————————————. . \[1\] Snaley will actually die after the normal attack. Let's ignore that; it's more fun this way.. . \[2\] Juice Me has no crit chance or damage variance.
You can try using the skill swap glitch to give Kel vertigo, then do kel nuke except replace run n gun with vertigo.
What about using skill swap to put vertigo on kel
it is 1.5 x speed - def.. . The “5” might come from the coffee; it gives Kel a tier +3 buff, which is x5 speed. More information can be found on omori.wiki!
I say Kelsey on there and almost freaked out
You can also not answer kel after the first day and also get hikkikomori
yeah >!but it blocks out every suicide ending because kel took your knife after the fight with aubrey!<
Woah really? I always assumed it was a different knife
Worth mentioning that the smelly hobby at faraway park can either give you a gold watch or a "gold" watch, one is worth much more than the other. You can reload a save until you get it, but money won't matter too much as long a you do the side jobs.
if you want absolute dough on 1 day left give lots of money to the other hobo, the one lying on the grass.
this is awesome for when I force my friends to play the game thank you
Hahaha
I Recently got into OMORI and just finished the game, I love to 100% Games That I have a heart for. And this guide really help a lot with the Achievement/Badge "Universally Loved" I 100% Recommend this guide.
I'm working on this achievement right now, and my third playthrough of OMORI, and this is exactly what I needed. 🤩
This was the best guide I could've ever found, thank you 💜
You forgot that you can read comics with your friends at Hoobez on one day left :)
Really needed this, thank you. I forgot if I talked to Mincy or not on the first evening and trying to remember everything there was to do again was so annoying.
HOW DO I BEAT THE GINO GUY GRAHHHH
I think that one's just completely random, so just select anything and replay until you win
After going through that like 20 times, yeah, it was really random but i kinda won after copying what he did for the next move
I AM CRYING LAUGHING OVER KEL IN THE PET ROCK MINI-GAME HAVING A 100% CHANCE TO PICK ROCK GOD THAT'S SO FUNNY. .   . (thanks for the guide btw op! really thankful for the notes that are there to help you not accidentally make achievements impossible aha...) i am genuinely shocked that i didn't mess up the fight with the CHICKEN? at the top of dino's dig my first run through... discovering that item organically and seeing what it did was the funniest shit 11/10 would relive that moment again. breaks my heart that not everyone got to experience it that way </3. . Sincerely, The future
Welp, gonna add that too to the post in case your comment doesnt get much upvotes. Glad you managed to fix it friend !. . Enjoy Derpy Kel's return
It technically should... . . Here, try this. Im gonna reply to you with a comment with only the Derpy Kel emoji. Use the 3 dots, copy it and paste it. If it works, save it on your notes/clipboard and just replace the digits to change the OMOJI!
If it ain't my good friend and fellow Derpy Kel enjoyer BreezyCat128 !. . It seems the Derpy Kel Army will not need to march to war with the mods since he is back  (even if it's by using some random code lol)
Yeah! Of course I love smiley Mari, but derpy Kel shall reign supreme! 
I'll wait patiently until Queen Aubreylizabeth the Third gets thrown over by King Kelsey The First, Sovereign Governor of Kel-Land 
XD that’s amazing! 
what's the second kel code
found it
IT IS HIM THE DERPY KEL!!1!1!
Oops, seems it hasnt worked for you... Need any help?? I'd be glad to help you, i've pretty much helped a good bunch of persons until now . . And dont thank me, it's all Sir0's work, I just tried to get their post some more praise and some "spotlight". If I did this in the first place was because he didn't post it on r/OMORI, plus to me and some other fellers his links didnt work. But yeah, the one to thank is him, i'm just like the postman delivering from his profile to the subreddit haha. . Anyways, the most common problem are the backslashes. Try to look for any of those and delete it before commenting. . Remember, its mobile only, no PC . . The quickest way to do it: Search for a comment with the Derpy Kel face, for example, in this post (they are a good bunch and any deleted omoji will work). . Use the 3 dots to copy it, then paste it on another comment to see if it worked. . If it did, go to your clipboard/notes on your phone and save it there. . When you want to post that omoji or a different one, just copy and paste it changing the digits to match the omoji you want! Hope this helps 
I’m on a tablet so in theory it should work like how mobile does. I’m also wondering if it’s the / used in the u/  mention causing this, because if so that’s interesting.. . Also, without messenger pigeons some wars would’ve never been won, the person who spreads the info is just as important, otherwise nobody would see it!
Haha, that's really nice of you friend . . It's probably related to the backslashes, those also mess with the u/ sometimes (gotta hate the \\ ). . But anyways, you should try and go to a comment with only a deleted omoji, copy it, and paste it. If it works, just save it in your notes/clipboard and change the digits for the one omoji you want in every situation. . If you need any more help contact with no worries 
hitting someone with a basketball isn't sharp so all of kel's weapons should technically always be dull
So you're saying I should tape nails or knives to his basketball?
Preciscly
Joel Miller approves
Kel is a walking nuke
Running*
heh
Stare is the weirdest skill in the game by a mile, it confuses the everliving f\*ck out of AI so much xd
If someone just kept staring at me while we were fighting I would be confused too
THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
I remember hearing that the AI is set to use it on the member with the most speed, does stare affect the speed stat?
Yes, both of those are correct. Coffee is programmed to target the highest speed, so if you debuff Kel’s speed specifically, it’ll go to Aub instead. And yes, Stare does in fact affect the speed stat, along with attack and defense.
Good guide! one thing you can also do for kel nuke, is using the flex move obtained after junk yard, which will make his next attack deal alot more damage.
I forgot about flex. . damn.... . When I make the next nuke guide this should be corrected
Tickle + multi hit attacks > Kel Nuke. . 
Tickle is really good
Thank you! (Also remember to Flex and feel your best for the Kel nuke (I forgot to add flex ))
Thank you. I never was able to do this as I never knew about it when I played though I did got close with Kel as I used everything except coffee on him.
Your welcome! (Also lol)
Have Kel make the enemy angry and flex too, so you can deal 5400 damage instead of the usual 1350 damage
if you equip the chicken ball on kel it helps
Thank you for your help! I’m sorry for the late reply. I saw someone on Reddit advise someone to make sure to get the Z key last because they had heard someone else say that they encountered a glitch where their game didn’t load the abyss. I tried googling it several different ways just now but I can’t get google to bring up the post where someone commented that. Sorry :/ at least know I now it’s most likely not an issue oof
No worries! If you can find that post, I'm still open to checking the claims posted. For now, I would assume there is no bug unless you experience it yourself. It's also worth considering that mods may have affected the outcome, as my discovery revealed. It should also be noted if this was a bug that existed during an earlier version of the game which was patched out. All of that aside, I wouldn't worry.
Thanks so much for your help! I have dumb questions if you happen to know the answers. Does Abbi have new dialogue after you gather her gifts? I’d like to talk to her but going through the abyss takes so long.. . I don’t really know anything about the boss rush, but I’ve heard you end up fighting your party. Does the gear you have equipped to them affect how strong they are during the battle? Are they stronger in battle because you give them end game gear/does changing their equips before the battle help at all? Having only two people in your party and no Kel nuke to help you sounds hard lol so I want to help balance it.. Thanks again, you’re a saint for this guide.
Not dumb questions at all!. . 1. ABBI does not have unique dialogue after gathering all her gifts. She does have dialogue after >!sparing!< her, if that's what you mean. Otherwise, she will say nothing new regardless of how many gifts you collected.. . 2. Before answering, you should note that >!only console editions of the game!< include battling your friends. If you're on >!PC without mods!<, you won't encounter this fight at all.. . Now to answer your question, nothing you do related to your old party affects the simulated battle: everyone's STATS are unaffected by any WEAPONS or CHARMS you had on the party previously.
OP is replying 2 years after initial post. 🐐
:D
You have to open the door twice to Kel to be on the true route. If you open the door and ignore it the second day you get the alternate route.
 burger no pickles
 (He does not like pickles.)
eat the pickles kel. . NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

When I first went into the dungeon and tried to eat the pickles with Kel tagged I fr thought you just couldn’t recover there

eat the pickles kel
 I asked for NO pickles
Just like me fr 
He doesnt like milk in the real world despite drinking it in headspace 🤨
I've got pickle-less burgers on my mind
When I first played, I thought this meant that I could never recover health from this picnic cause Kel wouldn’t eat the pickles. Which was really annoying with all of the fights in this area. . . Took me until like my third playthrough to realize all you have to do is tag literally anyone but Kel as the leader.
Kel is missing out 
Kel I love you but what the hell is wrong with you what the ever living hell is this. No. Nononono. I refuse. You- you can’t be doing this to me no nononono. This is terrible. Pickles are great.. right.. kel.??? Pickles are amazing! Right? Kel?
u/KEL-DW do you agree with him
If you try to heal with the pickles with Kel as party leader, he just won't eat them.
Don't forget, he takes Kel's tooth
Imagine if this event permanently changed this expression to just be missing a tooth
That would be amazing
Dont need therapy, only need Kel memes
Do the Kel nuke. Takes around 1,5 hours to do. You need coffee, chicken ball, rabbit ears, something to lower enemy defense, make kel happy, make enemy angry. Find some tutorials online. It's really easy and one hits the enemy:2464:.. . Kel is overpowered and I GOT BURGERS ON MY MIND :2464::2464::2464:
Im very late, but  . Here's how I defeated them in one go (and the best thing is, the girls didn't even get to change the emotion, they only change the heart and juice):-. . 1. Omori: Confetti. 2. Aubrey: Team Spirit - Omori. 3. Kel: Annoy the girls. 4. Hero: smile (I equipped the thingie which makes him happy from the start). 5. Omori: Hack Away. 6. Aubrey: Team Spirit - Kel. 7. Kel: Ritochet or sumn. 8. Hero: smile (3 turns, until their stk can't be lowered). 9. Omori: Hack Away (Continue doing this, till he runs out of juice, then use Snacks). 10. Aubrey: Power Hit (3 times, I think, and once done just help with snacks or just making others happy). 11. Kel: Ritochet (snacks if no juice). 12. Hero: smile / cook / snacks.. . My team was close to level 25 and 26.  . Hope this helps
You can also use Ricochet from Kel if you don't have Dynamite
Kel approved 
kel would be proud 
Did you enjoy it? I'm sure that Kel would have... 
Yes,it seriously wasn't that bad.
Well, that's good! It's nice to meet a fellow Orange Joe enjoyer here 
If youve heard of a kel bomb thats what i did to destroy him still took a while tho
I used happy kel nuke, with x2 omori stare debuffs, and aubery making kel (and maybe omori) happy, and then attacking. I constantly beat him and used some items when the gang was low on juice.. . . I was level 28 at the time if that's important
make kel ecstatic, give him coffee, make humphrey angry, use kel's flex before using run 'n gun. With one coffee you can do 3 kel nukes  . Note: If you have fox tails DO NOT RELEASE ENERGY
This post was made by Kel
Hope this helps! 
Certainly.
Do the r/omori gods respect me now? 
?
NVM that was a dumb question
I respect everyone who respect me.
I respect u
Then I respect you.
That was so silly but so wholesome at the same time. 
Ikr, that's why I like r/OMORI
Might try this later, thank you
Interesting, but they probably use something else besides that (because of the caffeine)
Just gotta find a good balance, like everything in life I suppose 
I’m gonna fucking KEL you.
These are great tips! . . Now only if the console versions of the game would come out.
Just saw it on Game Pass today, so pumped to play.
I know I'm 7 months late. But how do I build up the characters. I just started the game yesterday played just until I learnt how to switch characters. Is it worth breaking the watermelons and usually everyone says anger the characters and make the hostile mobs sad
I break all watermelons. Can you elaborate more on building characters? You can things to build your character based on how much you’re discovering or fighting bosses.
Uh 14 on your list is what I mean
Based on the items you get, there are statistics. For Kel, the more the speed, the better he is. If yoyre starting out, you might not find many things with speed but later on as you level up, you will find things that can boost Kels speed.
What items and how do you find them
When you do quests, you automatically get couple of items. They’re called weapons and charms. Both of these have different atttributes, and based on that, you make a strong character. You can DM me if you still didn’t understand
Thanks king I'll dm you tomorrow because I have an exam to study for
hey, sorry to come and revive you just for this but what other stats should I focus for the other characters?
The only character that is acceptable for contract is Kel
Frankly the only place acceptable for contract is a trash can
If the contract only lowered Health, I probably would consider putting it on Kel since he dies if anyone just looks at him the wrong way. It lowering Juice as well is what makes it bad.
I still wouldn't. Suviving 2 attacks vs 1 is a huge difference, since you can heal him back up to full every turn so his "I die in 2 hits" extends to "I die only when you run out of heals".
You can also get trash by smashing barrels in Last Resort! I waited until the last day in the Hikkikomori route to recycle and only had to farm 5 more extra cans.
Ohhhhh right. You get computer parts from those. Thank you so much! I just got the achievement, but this will be super helpful for others.
You can also get can by petting the dog that is in Vast Forest, that worked good for me.
the menu trick didnt work rip 
Wait if u run up the ladder while the frames of invulnerability the other enemy will run out faster 
Is it true that if you come back to the junkyard after beating Captain Spaceboy Kel is unable to farm trash? I am trying to get rhe achievement late game and ive been through a dozen fights and I only get the "Kel doesnt find anything" message.
I was replaying otherworld section, and when I killed happy dial up, I got a computer part.
Hmm, can anyone think of a name for Cris x Kel
I just don’t really get it. . wdym right wing propaganda? . . Also why is “Hispanic Kel” so far down? I thought it was a widely accepted take
As I said, there's nothing to understand. It's just a meme whose target audience is people trying to make sense of it.
The fact that Angry vs Sad would still be fine... IF ENEMIES ACTUALLY GAVE A SHIT ABOUT LOSING JUICE. Because their attacks don't use juice anyway, sad on enemies is just broken.. . I would still love to use sad on my team, even if juice is actually useful here. You can just Hero and Kel to fill up everyone's juice again and again! But it's the only emetion that is impossible to spread to your team other than using "sad poem" 4-9 times in a row, which is both very slow, and wastes too many turns... Of course, there are toys, but I don't like to use toys to win my battles... Toys and snacks feel like cheating xD. . . It's a little sad, because I love how little damage you take while sad, especially with Gator's Aid, but there's simply no good skill/follow-up to spread it to everyone... I also really like how powerful Kel's Megaphone is, being able to enrage everyone in just 2 turns while only using 1 single character to do so... It's just too bad that sad enemies are so broken.... So I'll just stick to using Happy, I suppose...
I would like to add a few things to this guide.. . First of all: don't even bother trying to attempt a Kel nuke, since the boss pretty much reduces your speed every single turn.. . Only use Hero exclusively for the snack time ability, or to use juice items for omori since this boss's gonna deal a lot of damage.. . Keep in mind that being a 3 phase enemy, it has a lot of health. And by that, i mean *a lot.*. . So keep using the red hands ability for omori and use strong attacks for both Aubrey and Kel (like beatdown and ricochet.). . Also, if more than one of your team member dies- don't even bother trying to revive them. You'll just die in the process if you do not heal yourself instead (especially in the last phase.). . If you REALLY have to, use jam packets for whoever has the hogehst speed so that they'll go first, and then use an item like whole pizza or chicken to heal everyone. It's a tad risky tho, because the enemy can attack you before you get the chance to do the heal.. . (oh- and lastly of course, use the energy release immediately when you get the chance. You'll get a lot of energy since the boss attacks multiple times with a group attack as well.)
Ooh I didn't know the kel and Pluto one, thanks
no prob :)
It took you 15 runs to find that? How do you even have the patience to play the game that many times?
He's going for the Hikikomori IRL run
Yeah lol
FR
i just really like the game and it somehow makes me feel comfortable. so during my saddest periods i play it and everytime i play it slower and slower and fing new stuff
15?
yeah :>
Yeah, the flower method is actually broken. Since the flowers have a chance to wilt on screen transitions,  you can get as much health as you'd like and then combine that with Last Resort to get the only way to beat 1 day left bread twins in one turn
There is one thing you're forgetting about with angry vs sad - sad enemies are generally less likely to use attack moves, which means they won't be dealing damage to you as much in the first place. So, angry vs sad isn't all that bad.
I was slightly uncomfortable listening to kel like- idk for 30 seconds
I would really like to see a full-fledged game released. But it most likely won't be released before 2026
Waiting such a long time is gonna be rough, but I bet it’ll be well worth it!
That's for sure! 
I fucking love otermerson
fr this mod was so peak that I forgot It was fanmade and not official while playing. I hope that Kel will understand and forgive Basil in the next part because I can't stand him being angry at him 
sadge
indeed 😔😔
Oh my god poor dude 😭
wait you know omori?
Yeah, I know quite a bit of fanbases 😋 (though I don't know them all)
MY SON NOO
FAQ for this segment.. . * Why did Sunny go to Kel's side before the fight started?. . Main reason for that is it's supposed to imply that Sunny started it in order to "move him out of the way." >!Sound familiar, doesn't it?!<. . * What the HELL is that Kel battle sprite?. . It's a placeholder until I get one.. . * You used the wrong "you're" during Kel's dialogue.. . I know.. . * When will this come out?. . I don't know, but I aim to have a day 1 demo out very soon. As per the rest of the days, we'll see.
hahahahahaha, Kel oh how hard it will be on the second day, Kel vs 7 people
My main reasoning on making him interact is mainly because I felt it'd just be odd if he did nothing. Usually, Kel filled the odd silences, so there has to be something to replace it.. . I actually made the intro sequence where he leaves his house as well, can post it if you want me to.. . Anyways, thank you !
You are welcome, also you can post it, sure
Hey uhh berry cat got tired today she’s too old for this shit, so goalkeeper cat gon be the one haunting you today. . 


Ok that's really funny. . also, 🇧🇾 mentioned
Is Kel...dead?
I like this but... Where kel?
Who's Kel? 
He 
Even at that its still lowk tough, its hard to keep kels dumbass alive with rng sometimes, then by the time you reapply all his effects he dies again, plus using kel nuke is seen as cheating to lots of people
Kel nuke is reliable, and imo it isnt that powerful? Kel nuke has always done max 1800 damage for me, thats not a lot imo when lasr resort can do 2000+
If it can only do 1800 hundred damage that’s a skill issue. I can get a kel nuke to do 8000+ damage it’s pretty easy get kel ecstatic coffee make enemy angry flex and run and gun. The best weapon to use if you can get it is chicken ball which makes Kel’s base speed over 200
With all speed ups you can basically one shot the boss
Watching this outside my brother’s room. If I weren’t so dehydrated, I’d likely be balling, but not KEL style
It was the April dev-log on the mod-author's Tumblr, which indicated a Dec 25th release for what I assume was 'Book 1'.  Seems like the newest dev-log indicates a likely delay.. . Not sure what you mean by 'offshoot fan-games', unless that's your interpretation of the 5 "books" that the game is subdivided into.  But if there's more good Omori mods to be had from the same person, I would love to know about them.
modding, most likely
Yes, i wanted to date kel
The multiple yeses and all that when answering were funny to me. I hated it when every chance they got they just talked about their relationship. Like cool your dating let’s try not to make it all about you ? Thanks. Also when the Apple and Orange guys were fighting I couldn’t even take Kels side ! Made me kind of angry. 😤 
Hello bajamaid . . 
Try asking in the discord. They're very smart from what I've heard and they're most likely be more helpful
ah alright i could try!
# NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! D:. . 
The only good ships are the adult ships. . And kel with a dentist appointment
kel x hector
isn't hector a dog? 😬
or a pet rock
it better be the pet rock
I wasn’t meaning it in a persecution sense and yes it is statistically more likely that basil is straight, just cause it’s more common doesn’t mean it’s cannon. While statistically it’s more likely basil is straight it is still just as much conjecture that he is straight as him being a separate sexuality. I may have phrased it wrong but I’m tired of that statistically more likely one being seen as the “correct”/cannon view. Just cause there’s statistically more right handed people does that mean if it’s not stated they’re left handed they are right handed?
It’s most likely a mix of ship wars and people enforcing head canons as canon
I didn’t even realized Kel’s face in the image 
SAME i only noticed it bc you pointed it out 
NOW I CANT UNSEE IT
You say that like it’s not literally there lmao
Same
HAHAHAHA ONLY SAW IT WHEN YOU MENTIONED IT!
I didn't notice it at first and when I did it was like a jumpscare
Lmao, thank you.
HOW TF DID I ALMOST MISS THAT
Same💀
I didnt even know till I saw this comment 
When I rechecked it to find it I got jumpscared

Same
how tf are we the same???
**OH NO, THE KELPOCLAYPSE'S STARTING TO HAPPEN** 
Kel taught them
I wanna bet 10$ that if you click the article its just says "people liked kel from omori too much"
kel moment 
Omori is the coffee kel is the orange juice
Only Kel will drink this
KEL CHAIN?? 
Kel what have you done
Orange joe with KEL
The army of Kel nukes start to arise, Fear them 
>kel flair. . uh oh
I heard it’s actually not that bad :)
Tell my stomach that and tongue that.
lol
Kel time
Kel moment
K e l
KEL your eyes, you’ll KEL here soon
Ichi ni san shi kel fuuun~
: Shush Kel or the next intervention is for you and your orange joe addiction
 ok then
: \*dehaunts your orange joe\*

‎
. . Tactikel nuke I guess

I like how Kel dislikes thinking too hard
She does good damage but I found kel had best overall health IMO.
what the hell is happening.. . Kel's my glass cannon. . emphasis on the glass.  he dies a lot.  he has the least health.  what the fuck.
Oh hero was the person who died the most on my playthrough. Gave kel and Aubrey all the good stuff
I feel like >!faraway town  present Aubrey also kinda supports it though with her trying to say something and in the optional friend hangout sections she’s always with omori like on the swing set. If your basis on him only holding sunny/omori’s hand is more evidence, again, as far as relationships go I think best friend is still more likely as I only hold my best friends hand and for the most part only hug my best friend. Now again nothing wrong with sunflower especially since I think it’s supposed to be somewhat a self insert protagonist, but I think it’s more likely the cannon for sunburn to happen in the future but ambiguous endings… are ambiguous.!< So write all the fanfics, I’m here for it, just feel sunburn is more likely.
Kel 3 star attack?! Blasphemy! *Kel nuke*
Kel has three stars in attack when he can literally almost one shot bosses
well, i dont think it counts abilities, its just stats,
"dislikes: pickles, cooties, thinking to hard" -kel
No one is safe. Not even kel…
This is terrifying in a way.
Imagine seeing that at night. When it’s dark..

SLENDYKEL
Would be something...
SOMETHING…hmm
 HMMMMM
Agreed.
It feels like he's gonna get up and start walking around
more than one way jesus
. . Yippee
I just realized that sharks really look like airplanes and why. Thanks, u/gaztlygamer64 .
. . Well yeah
Damn...never thought about why they made them into planes
Because a normal shark would be too bland for an alien planet
It looks like it's bouta hit the twin corals
(In coralnese). THERE IS A SECOND SHARK PLANE COMING!
Catfish are planes too 👍. . 
wait what the hell-
F-100 super sabre but catfish 🐟
. . : oh fuck

That was my exact reaction
J A W S U M 
Coolest grandma ever
FR FR 
Wait, so if Kel is real that means the Earth is... CANON
Checkmate “we live in a simulation” mfs
Now we just need kel to disprove flat Earth theory
Knowing kel if a flat earther went up to him and started to talk a little bit kel would be convinced the earth is flat
And you’re so confident in this you had to say it twice.
Glitch idk why but my replies always appear twice for some reason
Prop kel on top of a globe
Knowing kel if a flat earther went up to him and started to talk a little bit kel would be convinced the earth is flat
ZA WARUDO. . 

My face exactly
I think you like Omori. Just a hunch, but maybe it's true.
Just a bit 
no
my favorite part is when she>! falls down the stairs!<
that's cool and all but it's kinda creepy.... . usually plushes like this are of loona or lucario and loona and they're not creepy because they don't look even remotely human . . but this kinda triggers my "uncanny valley sense"? (idk how to call it). . like imagine you go to sleep and he's just sitting in a chair staring at you 
Ahah, yeah I understand why it scares some people, personally I always had high anxiety disorder and my grandma gave me human plush since I was like 4 to sleep correctly so I'm completely used to it I just sleep on those happily lol seeing you guys afraid is kinda funny 😭
> my grandma gave me human plush since I was like 4 . . HUH 
RAAAAH come on by human plush I mean cute plushie but human sized
we need to see the collection of lifeless bodies
Ahah, I have Kel, Sans and Ralsei
SANAS AND RALSEI OML 😭 are their body types accurate or are they stretched
. . Sans Lost a leg but eh-
big sans little sans
I very much want to see the Ralsei
i think its the lack of bones and wrinkles in his limbs
Oh no I'm getting flashbacks of that guy who made a furry plushie that had a fucking wooden, anatomically correct skeleton inside it. There were even rumours of it being a real skeleton
Also the reason why people have real-size plushies of Loona and Lucario...
Now imma copy ur entire bedroom rq
KEL 

I want a Kel 
make one
KEL IS REAL?. . 
Perfect for hiding the bodies. . 
Peak photo
Yooo what? Grandma knows Omori?  Wow-. . But i mean, it’s obvious, every grandma can stitch stuff well, fr- . . But yea ur grandma is cool 
I think she knows it because her grandchild is obsessed with it (note the background of the photo)
Oh- 
 Yeah...
YOOOO KEL’S REAL‼️‼️‼️‼️
1) Your grandma is the best. 2) Why . 3) I love Kel and I'd like to have that but. 4) That life-sized slightly misproportioned Kel scares me
OMG ITS HIM

 very cool grandma
Aubrey is wrong, Kel ain't a gross color.
common grandma W
Your room is crazy cool ngl
When night comes it's gonna stare at u while I sleep like this. . 
You know what? I would not mind like having one of those Kel like things and then I can take them with me everywhere like at the grocery store, the movie theater, the gym, and never be lonely again!
. . KEL REAL?!?
I understand everyone saying he’s creepy cause he do be a bit spooky but uh personally ya know just wondering ah- why did your grandma have this 
She just saw my drawings about him and she decided to make a plush of him since she already makes plushies
Aw thats nice of her 
Sick room, no wonder kel is in it
Hey...Don't say it.... just calm down.....just calm down....
I want all you people to know I've been procrastinating on playing Omori but this post is the thing that has finally convinced me to never play the game :)
I was a little scared of him...
THE KEL. THE KEL IS REAL 
IM SORRY BUT THIS AUDIBLY MADE ME SAY WTF I GOT KEL JUMPSCARED (I do still think it's cool tho!)
I can't pin point it but something about this is creepy...poses the uncanny valley?
W grandma!
kel is real 2401???
That is absolutely insane wow 😭👍
Nice! 
You got great taste in Anime and Gaming, that's for sure  . Also, holy KEL
Horrific giant Kel aside, I love the look of your room! It is so fun!
your room is so cool
Honestly your grandma be slaying Fr fr
I know right ? 
My brain is scaring me, i keep thinking its either some sort of robot or costume
It almost looks like a Kel suit you wear.
I don’t know if I should be impressed or terrified.
Better than a body pillow
That is horrifying.. . And I can't shake the idea of taking out the stuffing and wearing his skin.
I found my next sleep paralysis demon.
Your room is so amazingly decorated!!
I don’t know what to say… 
bro really fucking likes omori 😭
I'm just surprised this was from your grandmother lmao
Please send link, I wanna buy your grandma

I’ve never seen a photo that screamed AUTISM! so hard before…
Ahah, I'm not autistic (I'm not supposed to at least) but I have HPI, hyperfixations and a lot of similar things :)
Update: Just got diagnosed with ADHD....
Hello other ADHD 
yay adhd buddies 

Your grandmas based
HOLY SHIT, I GOTTA GET TO FARAWAY RN
I feel like if someone was inside of it, waiting for the darkness of night to stand up and walk towards you while sleeping.. . Yeah, looks kinda cute, but a bit eerie.
He is already here
Oh jesus.
YOUR GRANDMA IS SO COOL!! I love this kel 😄
Your grandma made that?! That accurately too? No wayy
Where’s the orange joe? *HE’S DYING OF THIRST YOU MONSTE-*
Are you using it as a suit or?
Unrelated , but where have you got your poster ?
That's creepy as fuck
With all due respect OP, it looks uncanny😭
He's so wrinkly 💀

This looks simultaneously a little creepy and really cute. Do you know where she got it?
She made it
Dang! That's awesome!

Grandmas neva suck
Ignore the haters, this is amazing!
kel canon event
Why are his legs not hairy :(
My grandma didn't think about that lol
awww maybe you could mod it and add some hair on his legs, not actual hair like a black thread or unless if your into using actual hair I wouldn't judge
. . Kel real? Like really? For real for real?
Idk if it terrifies me or if i want one too
Wow you REALLY like Omori huh
I LOVE UR ROOM
Your room is now canon. Release him into the wild and make the entire world canon.
I will, I will 
your grandma deserves nothing byt happiness

He already did 💥💥💥

You lucky boy. Hope my grandma was this cool too 
HOLY.FUCKING.SHIT.
Bro became kel

HELPPPPPP
Not funny.
mb you shouldve edited your comment
“Why do people not like me?”
You’re fine man. It’s mostly people being put off by the joke ruining the moment. The post was meant to be wholesome. It was a gift from their grandmother.
Grandma knows his son is long lost 
Why does this seem so suspicious to me?
BC you're weird
Yeah.... . Maybe.... . . . Maybe.
But kel is more weird
This isn't gonna end well
cut a hole in it
No please, she just enjoyed my posts and wanted to surprise me, don't make this cute plush made by a cute grandma weird 
"My grandma" yeah fucking right, you bought that off etsy you pervert

Good.
If the squad is assembled the earth is doomed

Every day this subreddit strays further from god
This is super cool but incredibly terrifying, I would not stay in a room with him
There’s a person in there

I'm really scared
Where did she get it???? Did she make it??? Can I apply to be her new grandchild/j???
This is so freaking creepy

Least obsessed omori fan
DUDE IM SCARED OF THAT KEL... LIKE, Cute that ur grandma did it for you, BUT... UHJJB 

Kle Omogi
I think it's weird sleeping with kel but I'll don't judge
***IT IS HIM***  . . . ***IT IS TIME FOR REJOICING***. . &#x200B;. . ***KEL HATH RETURNED***
 omori is taking over.
wat
How can it be so terrifying, yet somewhat wholesome 
Sleep paralysis demon. ......🤢🤢🤢🤢i love kel. But this scares me.
Kel 
Man, even Kel writes more understandably than me
Kel seems like the type to try and write his name in one stroke Like this. . 
HC: Kel can't read cursive, but also writes like this
I got the same handwriting as Kel o-o
There are chances you're, in fact, Kel
I'm European though o-o. . Italian, in fact.
Then, you might be Italian Kel Edit: now imagine him and Peppino fighting Giorno's gang
That is actually a very interesting plot idea.
You mean you also write a smiley face instead of period? No way dude
I feel like Kel holds a pen/pencil like how we all held it when we were 5 years old.

Yeah.... 5 years old....
i feel like kel would write his name in all caps
Kel writes weirdly neat….
Lmao it reminds me when I was younger I loved wrting my surname and not my entire name and the teacher was soooo mad (Kel's entire name is Kelsey so I relate more Kel XD)
. . this is their canon (probably?) handwriting (except for kel’s)
Kel :>
Kel :)
Kel would 100% have the hand-writing of a sweet potato though.
i feel like Kel and Aubrey would be switched, with Kel keeping the smile
I write like KEL 
Kel :)
kel just like me fr 
Kel is literally me omg
KEL :)
Kel would write names without the big letter lol
Kel :>
Nah Kel would write like an animal
Kel
Kel would not have legible handwriting
Can we talk about kel getting 47cm in 4 years ?
It's not insane. I managed to grow 12 something centimetres in a single year.
Yeah, but four years in a row
Yep, that's kind of crazy, but I think it makes sense for fiction to exaggerate this thing. . . Kel's newfound massive height does two things. Make a case on why he got into basket, or was a byproduct of that. And enchances that gap between Sunny and him, due to the ladder's athletic lifestyle and the first one's stasis.
Not really, I'm 15 and I'm 5'7. Seems like Kel and Hero's heights could be family height, on top of the fact that Kel is a year older, but Kel's height may still be a bit unrealistic for a 16 years old. Aubrey might be taller than the average for a girl, but she's not too unrealistically tall, some girls get tall.. . Also, in the defense of Kel's height, I have a brother who is 17, and a brother who is 20, and desire them both being unrealistically tall, my 17 years old brother is even taller than my 20 years old brother
Also,  Kel has >! coped with Mari's death the best so less stress to him !< and great physical health.
kel is a year older?
The game straight up tells us that Kel is ridiculously tall, going into her respective fight, Kim mentions that "size isn't everything." Also Kel himself makes a big deal of height and wanting to be the taller brother.
>KEL - 6’2. . Imagine Kel's height after 4 years. . . Him getting drafted into the NBA is canon now.
The point guard the Lakers need
Christ, kel had a growth spurt of 1’4 foot or nearly half a meter.
Kel was drinking orange joe
In defense of Kel, Hero's hair seems to be slightly taller, so not counting hair Kel might actually be the taller brother.
And besides, Kel has grown much more than Hero has in 4 years, implying that Kel's growth is accelerating at an exponential rate (Obviously)
wtf was kel eating in those 4 years
Orange joe
Burger
Puberty
puberty hit kel
Well aubery is somewhat tall for women standards (5’6). . Hero(6’3) and kel(6,2) are tall, which is expected. Kel had a growth spurt of of fricking 48 centimeters, which is almost half a meter.. . Sunny and basil are (5’4), which is pretty short for males.
Why not? He's taller than Kel and Kel plays basketball.
Bitch I'm 14 and I'm literally 190cm
You just simply can't accept it
Its completely normal, I have a FEMALE friend who's 16 and 190 cm
And I have FEMALE friend who is 220 cm at 16. . . What tf is wrong with this guy.
>Mommy??? . . That's TALL
Not the tallest person I know. . . We have this one guy in our class, who is 231 cm. Pretty insane if you ask me. . . Considering I'm just 185 myself.
i am 16 years old and i am 184 cm tall and i have friends my same age who are over 190 so i would say it is very possible
Eh it is possible.
Okay it is very rare but I'm sure it's not IMPOSSIBLE. I still think they are kinda shorter, but they still have more than 180cm.
Well, this explains how Kel was owning all of the real world kids, bro is almost 2 meters and athletic af
HEADSPACE:Kel is one of the smallest of the group. Real world:Kel is the taller of the group
That Orange Joe-Milk combo really hypercharges bone growth
The first time I saw this I thought it was inches so I was like HOW THE HELL IS KEL 15 FEET TALL but then I realized it was in centimeters. Also I never realized Kel has leg hair.
What the fuck do you mean with kel being 190 at 16
GOD **DAMN** ***IT***, HS/DW KEL'S HEIGHT IS 143, THAT NUMBER FOLLOWS ME EVERYWHERE!!!  . 
..i'm shorter than kel.. . damn.
Geez, I did not know Kel was that tall… . . He’s even taller than me! And trust me, I’m pretty tall.
KEL CANT BE TALLER THAN ME FUUUUUCK
I'm taller than all these kids, lmao bring it, no kel nuke will save you now
With the growth rate of a bit more than 10 cm/year, Kel is an absolute unit.
WHY IS KEL SO TALL
I appreciate that Kel has leg hair
my question is how the hell kel grew nearly 50 cm in 4 years???
kel is taller than me by an inch. yeah i quit
Damn, kel is 190??? Who raised this monster 
Kel is a giant
As a 14 year old girl I'm as tall as kel
Kel needs those 2 cms
i want kel now
Kelro scares me.
K e l r o s s s s s   c o m i n g. . r u n
add a kel

i called him trauma cuz i didnt want to devipher his personality as i am not sure what exactly he really is without those hallucinations and suicidal thoughts   . and kel's simplicity makes him better but in terms of character writing i think aubery is better
 🙏  .   . Kel prays for you
Thank you kel. My bank account is forever grateful
It’s a crossover, so it’s likely going to be narrated by Alice instead, just like Aloy’s.
He plays the violin like he did in the duet, making the enemies cry and stunning them
Actually, it’s more of a cc, yeah it’s keeping them in place by making them sad but it also lowers their def and increases their resistance so you can keep wailing at them. . Plus that sweet sweet atk scaling swirl damage Relapse does makes Sucrose look actually weak
This isn’t a thing though. . Is it?
Thank you for these instructions, I will be trying this on my Kel plush once he arrives
You... bought the Kel plush? EVERYONE! GET EM!!!
I got one too.  how much time do I have to run?
Hmmm, a few hours. =>
I got one in the first minute💀
I got one in the first 5 minutes. If ypu wanted a plush you shoulda been there the second they were available fr
I was at the site WAITING 😭
KEL has suffered severe physical trauma*
Kel vs Agumon
>!relax. The games story is unrealistic. In my experience siblings are very likely to survive being pushed down the stairs!<
 in your experience??
Yup. >!he was just standing at the top of the staircase not moving, so I tried to nudge him outta the way, causing him to tumble down to the floor below!<
i fall down my 13 stair staircase all the time and im fine lmao
>!Now put some splintered wood at the bottom and give them a few minutes on the jumprope!<
>!Honestly though, those stairs aren't really long enough to kill somebody!<
you just havent been trying hard enough
Delete "I think" and you're most likely right.
The idea of a depressed Kel shutting himself off from the world ends me.
I mean, Sunny would manage to bring Kel outside tho
ahh hell nahhh
*Hikikel AU intensifies*
Kel: “Man, Hero’s death has really messed me up”. . Sunny: “In that case, I diagnose you with... **puberty!**”. . Kel: “Bro wtf?”
big kel 6
STOPPP SO ACCURATE — kel as fred
Well in MBTI(jung( or whoever ”made” them) cognitive functions) they have pretty similar types aka how their minds or thinking works which also most likely affects their personality. So they’re similar, yeah. Both have Fe, Ni, Se and Ti.. . . 🧐
Kel's gonna rock out the ontamatone when fighting himself 
I need Kel 
BC : Good idea!…but I’m currently restricted by what that monochromatic goblin puts as rules, because too much suspicious activities, and…poof! The chance of a deal is more gone then >!this poor sap’s sister! haha!!< The only reason I got good ol cheese dip is because I lured him in with the promise of giving something, if the kid thinks I stole something, he’s less likely to listen to me! It’s possible, but…let’s *Mable* that for another time!. . (that’s probably ooc but i’ve never written Bill Cipher lmao.)
Alright how about this. The kids been eating expired steak for the past four years. Get him an actual meal. Some real gourmet shit
\- Kel
can i have the kel one
Update : even 2 days after watching this video , i can say this video still has me in a tight chokelock , i watched all of his videos , and they also really helped so i reccommend u watch the "dealing with grief" playlist of his vidos , hes a very strong person from what i can tell and il say again , may he find peace and his daughter rest in eternal peace
Kel died for our sins in r/place. Thus making him canonically Jesus.
I remember there being another Kel at one point. I hope he wasn’t deleted :(
I saw a hidden kel somewhere too

Don't worry young Kel. . IM HERE 
Don't let Kel know-
I already do.
it's Kellin' time
kel moment 
The KEL is coming....
Or maybe not, since it's Kel's opinion
But Kel, that means it's canon.
It's now canon that it's Kel's opinion
This causes a paradox, making it explode.
The entire planet when Kel spins the globe like nobody's business. . 
I am the storm that is aproaching!!!! 
Wouldnt it be day and night yoo fast?
According to scienceabc.com, days would become shorter, gravity would stop working, large parts of the earth would become flooded, hurricanes and tornadoes would appear more frequently, and massive earthquakes would tear the earth's crust apart.. . However, the speeds used in the article are still very small compared to the speed the earth would be spinning at here. I think this would just immediately kill everyone.
Might be a nitpick, but one frame of Kel's eye is open in the third gif.
Oh, I thought you were talking about the weird-looking ice animation. Kel's eye being open in one frame is copied from the original sprite. I think he's supposed to be looking at the ball while he's spinning it, but it does look a little akward at a high speed.
The ice animation's fine.
One of my friends suggested Kel spinning his head around like an owl for some reason. . ^(Also, I love these!! They look great! ^^)
That's the exact kind of oddly specific stuff I was hoping for.. . I'll make these requests when I have the time, but it might take a little while until I do.
Are you talking about my request or kitty warrior's?
Both. I'll create the requests I'm able to make, and then probably share them all in a single post.
Kel breaking like a Lego figure.
Do you mean "him breaking to pieces, like what would happen if you dropped a poorly-made LEGO build", or "his head, torso and legs coming apart, like what happens if you die in a LEGO video game"
KEL has become GOD
Mr. Outback does say Headspace is 33.000 years old, which appears to inexplicably be a reference to the Bible. It all makes sense now...
A program named "Piskel", which was the first result when I googled something like "free pixel animation maker". . Piskel isn't perfect. It seems to be missing some features you'd probably see in more high-end programs, and it can't handle long animations like Ice Aubrey very well, but it's good for a free tool. I certainly couldn't find anything better that didn't cost a lot of money, at least.. . I used www.redketchup.io/color-picker to get the right hues for the sprites. I got the spritesheets from the Xbox Game Pass version of the game, where there's literally just a folder in the PC version with PNGs of all the sprites.
Are you using a PC? If so, I suggest GraphicsGale. It has a lot of features and is free! I used it a lot and is great until you get something like Aseprite (Aseprite is not free unless you know how to compile source code).
I haven't heard of that. I'll check it out.
Did tou find it? :)
Yeah, but I haven't gotten the chance to try it out yet. It's still being updated fairly frequently though, which is usually a good sign for stuff like this.
Kel is ballin’ the world
I used a program named Piskel to make the actual edits, and www.redketchup.io/color-picker to get the right hues for the sprites. I got the spritesheets from the Xbox Game Pass version of the game, where there's literally just a folder in the PC version with PNGs of all the sprites.. . Piskel doesn't work very well for long animations though. Another commentor told me GraphicsGale is a good program, but I haven't tried that yet.
kel holds thee world
Kel. . 
Kel makes the world go round
KEL is powerful he has the earth
this proves that kel is god, he keeps the world spinning
I hope we can make it a safe spot for hector too:3 on kels head of course
Yeah but all this wholesomeness is kinda ruined by Kel grabbing the FUCK SPEZ flag lol. I am outside the drama so it might not be that bad but just the thought of participating to it kinda ruins wholesomeness
I think its in character with kel, he waving an offensive flag when everyone is chilling, he would surely wave the butt certificate to show everyone xd
BLASPHEMY, I WOULD BUY HER >!if i had money after buying Kel's....!<
That implies you bought multiple
No...sadly i could only get my hands on one, i guess someone beat me to it
Hmm, whoever could of done that...  *looks around nervously*
Ikr, what a cruel person . . *Shoves plushies behind me*
Yep he was pretty much the first to be sold out along with Kel 
this is how i learn that the plushies came out and i missed kel 🧍‍♀️

Seriously though, the fact FnaF and Undertake were even ABLE to recover gives me a little hope that maybe… just maybe… if the unlikelihood of shit hitting the fan does happen, we can recover… or we end up like Cooking Companions and Spooky’s Jumpscare Mansion where new people coming into the fanbase did Jack shit and they remained just as sweet as they were before they reached mainstream.
Yeah even if we do get overrun. It's not a total loss, we've sacrificed our fandom for the greater good. Ensuring other fandom's safety. It means we will go on to live as one of the many fandoms who sacrificed themselves for other community's like FNF and Fortnite.
Ayo, shout out to Fortnite though, that fanbase has been holding its fort (heh, fort=Fortnite heheheh) for half a decade now and its never lost one shimmer of cringe or toxicity.
Yeah they have been taking taking the toxic fan blows for other community's for like 5 years and still manage too survive even if its by the skin of its teeth, such  bravery and strength had only been exerted by the TF2 fanbase back in their prime until them
kel named finger
yeah, every post is just k e l. . dont get me wrong, i like kel, hes my favorite character, BUT HES NOT THE ONLY CHARACTER!!
What do you mean Kel isn't the Only Character in Omori?????. . Have i been wrong this whole time?????
Y'all it isn't gatekeeping, it's just saying the sub will likely change a lot with the new people. Sounded a little aggressive though
Kel is superman?? . . What next? Lois Lane is Luz Noceda?
Omg lol. Fun to see TOH jokes outside of their reddits
Did not expect a TOH joke here
Not really? I knew about Pretty Boy and whatshisface--y'know, Kel's friend--but I didn't even know this comic existed
kel omori real
it was most likely a joke
Kel is angry because he wants Orange Joe and not Wendy's
Omori is happy because he loves Wendy’s
Kel nuke him, he won't survive a single second
Now kel is smol forever
Sadly not. If you get a combination of Kell and Omori’s drink you could make it though.
No, because the Japanese would see omori as おもり and hikkomori as ひきこもり which is more different of a word than it is similar. The "o" is actually part of the character "ko" and so the two words only seem like they have the same ending that a lot of words do. They would more likely read omori and think おおもり which is just a place name in Tokyo meaning big forest.
I see, didn't know about the "big forest" thing
Kel peeking behind the food. Watch out he might throw something
 I think kel
Really there is a reason to love or hate every single character . . except kel everyone loves kel
im not a fan of headspace kel
I can see that but real world kel for sure everyone loves him and if you don’t then you do no qualify as human
Yea this is weird. Headspace Kel is a huge jerk and a bit of a bully, but in the real world he is precious and Aubrey grew into being the bully.
Quiet bookish kid remembers outgoing friend in unflattering light: news at 11.
Girl with dyed hair doesn't have a father: more after this break
well, neither does Omori anymori
ANYMORI--
hhhhhh why is this so funny 😂😂
No sister? 🤨
I love being sub-human.
I understand that, he’s basically just an immature child, and a kind of annoying one at that.. But you shouldn’t hate a child for being a child, you hate them if they grow up and continue being a child :)
Yeah
Kel is kinda pushy and can make people uncomfortable sometimes, but he's a nice guy
Yeah that's just the facts.
I have some unfortunate news for you.
\[Joking\] I will skin you alive . . in all seriousness we all have our own opinions.
Same but /srs
Woah dude the hell? 
Your sentence is damnation to the bear cage
Sploon
\*pokes bear\*
Factually inaccurate, I hate Kel with a burning passion.
Why?
He's annoying + I'm sick of the fandom's obsession with him.
You will be terminated
Dreamworld hector
i love kel so much i would die for him in headspace and in faraway
I dislike kel lmao, I don't hate him or his fans though I'm just tired of kel being everywhere lol. I love both Aubrey and basil, though I'm biased to Aubrey because I love sad fucked up girls who are misunderstood
"Just because you did something bad doesn't make you bad" -Kel.. . &#x200B;. . Pro tip try not to hate on someone just because of their faults.
True, which is why i am now going to hide bombs in the school bathrooms
hey im selling pomz-2 russian anti-personnel mines at a reduced price, just $.50 each
may I buy too
im also selling tm-35 and tm-46 anti tank mines for around $25 and $30
do you have any anti-omorb mines for sale? I need to deal with some enemy omorbinators in a random war about some plant or smth idk
is ormorbin' time

True, which is why I'm off to drunk drive in a school zone
"Just because you did something bad doesn't make you bad" mfs when I murder their entire family in front of them (doesn't make me bad)
Tbh the message is both true and not true.. . If you push someone down the stairs in terror and anger but not out of malice or intent=Good will/mistake(accident).. . &#x200B;. . If you shoot someone or knock them out with a bat killing them with the intent to hurt=Bad/Not a mistake/intentional.
With all do respect:. . >!He saw his friend push his sister, who was also his friend, down the stairs. Now, this is a troubling situation for him to be in and I won’t act like there is a right answer. Telling someone’s parents or calling 911 could have been good options, but it’s understandable that the panic made him not think of this immediately. There are certainly wrong answers though, and I would argue framing it as a suicide almost instantly is one of them!<
I think you're missing the point the game is trying to make
yes because faults are pushin someone into a lake and tormenting a poor kid for like 4 years and proceeding to have my group of friends gang up on the kid who lost his sister. yes, faults.
"Just because you did something bad, doesn't make you a bad person" mfs when I traumatise that person and their friends for the rest of their live and also peel their eye off(I'm not a bad person and not a good person, you just don't understand)
I don’t hate him because of his faults, he’s just super annoying and reminds me of someone I knew who was also annoying
\-Which is exactly what he did in RW.
As a Kel stan, I fucking love balls 🥰🥰
As a balls stan, I fucking love Kel 🥰🥰
Yea I just dont buy the good ending. Yes, that is canonically what happened, I just personaly cant believe a redemption for any of the characters in the span of three days (except for kel cause he really didnt do anything that horrible)
enraged kel is such a silly lad
kel goes from "stop it dude" to "you have 2 minutes to live."
Ye i see what you mean! I am generally quite a passionate person and i am super invested in this story and characters so it personally makes me find it quite easy to hate or adore a character, but again that's me personally.. . also i agree with the kel quote to a certain extent. like if you do a bad thing and didnt mean to, or didnt intend for it to be malicious, you arent a bad person, but i personally fully believe aubrey had bad intentions when bullying basil, pushing him into the lake, threatening and instigating physical altercations with both sunny and kel, which is something that makes me dislike her.
this is why kel
My man Kel looks like he stole a picnic blanket cause all his shirts were in the dirty hamper...
he'd so do that oh my god
"Goddamn- Kel, why are you wearing Mari's picnic blanket?". "Why was it under your bed?". "...Touche."
LMFAO
Sorry, its The Xbox gaming fridge update where Kel just vibes and you cant do anything
Sorry to break it to you, but that’s not a leak. It’s just cut content.. . They could use the content in the future, but it’s not a leak and most likely won’t be used.
Kel accidentally throws a basketball at the board and everyone’s placement gets randomized
Cool idea-. . Happy cake day btw!
Kel also joins the board and moves to any free square each turn (cannot capture or be captured)

i'm sorry but a serious title screen with just **KEL** would make me lose it
. . it's real, it was an april fools thing
We need a kel mod you are correct I can’t code tho lol
when (if) they restock im getting kel too cause his outfit would be hilarious on them
I ordered the whole set except Kel (cuz he was sold out), I was literally in at less than two hours when they released on the shop, let that sink in; Kel got sold out within less than two hours.
The worst part of this is that some parent thought kids under 13 weren't old enough to watch a skeleton 💀
A skeleton with nuts
Didn't know Space-boyfriend had skeletons in his closet
Kel is here. . This is canon
Omg yessssss!! Kel is just like Rainbow Dash!!!!1! x3
Kel’s dog looks like doge! 😂
hey i just ed finished Omori doesn’t kel’s dog look like the funny doge image
Kel so funny XD
will kel haz chezborger?! 
Wow, omori was an awesome game! I saw kel and how sporty he was and was like, do you even lift bro? Hahaha, I’m gonna go play the tutorial world on Minecraft console edition for fun because YOLO
kel dabbed
My favorite character is Kel because he's le epic XD
Kel is derp
Heard they’re gonna make a new Spider-Man movie without Tobey! Omori and Kel would def prefer Tobey, they aren’t gonna fall for this faker!
Yo Kel stinks like Updog in there
LOL ROFL KEL DABBED!!!
kel really said “cut my life into pieces”
This is my **Last Resort**

Do Kel cracking his neck and doing the Family Guy death pose
I still have the last request from the first post to make, and I have a few other things I want to try making afterwards first, but I will get to the new requests eventually.. . That being said, [half of this has already been made.]()
I used Piskel, which is the best free program I could find. I've had someone suggest GraphicsGale and Aseprite too, but GraphicsGale was too complicated for me to figure out (although it's clearly quite technically advanced if you do know what you're doing), and Aseprite costs money.. . Piskel has a very simple, clear UI, and is really easy to use, even for someone like me with absolutely no experience in pixel art. It's not particularly well-optimized though, and may run slowly or even crash on long or complicated sprites. I could give you a full list of downsides I've encountered, but that's probably more information than you want.
I'll try it out, thanks for the advise
Ah yes, everyone knows Kel's hobbies of spinning his head around 360° and shattering to pieces.
Oh no! My Kel! He’s broken!
Just glue him back together, he'll be fine.
Welp, better get the Gorilla Glue.
Someone already asked this, so I'll just copy that comment.. . I used Piskel, which is the best free program I could find. I've had someone suggest GraphicsGale and Aseprite too, but GraphicsGale was too complicated for me to figure out (although it's clearly quite technically advanced if you do know what you're doing), and Aseprite costs money.. .

I could give you a full list of downsides I've encountered, but that's probably more information than you want.
I like to imagine the Kel one with the table breaking sound from "Oh no! Out table! It's broken!"
You might want to ask her if she’s played the “Omori” route. Omori has two different routes that have entirely different endings and expand the entirety of the Headspace(a major location in the game) and opens up a new version of the Blackspace(one of the final important areas in the game) called Blackspace 2.. . It’s easy to never get this route so I figured I should mention it, if she hasn’t played it and would like to after hearing about it then just tell her “don’t open the door for Kel” and then there’ll be a lot of extra content after the last few areas.
My only source is a popular Kel meme... But we all know those are canon.. . Also, just look at the guy.
Hm? I don't get it.
Well, it's a common saying in this fanbase that every Kel meme should be considered canon... And in one of them, the piece of information I wrote was mentioned.. . Above all, it's just a joke, though.
I understood that, still thanks for the explanation. I didn't get that 'Also, look at the guy' part.
Yeah, that was the more unfunny part of the joke. >!Stereotypically, people considered to be "blonde twinks" tend to be into that stuff, but that's a major generalisation, and even if it wasn't, it wouldn't have been that funny to begin with...!<
Again thanks for the explanation. And no, I found it kind of funny to be honest.
Isn't he and Kel about the same height?
Height chart says no
lol not at all. towards the end of the game there's a picture of sunny, kel, hero, and aubrey, and kel is significantly taller
No, Kel is just invading her personal space and smells of BO and Orange Soda.
I'd feel like she'd murder him instead of blushing
Give it about 5 seconds.
She has the same reaction when he drank expired Orange Joe. It's probably sheer bafflement, if anything
She didn't want to ruin the photo. Kel's face will be ruined afterwards, though.
yeah she seems uncomfortable to me
Cause the one bed is in a garbage dump, and  the other is where kel sleeps in
or in a more accurate sense, sunny memorized it and somehow connected it to kel. i’m now very curious on what’s behind this

Kel is likely Mexican and eats lots of cilantro
: cilantro mi casita
What Japanese words?
from the Japanese word "Hikkikomori"
Is that racially motivated??

I'm also Mexican. . I didn't say anything about other Hispanic cultures because I don't know much about them
I was joking
Kel is the type of guy to know bunch of useless facts. He's the "fun fact" guy of the group.
Hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia is a fear of long words. . ^(this comment was made by the kel gang)
Aibohphobia is the fear of palyndromes. . \- KEL
Loopapyrophobia is the fear of toilet paper. . - also KEL
Just one more letter and aibophobics would be afraid of it. But why do fears of different parts of vocabulary exist?
fuck, you're right. I forgot the 'H' lol
: That's kinda counter-productive... . : Or ironic!. . : or just flat out stupid.
i thought it was fear of hippopotamus

Gotta count them calories 💪
That's just something you can do when you come from a Hispanic household. I, also, know the nutrition information for cilantro.

Kel is the type of guy to read the cereal box when he's bored
this comment right here ^
It looks like a mistake as Omori always comments on the foe facts and he always does it first.
Oh right, I think the only times I remember he didn’t were for Download Window (which just says [ERROR]) and Big Strong Tree (funnily enough, Kel comments instead)
I think you're misreading it, it's Omori listing the information and then Kel also has a quote to offer below the information.
Why does it not say - Omori then?
ur reaching buddy
>ay - O. . it said that because of this lol
owned
close
you'll be here soon
u/boten fight me >:D
Yeah that's a good point, I looked over the Foe facts again and it seems like Omori consistently is noted as the "author", so you're probably right
Let’s be honest, Kel is likely a genius, but only about things that don’t really matter and are just offhand facts 
Kel is probably a high INT low WIS character
So a himbo
Never reply to any of my comments ever again. . Consider this a digital restraining order
DON'T ACT LIKE I'M WRONG!!!
RESTRAINING ORDER!!! REDDIT POLICE HELP IM BEING HARRASSED /joke
YOU WILL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE COPPERS!!! *Jump out a window*
He’s Mexican 100%
Of course he does
Kel’s the group athlete, right? Maybe he knows this stuff so he can maximize his gains and height!
Potas- 🍌
And you don't?
Cool Kel Fact 
TIL that vitamin K and potassium aren't the same thing
I wish more ppl read the foes fact book. It genuinely had some funny things in it 
GOOD GOD 😨
Wheres this from?
Foe Facts! I highly recommend checking it out, it’s hilarious and provides insight into the characters’ personalities not seen elsewhere (especially Omori’s)
holy fuck i played the game twice and never read those
He what?
Ackchewally, that's the nutrition information of coriander.
Im not surprised hes sporty gotta know the nutrition of veggies
Kel's name confirmed to be Cilantro, assumed the Identity of a child who went missing 10 years ago. DNA tests confirm that Cilantro is Basil's brother
The pair have been arrested for Identity Theft, Aiding and Abetting, Fraud
the real question is does Kel think cilantro tastes like soap
kel moment
Well if you make a meme situation with a friend cosplaying Kel and you cosplaying Sunny, both of you will be canonically Kel and Sunny b'cuz every Kel meme is canon.
I need to find a Kel !!
They know arguing is useless, if the kel appears. Its canon.
Really? I thought it was established they both likes each other and thus was most likely…
Knowing Kel, it either means he'd wear them to stand taller, or eat them to grow taller.
Ngl, we could probably change Kel to all men in general, really. . . (I promise I'm not projecting.... but I also wouldn't say no to an extra foot)
i'm in the height sweet spot speak for yourself
"Height sweet spot?" Brudda, have you seen NBA players? There's no such thing as a "sweet spottt"
well i'm about the same height as everyone i know except the giants but i'm STILL like an inch or two taller than those everyone i know guys
You can’t take about your height this much without at least giving us a number lol
6'0
wow you really are in the sweet spot damn
Yeah that’s perfect height lol I’m 5’10 and I feel like I’m average to everyone but never taller
Ha! 6'1.
i said i like being at "protagonist height". . see? i can spin everything around to be a good thing.
there’s cons to being tall though. Me being a part of the tall society, the main issue is:. . B A C K   P R O B L E M S
rip. hope ya get taller!
Funny thing is, High heels are actually original worn by men in Europe to imply higher status in around 17th century
Sweet! 5'8 upper class here I come!
It might be because of Kel's jealousy that Hero is taller than him, and that they compare heights often, so Sunny might just think that Kel wishes to be as tall as possible.
Definitely eat them
Kel is the type of guy to count shoes height with your own height
Kels… So many Kels…
HEY DELETE YOUR MESSAGE AND CHANGE IT TO KEL
Guess it’s time for me to draw Kel in heels now 
Honestly, I was kinda hoping this post would inspire some fanarts 
kel is going to be looking very sassy with those heels
Kel is secure enough in his gender identity to lead his friends to believe he’s open to femininity
The problem isn't femininity, the problem is that wearing heels is hell 
okay you right tho. I tried walking in thrift store heels for the first time some months ago and it’s incredible how hard it is
r/SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTOP. . also kel might wear those just to be the tallest of the group. . edit: u/Flint675 YOU MADE A SUBREDDIT I WASNT PLANNING TO ACTUALLY BE MADE THIS HAS HAPPENED TWO TIMES NOW. . edit 2: STOP MAKING MY SUBREDDITS REAL PLEASE

jokes on you im into that
w-w-what
you know what happened
yea
Let’s be honest Kel probably won 13 seasons of Rupaul’s drag race so this is not a surprise
that is not a sentence i ever expected to read but ok sure this is what were doing now
why is that so surreal yet so true
ironic because it increases attack and lowers speed which is the opposite of what kel wants
ironically very bad for kel stat wise 
That makes it that much funnier imo
KEL has unleashed his inner material gworl
nah, kel would look great in heels
Kel is the original drag queen.
real
Kel: Wanna dress up like ladies?. . Sunny: Wouldn't that make us... *fruity*?. . Kel: What's the matter? Scared you might like it?
Waiting for those „Kel trans cannon” confirmed guys/girls/whatever
You don't have to be trans to be gorgeous in heels  
Absolutely true
At some point in his life Kel becomes a metalhead and wears giant shoes on giant platforms
idk i interpreted it as kel having a thing for people who wear high heels
Kel is egg confirmed /j
Girlypop Kel yass 💕
Headcanon: Kel used to wear heels so he could be tall and reach the basketball hoop. It backfires eventually 
Kel slayed
Kel would never wear those. They pad his ability to nuke.
kel sounds rlly stupid so i guess they would establish a communist party in america

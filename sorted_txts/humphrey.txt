>!I forget which battle it was, but one time, I got the "Omori did not succumb." message twice. I think it was Humphrey.!<
It's a glitch that can happen if you heal the same turn you got the "Omori did not succumb" message
The ability is called Plot Armor, I believe. If you heal around 10% or more hp on the same turn, you get it back
Huh
Same, I'm really glad I made myself not look up the game at all online until I completed it. (>!ok fine I looked up a guide to defeat humphrey because FUCK that guy!<)
Oh god. That thing killed me while I was running from the cat experiment in Humphrey. I’ll never forget that fear
Well congratulations! You had a WTF value of at least 8! That's rare! 
Or perhaps she follows Humphrey logic… but if that were true, wouldn’t that mean Headspace is actually her… you know what, just forget I said anything.
Expand your mind, Omori!
Expand!
Is her… 🤨
That and the fact that the whole game's plot revolves around depression and self-hatred. . . And the fact that Humphrey sometimes straight-up drops an f-bomb.
"I FUCKING LOVE AIR CONDITIONING!". . The WTF Value is an absolute gem, and I love it so much, it just makes the game a lot funnier with unexpected F Bombs.. . ...Y'know, I'd love to see an OMORI Randomizer now.
On wtf value 13
Suggestive Themes? What was.... . *Humphrey PTSD flashbacks ensue*. . ...ah.
im omori and i fap and play old games
Humphrey really is just too powerful.

Where is the air conditioner and humphrey
In its own pile.
The blessed ship pile, that is
Not just blessed, but godly. Who would dare to question the bond between Humphrey and air conditioning?
The people who mix the pile, that’s who
i bet humphrey cosplayers really fucking loved the air conditioning
We all fucking love air conditioning.
I'm a Humphrey cosplayer and I indeed do fucking love air conditioning
I’m pretty sure for the longest time, at least over here in Europe, the game had been sitting at Pegi 16. It was only on the week the console release was taking place that they upped it to Pegi 18. I want to assume Humphrey had something to do with it
Yeah they literally upped the rating because of that one phrase that only appears with a chance and is a one off. . But the game also has su!c!de, self hate, depression and they be like: "I sleep" LOL double standards
It would've been rated e for everyone but Humphrey says fuck
I relate to humphrey
Haha Humphrey your air conditioning is awesome.
Are you really the real Humphrey?
Yes. . Also do you fucking love air conditioning because i fucking love air conditioning
I fucking love air conditioning, but i dont fucking love being mentally ill and stigmatized
I do love fucking air conditioning how could I not
You can get a gender change potion from Medusa (I think) on Omori route after you feed Humphrey.  . It only works outside of battles and wears off each time you enter one. But you can actually enter the women toilet room while it works.
I googled it and wtf you're right
A finger of the monkey's paw curls.... . Humphrey coral castle mashup poi that takes up a fourth of the map 😈. . 
Even worse. . A lousy creative mode map and nothing else
r/SuddenlyHumphrey
Wait til you get to Humphrey... That's the section I hated the most
I'll tell Humphrey to eat you again 
I'll beat the sweets out of you peasant
How is Humphrey supposed to have something to fucking love now?!
***rips across time and space to bring the modern technology of Omori to Tevyat***. . There you go, Humphrey. Now everyone in Tevyat can enjoy air conditioning as much as you!
I fucking love air conditioning
then marry it, (HAH he’s never going to ac-)
I, Humphrey, take you, Air conditioning, to be my wife (or husband), to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part, according to God's holy law, in the presence of God I make this vow.
… Bad, you’re bad, you’re **EF1FHBRVUJ**-
Oh I thought it was "Humphrey" before reading the entire thing. Kinda feel dumb now
Omg- I wonder if there's any fixed release date yet. I hope they don't leave out the extra headspace stuff, Since things like Otherworld, Humphrey, Etc. are important to the story. like, REALLY important.
Humphrey is gate keeping the game from children
humphrey >!fucking loves air conditioning!<
yeah. after humphrey, if you go back and interact with it, the tire swing disappears and a spider cat something appears if you go out of the room and enter it again
After humphrey the game always ends because I get the last key. Do I just leave one of the keys so i can go back and explore ?
i beat the game at level 27, humphrey was a little tough
I mean, common sense says you don't climb into a gigantic being that could become hungry at any second.
h umphre
Where Humphrey
>! His fight was so annoying with how he summoned a gator literally every turn. Don't even get me started on humphrey.!<
Lol yes. Humphrey is the fight I'm stuck on!
Thanks Humphrey! We can always rely on you!
Normalize buff Humphrey
yes
Does one of the humphreys actually say this? i remember them talking about air conditioning but i might have just not noticed this one
Yeah, it has to do with your WTF value
You can fight roboheart in the normal route??? HOW. Spoiler warning (for omori route): I didn't know this and I've already played past finishing Humphrey :(. Can you still fight her >!when humphrey resurfaces in the omori route??!<
yes she's still there
omg yayyyyy. . Thank for the reply! :))
I’m not very sure, since I only found out about them after joining the community. I think you go back to humphrey when you’re looking for your last hangman keys?
>!The slime sisters make them, in front of you, as part of progressing the Humphrey questline in Deeper Well. How did you miss that?!<
You’re right, but I forgot about it so it’s definitely not memorable that way lol
No, they’re in Humphrey
Bruh i went theough humphrey and i never fought them
Mutantheart, Perfectheart, and Roboheart are all optional bosses in the Hikikomori route
Ah so they are in the bad ending, thats why i never got them, gotcha
how would you symbolize her “death” being swallowed by Humphrey?
There’s another comment on this thread linking to a post that suggests Humphrey might be representative of Sunny’s overwhelming emotions, so uh, with that interpretation, that tracks very well
i always figured Humphrey as a representation of Sunny's guilt literally swallowing him whole, sinking him deeper and deeper no matter how hard he struggles. notice how *only when* he defeats Humphrey in Headspace does he gain access to Blackspace (assuming you found the other keys) to confront the truth. its like in a sense, Humphrey IS the final boss of Headspace, as only by Sunny willing to face his trauma can he climb out of his four years of guilt and regret that has swallowed him.
Oh I’m making no judgements, this is all speculation of course. Sometimes The Curtains Are Just Blue. It’s fun to overanalyse though.
>!She almost died in Humphrey!<
She fed Humphrey
*humphrey*
Humphrey f——ing loves air conditioning
The cat is still one of the three great creatures alongside abbi. The third one is humphrey i think
Well it fits the explanation. Watching over the dreamer on his room or something idk
HUMPHREY?!
Yup, Humphrey is the Oldest, in the Omori route >!you find a book while sorting through Sunny's belongings detailing about 'Hungry Humphrey' or something like that. Meaning Humphrey is the oldest by being based off a book Sunny was read when he was extremely young. Some time in Sunny's 4 year isolation Humphrey lost his mind I think and was sent to Deeper Well.!<
humphrey is one of the characters that know \*the thruth\* him having so many personalities and versions of him inside his mouth is because he knew the truth for many years and couldnt take it or something like that
As he got the idea for Humphrey from a book called Hungry Hungry Humphrey id assume they are humanized versions of the animals the whale ate in the book.
thats a good theory
Thank you 👍
How much did Humphrey love air conditioning?
Enough for the only big boi swear in the game.
Why does Humphrey fucking love air conditioning?
Super cringe + overused meme + no you’re not + I’m at the Humphrey lab and I still hate RL aubery + imagine liking a punk ass dick + FUCK AUBERY

now nickname humphrey. My nickname would be . . # H
I don't remember seeing concept art for the raft in >! Humphreys insides !<.. . If there is, show it to me, it is my favorite ship.
I prefer the black space one.
How did you even find this comment?
Omori subreddit deep diving.. . I may be obsessed.
Understandable have a good day.
Humphrey
humphrey
H20:HCL or Humphrey theme idk it sounds very calming and yet distant as if your in a dream
humphrey is a terrible segment and a terrible boss.. . that isn’t a misconception, i just hate him
I can respect that. . . Not hating the game section, hating Humphrey 
Wrong, it was >!Humphrey when describing air conditioners!<
Ooohh, nice one
Nope. That would be Humphrey the Whale.
Oh, well that's actually interesting lol
I'm not really in the community anymore so i guess comments in a post like that are helping me refresh my memory lol. . Humphrey?
Yes
Humphrey
Yes! :D
The inside of Humphrey??
yeah
Humphrey 🗿
Ohh is it Humphrey ??
no. do you want the answer?
Yeah
snaley
was thinking of humphrey :0
Oop gg
no its humphrey
Oh 🗿 gg
Humphrey
Correct!🎉
Humphrey
Humphrey?
Wobbly
🗿 gg
Its mutant heart kinda evil i guess close
Humphrey
Humphrey?
VERY VERY VERY CLOSE
Burpmo?
It was molly
I don't think so. It would have his portrait sprite if he did. When you talk to Omori before breaking the light bulb and in Humphreys lab thing, he has a sprite portrait. Even though he just says '... '
He is fighting Humphrey.
I ate the guy who ate the guy who ate the guy who ate the guy who ate him. Edit: whale done you found Humphrey 
a PC Setup, a PS2, air conditioning (and not because of Humphrey), a shotgun (so I can legally kill people who break into my mind), and a Nuclear Warhead in a secret compartment somewhere
I am going to turn Humphrey into lamp oil
 idk I like her whole design and personality from what we’ve seen from her in the Omori route (+ from Humphrey himself) >!also she’s lazy af which kinda reminds me of myself !<
Me but when i forgot to save after the >!slime girls and humphrey and about an hour exploring The Orange Oasis!<
Not much scares me but I was very unnerved in the Humphrey boss
The scariest part is someone that seemed friendly suddenly turning hostile and vicious. I thought Humphrey was such a cool, funny character, and then he gives us the hungry eyes and his smile suddenly looks a lot different. Very unsettling.
when you go down the hole in Humphrey on the T key
The Humphrey fight, doing that at midnight in the dark was horrible
When the experiment got loose in Humphrey. Timed shit has always scared me 
The part where I didn’t have any food items or toys before fighting Humphrey
Of course my friend *insert humphrey dance*
>! Just got through Humphrey. I got side track working for a leaf and going back to the unbread twins. I will say so many themes got real and saddened me a bit !<
Ooh, for me Humphrey was the worst part to get through, and now you're in the absolute best part of the game and one of my favorite media pieces of all time, you should leave the subreddit until you finish to avoid spoilers.
I think the kite flyer was the worst part. But if you’re claiming it’s amazing I’ll take your advice! Honestly know it should be good judging  on how much fun I’m already having
Have fun when you still can, because there is a big load of depression incoming and it's very close.
........your
I beat the game. I’m not ashamed of admitting I cried
Welcome to the club my friend. No denying, I cried like a little child from >!Omori fight to end. And will probably cry again if I play it again.!< I felt a huge emptiness and sadness for at least 2 weeks so if you feel the same I suggest you looking at the memes both on here and YouTube and also playing Hikikomori route. It has lots of things that you don't see in a normal route. And out of curiosity, what ending did you do?
I got the good ending. It felt rude not opening the door
I cried. I haven’t cried in a while, but I did. I got a good ending
The good ending, there's only one, the rest are terrible. Glad you enjoyed the game!
Real world is always a spoiler, and anything in Headspace past Humphrey is considered a spoiler.
>!the mystery potion you get from one of the slime sisters in humphrey!<
>!More explanation: the mystery potion, when used, changes sunny's sprite to a female one. It looks like the concept art above. Sadly, it only works in the underwater locations of the game: the Last Resort, Deep Well, Deeper Well, the Abyss and Humphrey.!<
From my understanding, it can also be used in other rare instances, such as >!black-space!<.
i already get it, but how do u use it?
From the inventory?
It’s in your toys for some reason

Humphrey, of course
The closest there was to a 4th wall break was that one Humphrey in the room with the bomb code on his back
It's "bmob," smh. . Humphrey haters these days 😔
Ah, I forgot about that dialogue.
That one was like the funniest part in the game for me. "Imagine what would have happened if I accidentally wrote another O?"
\*another B(cause boob)
Man for some reason I thought the code was bomb and not boom
Humphrey. Bottom text.
***I Fucking LOVE Air Conditioning!***. . - That One Humphrey.
All I'm gonna say is, look at the Slime Girls, and look at Humphrey.
Make everyone depressed af and make the enemy happy. Helped me beat Humphrey. Enemy whiff+ increased tank is op
for my first playthrough i was a psycho who didnt use emotions unless a boss put them on me, up until humphrey when i said "nah i need to make this easier" and then i realised i didnt use emotions at all... (i should read tutorials more often)
It takes so long to get out of Humphrey I just wished we didn't have to go thru their unless we want too and yeah kinda like in real life no matter what you do the truth or what you did will still hunt you no matter what
I guess the game has sections like like that which could be considered "filler". I don't mind it since my hair comb sized brain can't think of any other replacement that won't make it so that the story doesn't feel more diluted than it previously was or rushed.
Nah it's fine but if you want the story humpry is such a grind to get thru
Im gonna guess humphrey
Why’d you give us nothing to go on 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙄🙄🙄 idk but maybe Humphrey???
Its Humphrey clearly
I do like Humphrey lol
humphrey
I love the art style too it’s so cute and makes a nice contrast with the horror parts. . currently right now I’m at Humphrey kinda stuck on it and I don’t think my dad can help like with the spider puzzle
Honestly you won't really lose anything storywise by looking up the answers. Make sure to be wary of spoilers though, sites will generally tell you.
Humphrey
When you go down Humphrey second time - to the room with PerfectHeart (previously SlimeGirls' boss fight room, the main humphrey elevator or whatever its name), the three witches' rooms around are unlocked. The witches' heads are there and if you talk to them, they request to collect some stuff to restore their bodies (scrap metal, rat meat and snot). After you collect and give them theses things (1 enemy from each location is enough), each of the witches give you something in return. Medusa (the right room) gives you Mystery potion (can only be used underwater, the effect "wears off" before the mirror and when you try to travel with Pluto (maybe some other scenes as well like the well ladder in the video), etc).
Humphrey is Sunny bottling down his guilt by eating the party, probably. Someone pointed out that the entire party has been through the journey before, so it wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the adventure probably ended numerous times at Humphrey, right before collecting the last keys to access Black Space.
It make senses, and  it is note-worthy that Humphrey is described as the “Oldest” in headspace
I thought the currency was clams because >!Humphrey eats them!< and they were able to make the story flow better using that
although, >!Humphrey will eat a paper check that is worth a lot of clams!< in the alternate route.
Wait... Humphrey Malfoy?, That weird tree in the Deeper Well as Dumbledore?!?
everyone's talking about the L key but are we not gonna talk about how they killed humphrey on three days left??
Humphrey better
based and humphrey-pilled
Who is humphrey?
The brother of dumphery.
Who is dumphery
The brother of Humphrey, duh! . . Just kidding, Dumphery is seven feet tall and really intimidating. But he likes to buy the small cakes that Omori bakes.
Humphrey face on the hydrodere fits so well holy shit.
The whole Humphrey segment has done of the best tracks in the game TBF.
All the Humphrey and >!blackspace!< Section stuff and also stardust diving and lost library.
Humphrey 😭
Fucking Humphrey lives while poor mutantheart doesn't
hey! humphrey risked his life to keep all the backup hearts from dying! he’s a hero! (ignore userflair this comment was completely unbiased) this message was sponsored by HUMPHREYCO.com
You are not gonna tell me they prefer humphrey over mutantheart
It's favourites or their too strong for Omori and the gang
Actually, I’m fairly certain the actual reason is that all of the bosses that survive are integral to the cycle of Headspace (Sweetheart, Humphrey, Boss, Pluto, Spaceboy, Jawsum, Humphrey, and Slime Girls) OR wouldn’t make sense if they were truly killed (Earth and Perfectheart). The one strange exception to this pattern is the Unbread Twins, but then again, they’re also the only character who isn’t integral to the cycle of Headspace to have skeletons of the playable characters in their lair, so Sunny / Omori might simply just enjoy the challenge they provide, or Omori elects to have Sunny go there if he’s afraid that he’s gotten too powerful on this cycle and needs to reset Headspace prior to Humphrey, since maybe Humphrey wouldn’t have been enough in those situations. However this is also contradicted by the fact that the Unbread Twins can’t actually kill you, so the Unbread Twins might just be a genuine case of favoritism.
The unbread twins are too good to be killed
Unbread twins keep them from truly dying by turning them into revivable toast
I think it’s fair to assume in that route they still survived and such. It’s just OMORI never goes back to check. Humphrey stays submerged and only would resurface after the good ending occurs.
When you go inside of Humphrey again in the >!Hikikomori Route!< She's perfectly fine
You know humphrey eates Slime girls right?
>!They survive in the Hikikomori Route actually.!<
How? I saw them die
In the hikkikomori route you can actually go back to Humphrey by getting a huge cheque from Mr.Jawsum and feeding it to Humphrey. There inside Humphrey you can find the slime girls if you visit their respective labs.
Oh cool
im gonna kms i accidentally >!killed snaley when i saw him in humphrey yesterday SNALEYS MY FAV CHARACTER OMFG!<
Doesn’t Humphrey eat the slime sisters? I guess technically the Omori party didn’t kill them but they do die I think
Franchement je sais pas comment tu peux t'en sortir, la touche D est dans la décharge et la T dans Humphrey si je me souviens bien, mais je pense qu'avoir installé le mod en milieu de game était pas une giga bonne idée. J'ai vu dans un commentaire que t'as essayé de supprimer le mod et que ça marche pas, t'as essayé de lancer le jeu sans le mod loader ?
"Lancer le jeu sans le mod loader". . . J'ai pas compris
Bah pour avoir ton mod français, t'as utilisé un logiciel à part pour que les mods fonctionnent sur le jeu, non ?
Ah oui, il y a un programme fourni pour enlever le patch, c'est ce que j'ai fait mais ça ne fonctionnait pas
T'as essayé de désinstaller le jeu en entier et réinstaller ? Si tu l'as sur Steam normalement t'as les sauvegardes sur le cloud, après si t'es pas sûr que ça les gardes bien, essaye de les trouver dans les fichiers et met les autre part sur ton pc, puis tu les remettra après avoir réinstallé
force a toi tu t’es vrment softlock a cause d’un prn de patch j’aurais pleure
update. There are four more skills that can go past the damage cap. I’ll put them here tomorrow!
Absolute legend, I've been looking for something like this.. . Thank you for clarifying the redundancy of emotion advantages.. . I always thought Manic vs Furious would do more damage than Happy vs Furious, I checked everywhere online if I was tripping or not since I couldn't notice any differences in combat.. . Thanks again.
basically, manic party vs angry enemy doesn’t do more damage than happy party vs angry enemy; the manic party will TAKE less damage. However, happy vs furious will do more damage than happy vs angry.. . You’re welcome!
I have one more question;. . Sad vs Neutral will give a defense favour for the former.. . so a defense bonus of 25% for the first tier. . . We know Angry has an emotion advantage over Sad, so it will cause bonus damage. . . My question is; Will its bonus damage not be as strong as say, Happy vs Angry? Because as a passive effect vs. neutral, Sad will give greater defense. Does that resistance apply slightly when an emotion advantage is considered? . . So if sad theoretically takes 150% bonus damage from an angry opponent, will some of that defense that is registered to our character sheet kick in? And make us take slightly less damage at around 125%. . I hope I made sense, thanks.
I think I know what you’re asking; you’re asking if angry v sad will do less damage than happy v angry.. . The answer is yes. Until the party gets to the furious stage, angry v sad is a very bad emotion advantage due to sad’s raised defense and its juice shield (some damage gets converted to juice).. . What we did here was drain the enemy’s juice, so that they don’t have the juice shield. . . I can give a more detailed explanation if you need, but hopefully your question has been answered!
You've answered it. Thanks
You're a madman for calculating this lol. It's cool to see someone go so deep into the combat since it's usually overlooked.
I appreciate some1 sharing their craziness so i dont feel crazy alone. . Crazy?
I was crazy once. They locked me in a room. A white room. A white room filled with stairs. And stairs makes me crazy.
I missed a few skills though. It gets wilder; juice me has the possibility to do 15k damage LOL. . Update tomorrow!
jesus christ
Home Run or Death Jam
it's neither, actually!
Is Run ‘n Gun’s damage really “only” Speed x 1.5? I thought I heard somewhere that it was something like Speed x 5 or something way higher.
Nice will wood reference at the end
Actually, you can can activate the second part of the doll secret on the true route as well, you just have to beat Humphrey
And after defeating HUMPHREY, you can go back and interact with it, and look into its eyes for a fun surprise!
Hi! I probably should be more clear on instructions so I'll edit it now.. . Also, some entrances open up after defeating Humphrey or after a dream world reset. I'll write that down too!
I’ve pretty much done everything you can do in my hikikomori run and still couldn’t get the beach one, but I got pretty much all of the other ones!! It’s a great list I’m glad you put it up because I would’ve missed a lot of cool stuff :) thank you!!! I still couldn’t get the beach one to work for some reason but I very well could have done it already or something and don’t remember haha
i ended up levelling up tons and focusing on my juice more as they switch both juice and hp further on into the fight, defeated them pretty quickly and also the same with humphrey which was surprising as many people say he takes long and is really difficult but i didnt run into that issue
Level 26 is pretty low. I was level 35 when I started Last Resort.. . Edit: Okay Level 35 was over-leveled. That said, Level 26 is still pretty low for the end of the Humphrey arc.
35 is an unbelievable over-level
Yes, I said so in my edit.. . Level 26 is still low for the Slime Girls fight.
Not really. I’d say 26 is pretty good
I disagree. They still gave me trouble at whatever level I was when I tackled them.
I fought them at level 25 and it was really easy
Was close to max level when i fought humphrey first time: second time i was underleveled af still kicked his ass with the power of anger and speed ngl games kinda easy is there a hard mode i can activate?
I don’t think level 26 is low at all, the first time I played the game, I beat slime girls at around level 17-19 in only a few tries. It was tough but I think anything above 30 just makes the boss unrewarding
i beat them at like level 19 or so pretty easily
i beat them at level 22 dude am i js massively underlevelled or 
It’s funny, i got to level 21 when i finished that segment, and in my last playthrough, i was reaching one level lower
i bet them at lvl 18 but now i cant beat humphrey, the fight against slime girls wasnt too hard
firstly, (though it doesnt seem to be an issue because you made it to the humphrey fight, im just saying this in general) make sure *all* of them are level 40 or above (that can happen if youre grinding for one of them thats "underleveled" from the rest of them), then i would fight. usually what i did was use skills half the time, while also using hero's cook for the teammates that are on low amount of health (more or so enough towards where humphrey can one shot them or they're down half their health). . if that still doesnt work, id advice using the kel nuke (make kel happy, give him coffee, make him flex then do rebound (i believe its rebound)) during humphrey. . whatever you do, try your best to keep all of them alive during the last stage of humphrey (humphrey swallows the party, causing them to lose health and go deeper inside humphrey). . im sorry if my advice is shit im on a time limit and i typed as fast as i could 
I totally didn’t use this silly farm to get everyone up to level 50 before entering Humphrey. I also definitely didn’t use it to pay for Rococo’s paintings, and then had 100,000 clams I exchanged for clems. . . 10/10 best farm. Quality seacow milk.
I used dino dig to grind exp..... Which do you think is a better farming spot?. . ALSO I FORGOT ABOUT THE PAINTINGS THANK YOU
I liked the squizzards because I don’t have to pay to get there. I get paid to do it. There’s also a nice healing spot inside the barn so I found it easier to just use the farm. It’s also the same enemy over and over again and you can just use the same strategy to win every time.. . I mean, I only used Dino dig to get items and found running into enemies annoying so…
Damn you're right
Ik this was 2 years ago but three strat I used in Dino's dig was using a key and then go up and back to fight the bunny by the door
It's the location before Humphrey. Have you played omori?
Sorry, I haven't :( And currently I haven't dared to spend money on games in general yet, though Omori is definitely cheap.
Understandable. Cheap? Omori cost a lot for me to get but thats probably cause I got the collectors edition plus my country is expensive 😢
It's roughly 7 dollars where I live, which is honestly not that big of an investment for me.
Understandable. The regular physical edition is about probably $68 in my country which is like $34 usd
Oof, holy hell! And Omori is a $20 indie game in the US...
You haven't? Your knowledge is seriously impressive for the one who didn't play the game. Frankly, even if you did play, it still would be.
~~#humphrey of the unofficial Omori Discord server ate them.~~. . ~~We'll get him next time.~~
Nah he said it once in humphrey
that's omori when talked to inside humphrey
Remember when Omori and friends got vore'd by humphrey? lol XD rox0rz
I remember that!! rolf xd

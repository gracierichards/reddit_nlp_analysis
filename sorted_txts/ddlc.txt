Don't worry, I've backed up each character !
Late but its from DDLC
Doki doki piano club
No violins allowed
Knifes allowed
Yuri x Omori
oh my god their themes fit into each other so well too. Monika is the only 'real' person just like omori in his dream world DDD':
They want another person and will do anything to get them
That's funny because piano... . . ...ok now I'm crying
PIANO!. . **CRASH**. . WHO’S IDEA WAS THIS!
Asdf movie is something we don't deserve.
OMORI LOOKS SO FUNNY (≧▽≦)
2 psychological game merge, nice
for double depresso
this is perfect hahaha
LESS GOOO!! cool art!! it looks so much like official art it took me a few to realize lol
This just made my day ^.^ thank you!
the more i look in these comments, the more these games share in common-. . also i now wanna see art of these two character groups interacting-
I love this lol. As soon as I found out omori existed it immediately reminded me of a crossover between DDLC and Undertale
Yes!
Everyday, I imagine the future when You can die alone 🎶
I might want, to close my eyes, so i can dream more 🎶
My favorite games all in one. . \*downloads image\*
oh jesus
Every day-  **falls from the too of the hospital!!
the two simultaneously worst and best psychological horror games
Twice the cast, and quadruple the ptsd
The best thing about this is how >!omori LITERALLY HAS THE ERASE ABILITY IN THE FINAL FIGHT!<
I DONT LIKE WHERE THIS IS GOING
YOOO THATS SO GOOD
IT FITS??
So Dream Natsuki love Dream Monika, and real Monika loves real Natsuki. And real Natsuki is a delinquent.
doki doki music club
Raion the amount of unexplainable joy your art gives me 👌
this is actually really good
Thank you raion  . Youve always been one of my favorite ddlc artists  . and you crossed it with one of my othyer favorite games  . thank you
*I needed this.*
All of my ptsd in one image, thanks mate
I fucking love it
wheres the fucked up part
Wait. . But what is Monika's counterpart in the real world?
If only there was a few more characters in DDLC.
Ah!! I love this!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I LOVE THIS
I played both of these games for the first time one after the other. Life protip: do not do that
OMONI
They're basically the same game. Or, they have similar styles and vaguely similar characters at the least.. . Same font, different words.
They are in order of largest to smallest in height, and  biggest to smallest in breasts
Wait does this count as sexual?
Same character arc
this fits too well
An interaction between Omori and Monika would be **quite** interesting.
As a DDLC and Omori fan, DDLC and Omori fans are in the same boat.
Mmm, Ceiling yoga.
doki doki fan here, can confirm.
Yes
Indeed
My thoughts on each:. . Jojo: Haven't watched it yet but Giorno's theme is a banger. . DDLC: Never played it so I don't get the joke. . Pokemon: Cynthia's theme gives me hype and not PTSD tbh (Am I one of the only people that didn't get PTSD from her battle as a kid?). . Dark Souls: Same as DDLC. . OMORI: Yes, I did cry the first time I listened to Final Duet. (More out of happiness for Sunny but thats besides the point)
All of these, cept I need to actually play doki doki, dark souls, and and omori but I spent all my money on tf2 omegalul
The DDLC community has kept itself alive through sheer fucking willpower
The Mother fandom though
As a man that's in the doki doki Fandom and the omori Fandom I love this
It's funny because I recently just picked up both DDLC and Omori at around the same time and now I'm seeing plenty of crossover memes between the two games
yes finally doki doki and omori crossover!!
no ddlc is a sin
Nah DDLC is in the Indie Horrror room
wouldnt omori be there too?
Stay safe y’all ✌️ Every day I get more tempted to buy DDLC and play it for myself, but alas, I must keep my sanity
r/UnexpectedDDLC
osu, omori and ddlc. Uuuh
doki doki honto[?] ni ne ti[?]
Demi livado kono wado de king
I wouldn't say dead. It's just past its prime. When there's no new content being released, there really isn't much to talk about or discuss that hasn't been said already when it was a hot topic.. . Just like DDLC, the fandom is still there, but it's mostly fanart. Nothing wrong with that, it's just the natural cycle of games and fandoms, especially with much smaller fanbases.
Thought this was a teaser for a new DDLC game for a sec lmfao
Doki doki but omori
>!You just spoiled the game for anyone who has already played Doki Doki Literature Club and seen the copious "leave her hanging" jokes they make in THAT fandom...!<
Have you seen what happens in the game besides that? It turns into an entirely different game at one point
>!yeah, the suicidal/mental health stuff is only partly taken seriously for the first part of the game, it's kind of a red herring. that character does talk about having depression beforehand, and tries to reach out to a friend for help, but it turns out later that it was actually caused by... meta bullshit. which is what DDLC is ACTUALLY about.!<
um... i wasn't really trying to recommend it to you.. . >!there's a LITTLE bit of buildup, like a scene or two where the character describes living with depression, and it's very in-character and realistic, and it's honestly kind of poignant, because it shows that people can be depressed even if they don't show it!... but then that all gets completely forgotten about while the game does its Freaky Glitchy Meta Bullshit and gradually goes off the rails.!<. . it's still a good story, and it's not a BAD portrayal of mental health, i think a lot of games could learn from it- but it's still not exactly a GREAT portrayal of mental health either. it's not the main focus of the story. the mental health discussion is *mainly* just there to >!foreshadow the Big Shocking Moment.!<
Wow they will recreate on oneshot on console like what they did with ddlc+
doki doki literature club
Natsuki from Doki Doki Literature Club is a pretty similar character to Aubrey from OMORI.. . Related.
DDLC
Monika from the visual novel Doki Doki Literature Club
Monkia (DDLC)
monika from doki doki literature club.
monika from ddlc ofc
i don’t like that your avatar looks like monika from ddlc it makes this even worse
What’s wrong with nonika
nothing, I like monika.
Me too, as long as it is done right, I don't want a job done like DDLC+, that starts good but then you discover that it is full of errors.
True for me, but the other way around. . . I joined the DDLC sub before OMORI.
I just couldn't look at that place for long without feeling great amounts of second hand embarrassment 
Yeah, me too. I like the game but the subreddit is just weird
Basically what happened to me. *OMORI* got me interested in psychological horror, and I was like "hey... DDLC is a psych-horror game, let's check it out!". . Pretty cool game, though it's only minimally similar to *OMORI*.
Never played it. I see that DDLC is free on Steam but there’s also a Plus version for $15. Any major differences that you know of?
DDLC+ is basically side stories AFAIK. . Also, DDLC is a fantastic game, play it blind ASAP
I hate how the DDLC community just focuses on the girly part and forgets the whole game is dark as shit 
I hate how the OMORI community just focuses on literally anything but the actual game and forgets the whole game is dark as shit 
Omori fans forget about literally everything but the ending
*me who plays DDLC and Omori*. . They ain't wrong.
My friend got into Doki Doki after I made a reference for it without ever actually playing it now he finished the game and gave me some money to buy it. . Not sure if it was a good or a bad decision
Doki Doki Literature Club is free though (unless you mean the plus version)
Yeah the main reason he even played was because it was free but he gave me money to buy the plus version
Okay, but how does DDLC even work on the Switch?. >! Doesn't the end of the game require you to enter the game's files and delete Monica? !<
Is the best friend of Monika from DDLC
🇧🇷?
Wrong!. . Here's a tip, aside from breaking the 4th wall, what Monika does in her free time?
Monika from DDLC
no
the answer:. . >!attack.omo!<
Not as scary as the secret black and white ending in DDLC... just saying....
AYE THAT SHIT WAS MORTIFYING
ACTUALLY THOUGH
Can you guys send a link or something, i can't find it anywhere.

Lmao i thought you guys mean an omori ending, now i realised it was that doki doki literature club thing.
AND THE AUDIO?? EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SCREEN IS A NONO
YEAH
hehe googly eyes
ive seen enough
Wait what happens in it
you mean.. black and white menu background
I'm starting to imagine how a omori ddlc mod would go... It would be interesting, maybe not good, but interesting nonetheless
Hmmm sounds interesting.
Oh god we’ve been traumatised enough
`y r u like this`
IMO, a bit too plain but eh, i won't do any better honestly, maybe her personality and past just weren't uncovered too well or i'm just stupid and skipped half the things like it happened with ddlc, really. don't kill me please.... but like seriously name me her distinct character traits other than kind and forgiving. (edit: and scary ass hell version)
Yeah I mean there’s DDLC
You can make them with the DDLC scene creator. I used to play around with it all the time lol. I wish I still had the browser link.

THANK YOU 😩😩😩😩😩😩
You're welcome‼️‼️
☺️💙
Somehow, I felt like it. Saw it on the steam store page + very positive reviews (I don't remember if it was overwhelimgly) + Psychological horror tag, try a new game that I never thought I'll like (same with ddlc but that was free and like a week after launch). . Life is unexpected and this will be my intro to rpg maker games. If I wasted my money on an rpg maker then it is still cheaper than missing out on experiencing this type of game at least once. So I bought it blindly without even reading the description. . Really, really glad I did that. Actually taught me something irl. Guess I'll trust my intuition for a future game
If I remember correctly, I found it after looking for a game similar to DDLC. I'm glad I found it, I love Omori so much.
i think the person who made this doesn't understand the game, half of the things they said are also things that happen in games like ddlc but they didn't say nothing about it

Okay you win
Amazing (ngl forgot that its a OMORI sub for a moment lol)
me too. i hope we’re not disturbing them
Don't be, that was impressive.
Idk man I think its ddlc 🤔
You’re Absolutely right! 🙏🙏‼️‼️
Just morningka :3
Jinx r/arcane
(as supported and seen in the last picture)
(& 9th. if you look in a corner, there's a monika card. :>)
exactly
Then you see the just Monica bit in the last picture, it's ddlc?
Doki Doki Literature Club. . 
ITS DDLC!!!
That's neat! I'm hoping one day he can play OMORI and record his reactions, like how he did when playing Doki Doki Literature Club years ago.
My dumb-ass brain thought this was Yuri cosplay from DDLC. also, rip your inbox
SAME
Lmao
Same
Whenever I see rip inbox comments, I always wonder how true it is. OP is your inbox getting pummeled?
Yeah lol
Me too because I’m in both subs lol.
You look a little like Yuri from DDLC with that wig. It looks nice.
Love this!! It also reminds me a lot like Yuri from ddlc
looks like monika from ddlc
ee ddlc and omoriii
And before I think I'm a cringey weeaboo I saw Jack play doki doki so I gave it a run through it was cool cuz I love horror games lol
I got that same unsatisfactory feeling with the “thank you for enjoying ” note, DDLC did the same thing, and its so petty and selfish of me to expect more, just the mediocre thank you note is starting to feel insincere.. . For me personally with DDLC, the insincerity of the “thank you for playing ” note hit harder, due to me spending 3-4 whole hours trying to get the ending, so it’s fair to say I haven’t really had a good relationship with these notes to begin with.. . . I get its been a few months but id just like to apologize for this, I really should’ve thought about the game and the creator, not about myself, apologies
Do you mind sharing what you wanted more than a thank you?
ignoring how entitled you sound, you say you spent only 3-4 hours on ddlc? what about the 20+ hours or at the VERY LEAST 12 hours you spent on omori? the only thing that's "insincere" about a "mediocre thank-you note" is your ungrateful response. it's christmas. lighten up.
...you're coming off as a bit entitled there, friend. What were you expecting exactly?
I don’t really understand why people are coming at you so hard. Anyhow, I feel like the main reason the “thank you for playing/enjoying/experiencing ” notes are so prevalent at the end of games like Omori, OneShot, DDLC, etc. are because most of the time the indie devs that make them have a small amount of traction in the video game scene, if any, when releasing their game. I feel like the “thanks for playing” is actually quite genuine because of the fear these devs must have that the game could flop on release and leave all the time they spent working on it for naught. They genuinely appreciate each player because without them, their game wouldn’t go anywhere. I’m willing to bet the first Call of Duty game probably thanked you, the player, for playing it in the end credits as well, and now look at it.
ah yeah I guess I understand that, it was still pretty incompetent of me to say that, I really didn't think too hard about the indie devs behind the games despite being such a big fan of them myself
You don't get any presents
Wow fuck you too!
3-4 whole hours VS 7 seven years making a game for our dear @omoriwanderer come here and be a bitch about it
When I see ddlc, omori, and katawa shoujo in one post, i have no choice but to upvote
:)
i'm just guessing that one of them is from DDLC, but i haven't played so I don't know which. . the other is even a bigger mystery
The one on the left is Sayori from DDLC, one on the right is Misha from Katawa Shoujo
ah, that’s why it looked familiar! haven't played this game but i remember the discussions around it when it came out!
The outfit is sadly a bit generic, for characters in more normal clothing you kind of have to go with a group for the whole cast. My sister made a similar mistake, she dressed as Monika from DDLC for a convention and didn't get recognized either.
bruh how tf did DDLC get such a high rating
I mean its a good game
Reminds me of the happy thoughts thing from ddlc

LOL! will be noting on to that where i wont be seeing any spoilers. when it comes to sadness, I have came here for that. I have played DDLC before, and unfortunately i wasn't that depressed, I was just sad that i had to loose my favourite character to complete that game. Well i hope those voids can be filled in Omori....
Only look up for help if you really don't know what to do on one of the puzzles, don't ask reddit, go to a website
as a ddlc and omori fan i need this so badly
>!...i know that what you said isn't directly a spoiler, but anyone who has interacted with the DDLC fanbase is going to realize there's a double meaning there pretty quickly.!<
Yeah im bluring it. I domt think its a huge spoiler but i def think its enough. Thanks for the heads up
Yeah, I remember seeing him make like 100 life-size cutouts of Monika from DDLC
Fr, when I saw their announcement on Twitter, I was planning on only getting Basil and getting the rest later. Then I remembered that I had to pay scalpers on eBay to get all the DDLC plushies, and i have no idea when or if they’re going to make more OMORI plushies so I just adopted them all. . And I am so glad I did, they’re so cute I can’t wait for them to come in and to show them off and just have an army of OMORI, DDLC, and Celeste plushies by my side at all times 💛
Yeah that was my impression too. I knew I wanted all of them and was having a rough time pulling the trigger. My delay cost me an extra set of shipping to get the rest but that pales in comparison to what I would have had to pay if I was getting it second hand later.
These sold out faster then the Ddlc plushies
reminds me of the DDLC subreddit where someone would ask whether or not monika is the great satan every week or two
OH I HATED HER TOO OH NO-. . I never understood why people liked her, but to be fair my bias was yuri and i was very passionate about that hah.

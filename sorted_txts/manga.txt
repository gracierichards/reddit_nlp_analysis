I'm not sure if you knew this already but the manga got an anime adaptation!
What's the manga?
Idk either lol, it's just a random screenshot that I saved on my phone.
We may not get any *official* content, but the more talented of us may wonder what an animated version of this would look like, then make that animation. Or they may wonder what a comic/manga version would like, then make it.. . Us fans can do some amazing things. 🙂
Yeah fandoms like LISA are on their deathbed but the fangames and modders are somehow keeping it alive
Had to read it a second time because i didn't realize it's like a manga
Didn't they literally kiss in the manga? And isn't the Whole Thing that Kaworu gave Shinji unconditional love as a way to manipulate him? And don't they share a bed? Also did you actually read the source that I gave there? Because it thoroughly explains the JAPANESE tendency of pairing black and white haired boys up. . Also Shinji literally has daddy issues of course he's gay/s
>I doubt it it considering both the director, the voice actor, and the entire studio have rejected the idea at every turn. . Actually looked into it because you so gracefully left no sources- Shinji's VA apparently denied the show, but Asuka and Rei's have gone on record comparing the two to Ichigo and Orihime as seen [here,]()  and Anno Fucking Hideki has gone on interview with JUNE, a Yaoi magazine, discussing NGE's end and describing Kaworu's actions as seductive and homoerotic, as seen [here.]() . . >If the pairing is in your head then the source isn't really relevant.. . I mean, one can influence others (which was my original point btw) without the clear intention of doing so, there have definitely been gay stories inspired by the likes of Naruto and Sasuke despite Kishimoto's very clear aversion to the ship. Even if it's not necessarily romantic, the concept of visual contrast on hair in very close same-gender friends might have been popularized in anime by NGE, as Kaworu and Shin are undoubtedly intimate and the work's success may have lead other mangaka and anime artists to create similar dynamics. . I have more points that I want to make but I'm tired as fuck rn and they'll come out even more disorganized than the mess above, hope you can actually understand it
Ok, I'll start by saying something I think I should've said a long time ago: Word of God is not the trump card you think it is. Cast members often have opinions that differ from the canon and from eachother, *especially* when it comes to shipping and even more when said ship is a gay one from the 90s. It's called "Death of the Author", and it's a really important concept in literary analysis, as it allows new meanings to come from media without them being necessarily the author's intent.. . That being said, let's run through some of these points of yours. . >So, the director, the mangaka, and the voice actor for the character say no, but two other random voice actors say yes.. . As you said, the Manga is not a primary source, so its writer shouldn't be considered, the VA for the character has no say in the story at all, so their opinion holds as much weight as every other VA, and as to the director? We'll get to him.. . >The interview you linked he literally says there's no carnal desires involved:. . Your quote was taken out of context. That is specifically talking about Shinji initially blushing when meeting Kaworu, which most likely meant he didn't feel sexual attraction at first.. . Now, here are some quotes with context:. . >Interviewer: Well then, conversely, when you seduce someone, or when you are seduced, do you think that you’d like to be told something like that? Telling someone or being told by someone, “Your heart is like glass,”—did anything like that actually happen to you?. . >Anno: Nope, nothing like that.. . Here we have Anno not disagreeing with the claim that Kaworu was seducing Shinji. . >Interviewer: You said previously that that sort of JUNE-like, or should I say the sort of production that goes beyond friendship, came out that way naturally, didn’t you?. . June is a yaoi magazine, so here we have the director saying the relationship was yaoi-like.. . >Anno: A person named Satsukawa (Akio)-san did [the original script]. Satsukawa-san is better at—this is bad to say, but—he’s right on the mark when it comes to homoeroticism. *laughs*. . LITERALLY SAYING THERE WAS HOMOEROTICISM. He later says he toned it down a bit because the scenes were too homoerotic, but the fact that someone was tasked with writing the script in such a way means it was part of the plan.. . >Let me ask you this, why do you think on the re-release of the series on netflix, the studio took the translation into its own hands and changed the subbing?. . [Because the translator wanted it to be infered by the audience instead of said to them]() (also the word originally used in Japanese can mean either like or love, the meaning is purposefully ambiguous and I'm pretty sure they could've picked a word that was purely meant as 'like' if they really wanted to).. . >And I looked it up, you said that they "literally kiss" in the manga, but the mangaka has gone out and said that they aren't in love either.. . "Sure, they kiss and make out and get married and have three children but the definitely not homophobic producers said it was nothing!" That's what you sound like. . . I just read that scene, and while the "kiss" isn't exactly a kiss per se (Kaworu "did CPR" on a hyperventilating Shinji), the outcome of it is Shinji being a blushing mess while Kaworu asks several invasive questions about kissing and love. Shinji says he hates him and two boys shouldn't fall in love,  though, so it'd make sense for the mangaka to say there was nothing there, and as was previously established, the Manga ultimately does not matter, so I digress.. . After all that, what exactly am I getting at?. . Well, when some voice actors, the director, the translator, a screenwriter, [an editor]() and most importantly the canon itself seem favourable to the ship, it's not fucking "tumblr fujo fanfiction", it's a canon-implied pairing and should be treated as such. Have a good night, sir.
Omori is the game that I relate the most.. . I don’t go outside I’ve lost all my friends I have depression and I love anime manga (like you know the basic hikikomori) many people are hiki so yeah…. . Also I have trauma and they are ruining my life.
Its funny how the manga is currently ongoing but its so hard for anyone to read it outside of japan
Wait there’s a manga,??
Manga
My man
Link to manga shortcut
I’d like to do a video going over every difference between the manga and the game if it hasn’t been done yet. At least starting with the first chapter as its own video. Cause there’s already an essays worth of changes in it.
The game stuck to me as it has elements i do really relate to. A friend and my brother who do know of the game actually even pointed out some things and it helped me to get a better gasp of my own issues. . . Im just waiting in silence for the next physical manga drop here in Europe.. . And I trying to get that said friend to play omori. They just got a laptop  this month.
Manga
I've certainly noticed a steady decline of engagement in the fanfic-sphere. It doesn't help that I already write for a more niche part of the fandom (Headspace focus, none of the gang). As others have said, that's the curse oneshot games and other media face. A complete story was told, and a sequel just doesn't make sense.. . . The manga isn't helping as much as I'd hoped either. The direction it's being taken isn't particularly in-line with the game. 
I mean there is still the manga coming out so not really dead
Manga :)
I thought this was a meme about anime/Manga artist white washing all their characters. Lmfao
Might read. Thoughts on the manga?
its good but it’s really fucked up. i wouldn’t recommend it to everyone
I would recommend it to everyone.. . (I am evil and want everyone to become irreversibly depressed.)
Reading it now thanks
Oh trust me,you won't be thanking me by the end of it.
Good to know 😔
You should read The Children of Hurin by JRR Tolkien! It's a super epic prequel to Lord of the Rings! ;)
I don't recommend it if you're already on the edge mentally
Probably the most fucked up thing I've read (very very good and thought provoking)
It’s very well executed but very depressing. It does not inspire a lot of faith in humanity, but does tell very human stories of a variety of people.
That narrows it down so much mate . . It's about despair despair and despair only
I can think of stories that are very human and uplifting, and stories that are uplifting and feel fake. There are stories that are despairing that only focus on how horrible humanity is, and I don’t think Punpun is that exactly… instead it’s more focused on how humans are self-centered, sometimes cruel, sometimes kind. Not putting us in a box of evil, but just realistically depicting cruelty as well as kindness. . . The story is sad because the MC’s mental illness makes him feel so disconnected from other people that he feels like another species, and the moments where he actually feels human are inevitably followed by the cold “reality” that he isn’t “human” at all. He himself is self-centered, he does kind things for bad reasons, he does bad things for good reasons. It’s a real story, but what happens to him over time is simply sad. . . A story just about despair is a comedy. A story about hope and joy that’s constantly cut short is a tragedy. It’s not just despair on despair. There are moments of light, connection, and hope. That’s what makes it such a memorable series.
Yeah agreed . . Still this is the manga that people with depression and mental health issues should stay away from , . . I swear to god I would even recommend berserk coz yeah it's no joke on how depressing it can be also , but it's also motivating in brutal way
I think that series like this are most relatable for people who have mental health issues or depression. It can provide a great outlet and people who have dealt with those problems will probably understand the story better than those who have never experienced it. To be honest, in my opinion, a series like this would probably make someone in crisis feel seen or like they’re not alone before it made things worse, but maybe I’m naive or wrong about that… . . I absolutely love Berserk and love that you brought it up as a comparison, since it’s ultimately it’s about the struggle (ha) of dealing with depression and making a choice to live, center the people you love, fight the part of you that tells you to give up, and survive another day. Imo one of those most 1-1 allegories for suicidal depression in modern manga. . . Have you read Fire Punch? If you like Punpun and Berserk I think you would enjoy it. I read it and ended up reflecting on and writing about what it meant to me for quite a while.’
Vinland saga vagabond and berserk - Trinity if how to live as a man/woman manga
I dunno, I'm a practitioner of the truest way of reading manga.... . Surrounded by less than desirable ads of you know what.
or you could use mihon
>mihon. . wish they had desktop app, lol
A wholesome manga to read with ur family 😀😀😀😀😀
Me finishing berserk vol 13 be like : . . . Reading wholesome manga of a silly bird also didn't help it
I mean... If you look it a bit far, it's hard to see the dots. Also you may not know this, but mangas use pointillism or stippling when it comes to give color to a shirt, hair, skin, background, etc.
Your view here is understandable (there are sooo many dot techniques in art). For instance while stippling is used rarely in manga, what your probably thinking of is Screentone/halftone, which is a sticker-esk sheet layer on top of the original drawing and is cut into shape before prints are made. Which is different from American comics where they commonly use ben-day dots. Dots that are equally spaced to give the illusion of a color between the dots and the background color or used as shading. Like I said, there are a lot of dot techniques. [Here]() is another post that confuses stippling with pointillism, and [here’s]() a video about screentones/halftones. The world of dots is actually very interesting and I recommend you and your brother check it out more.
Oh you have Seraph of the End Mangas? That's cool
Yesss I only need volume 31 and catastrophe at 16 2 and 3 then I’m finished 
And then you can read the new Seraph of the end chapters online
I’m already reading them as they come out 
I would not be surprised if there was a light novel or manga somewhere in the world with that exact plot
maybe we're finally getting the english manga volumes physically?
Sorry, could you explain that? Wdym manga volumes??
Omori has a manga, being based off of the game. (Still ongoing tho)
Omg Where can I read it??
You can read it on K manga \^\^
ALR TYSMMMMMMMMMM IMMA GO CHECK IT OUT HEHRHEHEHE
Just an FYI, it’s paid after some point
Yeahh... Just saw, I'll try anyways. Thanks!
I've been reading it free  [Here]()
Thank you very much!
it's literally garbage unfortunately
Oh ok 😅
the omori manga
We have some news for you
Y'all just made me happy lmao
Kodansha actually announced recently that they got the license for the Omori manga in English but I could see them wanting to do a more formal announcement
Kodansha announced a few days ago that omori manga will be printed in English for spring 2026 so honestly this might be what this is about
Maybe merch or something Manga related
Console update for switch 2 maybe? It's probs just a merch or manga drop tho
Manga or animation related is my guess
THR HAIR LOOKS REALLY DETAILED IDKKKK IM THINKING OMORI ANIME 😭 we already got a manga so it's not too crazy to think
after that abomination that the manga is I have no hopes left honestly
Exactly my thoughts 😭
Probably dubbed manga physical
Fortnite collab (joke) But really im guessing this is probably some sort of news related to the manga or something
THR HAIR LOOKS REALLY DETAILED IDKKKK IM THINKING OMORI ANIME 😭 we already got a manga so it's not too crazy to think
Looks like something for the manga
Looks like something with the manga artstyle so I'm not getting my hopes up
Honestly to me it doesn’t rlly look like the manga art style… more like a realistic version their hair looks a lot more detailed…
Please god let this not be a manga thing please god let this not be a manga thing please god let this not be a manga thing
Isn’t that just promoting the manga or smth?
is the manga canon?
oh my golly gosh 
If the manga turns out to be good, having omori as an anime would not be a dream.
Non-Omori fans are finally gonna be right when they mistake Omori for an anime instead of a video game
but the different endings? how would they do that?
It's going to be published in I think this spring, so we're just going to have to wait and find out
ever heard of neon genesis evangelion? (jk idk)
What do you all think of the art style on the bottom? Looks a bit less innocent/child like vibe which fit more thematically imo
I think both the more innocent and less innocent art styles fit equally well in their own way.
this less innocent art style is definitely going to shine at the creepier parts of the story like pyrefly forest or humphrey.. . btw idk how the vibrant color of headspace is going to be implemented in the manga unless its colored which i doubt. 
I think even just a colored outline is enough for that just to give it a little bit of color. I hope the manga gives it justice though
Well everyone else could look significantly more happy
It looks very good.  Slightly different art style from the original, but just as good.
I like the artist's possible representation of the artstyle. . Maybe that specific style could be used in >!Blackspace!< and later parts
I may be wrong, but I think they will use two different styles for the real world and for non-real worlds (headspace and >!blackspace!<).. . The one we are used to will be used in the headspace, and the new style will be used in the real world.. . Why? Because the way we can differ those worlds in the game (before >!we see Kel for the first time!<) are the colors, and most mangas are black and white.
he looks yassified lol
I think it would be cool if the wholesome parts used the top style and then when it gets freaky use the bottom one
i honestly personally dont like the art style but maybe that will change as we see it more
slurp slurp crunch slurp crunch. slurp slurp
I don't like it :/
Jesus Christ. This could be either amazingly good. Or, be the worst thing ever. Still excited tho.
Considering OMORI was originally intended to be a graphic novel, I highly doubt this will be as bad as the yume Nikki manga.
i don't wanna be reminded of that lmao
there's a Yume Nikki manga
Genius, disaster, I just hope it’s not BORING. 💀
I wish there was an anime! 
First step for making an anime is to make a manga.
That's right! For now we just have to wait
Not necessarily, Cowboy Bebop was an anime without a manga series.
But having a manga makes it conciderably easier to create an anime. In my opinion it's only a matter of time.
Yeah, usually they literally use the manga as an anime storyboard.
Reminder. Angels of death and corpse party were rpg maker games that got turned into anime.. . I can definitively see this turned into anime eventually.
and I think Evangelion too? I might be 100% wrong tho
I would murder for an Omori anime  — a la Sapgoon’s videos 
Sapgoons animation style is borderline perfection for an Omori anime
We could get an anime adaption of the manga later 
[Link to tweet](). . Edit: Reassurance from the Artist of the manga adaptation (translated by Twitter): " I will be in charge of OMORI's comic adaptation for Afternoon! This is Konito stitching. It's okay!" ([Link if anyone needs it.]())
I need to know: *when* and *where*. . (But ig there's no info yet...)
We're all happy now but then we'll find out that the manga's ending isn't the good ending. And we'll be extremely sad
This is thr Omori Fandom, everyone is depressed
Nahh can you imagine that . . (It would be hilarious tho)
Imagine the manga has a different ending for each copy
My thoughts are that it's going to be, a choose your own ending for the finale
Not just the ending, you have to choose a route after chapter 10 or something (if the manga even gets to Kel knocking on the door that fast, I may be underestimating things)

I hope this can clear up some story misconceptions fans have about the game.  . We hardly have any details, so I will keep my expectations low for now.
The hype omg
The trauma is real💯💯💯
It's a great time to be an Omori fan
it’s always a great time to be an omori fan wdym /j
Oh my god, they did it, OMORIBOY 2!
YAYY
i know this is gonna have its own "nah, i'd win" panel. . 
. . Haha very funny. . (Every day, my sanity slips further away from my grasp.)
OMAGAH!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
How are you? Fine thank you?
OH MY GAHHHHH!!!!
I wish I were a bird. 🐦
Things have come full circle, just without the same artist.. . It can go well, it can not, we'll see.
Please don't let it be mid.
honestly cool but it'll never be him. . 
tru tru
If this is true, then nice!. . However an manga artist I would love to see do a graphic novel/manga adaption is junji ito. >!seriously image junji ito drawing stuff like black space and hellmari!<
I’m thrilled!! I love this game so much, and replaying the whole game every so often doesn’t sate my desire for Omori content. And playing more often than that isn’t possible due to how long it takes. I hope this can help fill the Omori-shaped void in my heart!
Ohmigosh I saw this and was about to let you know, but then I scrolled in the comments and sure enough you already knew \~! I’m so thrilled for this, too\~!
I was gonna tag you but I knew you’d find it anyways! 
Yep, of course I did \~!
I mean you could always check out theold  good Omori boy...
YEAH I SAW OMORI WAS TRENDING ON TWITTER SO I CHECKED AND THIS WAS THE FIRST THING I SEE
I first thought you meant combat. But I think you meant acting. Though it could still work in a manga.
It's more about the whole LOVE, SAVE and RESET mechanics
It could still work
Toby fox is working on a new game instead a manga
HOLYIJSIUOHUIHUIHHQHIQH???????????
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Holy shit Pale Machine 2 and this in one week, I am feasting like a king
if u don't mind me asking, what's pale machine 2?
AFAIK OMORI was planned to be a graphic novel, but now we get BOTH a game and a manga! I'm super duper excited.
We're getting one step closer to a new world order glory to omori
OMORI getting a manga adaptation implies there's a canon ending, unless the manga is separate from canon
NO WAYY??? YEAAHH !! 
YIPPEEE
I hope there'll be an english version
Finally a manga to compete with punpun
AYO
Never expected for omori to get Manga adaptation but this is big W.
Oh shut which route? Probably good end route? Would be super neat if they did both hospital end routes though. Like, you get the option to play or don’t play in game. Get the option to turn the page immediately(don’t play) or skip like 20 pages (play) and get true end. And if you just keep reading then you see both.
YEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!t5\31hpy:2477
*screams*
everyday we are getting closer and closer to an anime adaptation of omori
Will this have physical volumes?
If this is real, it would be interesting. I wonder if they’re focus more on the Dreamworld.. actually they might focus on the Dreamworld. And the real world.. maybe like light details.
Wow, i need this in my bookshelf as soon as It releases
Anyone know what this translates to?. . &#x200B;. . 
. . probably referring to “monthly Afternoon”
Wow, almost forgot this is here.
Omori anime went from a pipe dream to strangely a possibility
I’m interested in seeing how they handle the boss fights.
I NEED ALL MY BITCHES SAME COLOR AS DRAKE🔥🔥🙏🗣
LESSGOOO I'm excited! . . I have no idea who the artist is though
The manga art style looks like really good!
Excepting orange joe references
Omori will be real in 60 years🤯
How would one be able to get hold of the manga when it comes out? I have looked everywhere but I can’t find any information about it and it’s killing me
me too, bruh, ive been searching for release date and nothing 😭
LETSSS GOOOOOO  OMORI MANGA!!!!   . ok but either this is gonna be a bad manga adaption  or a good adaption!   . I'm really excited of the story its gonna take, for sure they are gonna take the game story but it has the option to give us the story on the beginning of Sunny's headspace which I'm really hoping for. (I WANT MANGA ART OF ABBI!!)  . The manga ending could give us the reactions of hero, kel and Aubrey to the truth
WHATTT
gadzooks
If this is real i will go feral 
AHHHHH !!!!!!! 
This is the best day of my fuking life les goooo
Hey if Among Us can get a manga adaptation this news is far from shocking
Among Us WHAT?? WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN!????
February of 2022 apparently.
Wow, I'm pretty out of date 🥲
GIVE ME IT NOW OR I'LL BREAK YOUR KNEECAPS.
I am going to buy that shit so fucking fast

WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE BOYS AND GIRLS! FIRST OMORIBOY COMICS, THEN A GAME, NOW BACK TO COMICS!!!
This just makes me ask the question of how this is going to work. . . Like is it going to be a direct adaptation of the game if so how are the endings going to fit into it? if not what is it going to be about?  I guess I'll have to wait until it gets released
HUH????? REALLY???. . 
Has this Nui Konoito drawn something else before this?. Really intrigued how the art is going to look and how they are going to portrait the story of the game
There's nothing on their Twitter profile and it searching them up gives no results. . . Guess we'll wait and see.
WE ARE SO FUCKING BACK
Yo this will be amazing. I’ll binge-read this manga :0
. . me rn:
I'm so excited! I've been recommending Omori to a friend for a while, she says she wants to play it but she thinks it's too long.
Oh yea. It was originally supposed to be a webcomic/manga but they decided to make it a game instead.
It's come full circle.
EXTREME HYPERHYPE . . Please let it be successful. Specially hyped if it is better, and gets to the level of angels of death or corpse party (rpg maker titles that got made into manga and then anime!!!!!)
fuck yes 
considering omori was SUPPOSED to be a webcomic originally, doesn't suprise me
I wonder what the story will be like.
What ending do you guys think the manga will follow?
i need this
OMG IM SO EXITED:2464:
YEEEEEEEEES
which ending do you guys the manga will take place in?
LET.HIM.COOK.
PEAK 
WoW this is amazing
I am not okay with any of this
YAAAAAY
LESSS GOOOOOO
OMGGG ITS REAL?????
[Hmm...]()
No fucking way

HERE, TAKE ALL MY LIFE SAVINGS 💳 💵
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
OH MY GOODNESS
well, i'm honestly looking forward on this 
Lets see how quick it'll get cancelled. . 
If it's getting a manga then it being made into an anime isn't an unlikely thing
i knew they going to make a omori anime and manga
Omor manga?!
j'adore le style artistique du manga, mais je trouve que les yeux d'Omori (manga) sont un peu agressif et dénigrant :grimacing:      (im french)
So excited this will be so cool.
i cant wait (no expresion)
It's releasing today, but is's banned in my region😭
WWWWWHHHHHHAAAAAT. . 
I hope is real... If it isn't well...
This is from the official twitter accountand instagram of the game and the artist for it tweeted too. It's real alright.
Do we have any idea of when it’ll start and how long it’ll be and if it’ll come out physically and if it’ll be in Japanese
WHAT!!!! /pos
It's official, [
If you’re reading this then your parents will die in 5 years. To undo this curse you have to paste this comment on 5 more Manga. I’m so sorry please forgive me. I didn’t want to risk it!
How much?
Bad idea
What is the point??? The game seemed to have told the story quite well on its own??? Wouldn’t a book-version of the story just condense everything the game offers into a rather inferior format?. . Now, I understand the visual aspect being an appeal here. However, I do not see why a series of interesting art book would not do the trick? Or something like a “Diary” of the protagonist, where we could get to read his thoughts with interesting visuals… Basically, something that is original, but still relates to the story in one way or another.
>What is the point??? The game seemed to have told the story quite well on its own???. . So the original medium must not have told the story quite well in order to warrant an adaptation? Because thats the implication from that statement. I'm sure no one would say Tolkien did a bad job telling the story of the Lord of the Rings with books, that didn't stop there being an adaptation.. . Look at plenty of other stories and their adaptations too, the original story can be very successful and still get an adaptation, whether the original game/book/manga/novel/show etc. told the story well already or not matters not at all.
Um…. I do not see the example you brought up really fitting with what we have going on with Omori: a game, with a lot of dialogue/descriptions and interesting visuals, is being translated into manga, which usually includes same things (although be slightly in a slightly different way). This manga will most likely be just a rather direct retelling of a story, which makes the story of Omori loose some of its unique charm (all of the little details, alternative endings, the music and a chance to have a unique take on the story thanks to all players having different playing styles and the game letting you explore the world in different ways).. . Unless, of course, the manga will have a unique take on the story going on. After all, it is an adaptation (I just really doubt it being so) :^. . . I also would like to point out a potential problem this manga may create for potential new fans, who can learn about Omori through the manga first - they will not have a true incentive to try and play the game after reading and learning the story, and that absolutely sucks. It is actually a problem with many books that went through the process of getting a visual adaptation.
To be fair, the game works so well because it's a video game. I'm fairly sure Omocat has said they decided to turn it int a game frm a comic since she realised the medium was perfect for that.  . . . Replicating that in a manga will be very difficult. I hope it turns out good and often adaptations never quite reach the same level of the original but it's understandable to be a bit skeptical.
I wont deny that i myself am cautiously optimistic, i only have a problem with the person saying that theres no reason for a justification because the original medium told the story well, thats not a reason for there to not be an adaptation, many adaptations are proof of that. Just because it wont be better or just because the original already told the story well is not a reason for no adaptation.
I am not trying to say that Omori cannot be adapted into a different medium (I lat some points in my life think about how cool of an animated series Omori can be). I am just saying, because most story adaptations are simply retellings of the story with much less intricate details, this manga announcement does not send good vibes (cause the game already offers a lot of the things this manga will as well as something that it will not).. . Also, I have suggested 2 different concepts for an Omori adaptation (one of which is story driven) that can be interesting fresh takes on the plot without actually changing the story that much or at all (if executed right).
>something that it will not).. . If i'm understanding correctly (it's 12 PM and i am tired), you are saying that the game offers the same things the manga will and more, but this goes both ways, because while a story is usually best in the medium it was originally told in, no medium is inherently superior in every regard to another imo. Off the top of my head, manga can most likely be more expressive with the facial expressions than the game was for example, have more of them too. The game will offer things a manga can't, and the manga will offer things the game can't.. . This is true with a book too of course, a book or diary would offer things a game can't, the game would offer things a book or diary can't. My point is that no medium for an adaptation should be dismissed, unless the story really doesn't fit the medium, and i don't think Omori is that incompatible with a manga. A diary may offer things the game can't, but i believe a manga can offer things the game can't too.
I am not saying it will offer the same thing, but that it MOST LIKELY will. This has only been announced. I, just like any other people on this thread, have shared my first impressions about the announcement. My opinion just happens to be “I think this may be just a repackaged game experience with less content; this is not that cool if it is”.. . Also, I do not denounce Omori of a manga adaptation. The cast of the game is quite literally drawn like stylised Japanese cartoon characters. I, once again, just am not fond of this manga potentially being a direct adaptation.. . I say we stop here. I did not expect my opinion to turn into such discussion. Thank you for an interesting conversation.
The point of an adaptation is to adapt it into another medium, not improve the story.
Okay? My first comment has a part about how Omori could have been adapted into some book form without it coming across like when some people can replace “-“ with “:” in a sentence, without changing its meaning… I simply do not want the Omori fan base to get stuck in a “marvel loop”, consuming the same exact product in different packages. I have already seen it happening in some other communities I am a part of and this one has pretty much good soil for such thing.
With all due respect, you can simply not engage with the community anymore if slight disagreements caused by different adaptations bothers you so much. This is a complete nothingburger of a complaint.
Um-. I do not like how comments can be misinterpreted on internet 😅. I engage with this fandom in a very passive manner. Even the prospect of this game being deleted forever with anyone having no ability to play it does not phase me. Moreover, I find the idea of me overreacting about anything related to this game (including this manga adaptation) to be rather silly.. . If my opinion and/or my point about “marvel loop” bother(s) you that much, than let me say this:. . With my opinion regarding the announcement I simply expressed that 1) I think this may be a direct adaptation and 2) If it is, than I don’t think it is a great idea or a good thing for the community. . Simple as that. Do with that what you will as long as you understand this is just an opinion.. . Thank you for your concern, but there is nothing of that sort)
Why have such a concern for a community you apparently don’t care about? Doomposting about a manga adaptation that was just recently announced is kind of weird, especially since we haven’t even seen evidence that it’ll just be a 1:1 adaptation of the game.
I mean this in a concerned way: I think you need a reality check, because none of my comments on this thread are written with the intention of doom-posting. If my opinions make you so heated (cause I do not know how one can look at my comments and say I am really doom-posting, I just showed basic skepticism on the level of personal opinions), than you have a problem. . Now, the part about the “marvel-loop” may be a bit too much, but I just tried to describe one of the reasons why I am skeptical, why I am not instantly on board with this announcement (unlike other folks), and that is just that. It is not to develop fear in others of “what’s to come”. What is going to happen is not dependent on me, but on the community at large (and everyone who delivers official content). Remember - I am passive when it comes to interacting with the fandom.. . I am stopping this reply section here. I do not think it is healthy to continue keeping it going for either one of us. Have a good day
Huh? Passive when it comes to interacting with the fandom, yet you wrote paragraphs worth of content about how skeptical you are about the project? Lol ok.. . By all means, criticize the manga once it's already out and it turns out to be bad, but going on and on about how it's a bad thing for the community before even seeing a single page just reeks of doomposting. You called the manga format inferior in your very first post, so don't even pretend that you're approaching this topic with an open mind.
Why does he look like that 
wasnt omori already gonna get a manga adaptation
So how they gonna pull off any of the sound-important things?. . How they gonna pull off the final?
Hopefully it covers the good ending of the game, otherwise, this comic would be terrible.
A Omori manga is weird to me. It's a game steeped in idealised American suburbia.
Being a manga doesn’t require the story to be set exclusively in Japan. See the JoJo series.
It's a matter of perspective. Though I note that a writer isn't mentioned...
OMGOMGOMGOMGAAAAAAAAA
 PEOPLE FEAR ME 
Neat
Omori got me acting up. Who can relate?
Is this a good game? Someone gifted it to me but it looked weird
Yeah. If you're sensitive to themes such as suicide, anxiety and depression, then you might want to avoid it (and also flashing lights) but the game's great. A bit of a slow start but you get into it with time.  . . . My only reccomendation for you without spoiling anything is that when you reach a point where the games asks you to open a door during the day, open it. It's more ideal for your first time playing if you do that. You'll know what I mean when you get there.
You are in the subreddit for the game, of course you'll be told it's good. What exactly do you mean by weird?. . Do you like RPGs? Do you like psychological horror? And as the game warns, theres depictions of depression, anxiety and suicide, theres flashing imagery if you have epilepsy. Is that all good with you? Then play it. You wont truly know if you'll enjoy a game or not without playing it.
Assuming this is real, or happening, will it tell the same story as any of the routes, or do something different?
Why did everyone decided to pick Omori up suddenly? First the figurines at Goodsmile, and now this ..
I pitch we nickname the manga as OmoriMan. kinda obvious reasoning but then we can say 'Omoriboy grew up to be Omoriman'.
Junji Ito OMORI adaptation when
I think I saw somewhere a teaser of something in netflix callled 'face the truth, Omori'
headspace becomes grayspace
gayspace
"Welcome to Gayspace, you have been gay here for as long as you can remember."
"everything is going to be gay"
Gayting for something to happen?
Do you want to gay the door?

No homo here.
It's a big closet, do you want to be gay?
Yes i do
[all-gay]
Wokemori
Help thats what i read it as the first time- (im dyslexic 💀)
Headspace becomes white space 2 (does this count as a spoiler? Does me asking this at the end of a comment make it obvious that it could qualify as one? Why’d I confirm it? Should I delete this part of the comment?)
Litteraly one of the First messages in the game "welcome to White space" 
>!White space 2 opposites black space 2!<
I Think Its vague enough to not be a spoiler
Well that area is more of a secret than plot so not really
Nah, not really. I don’t think it would be very viable for the entirety of headspace to be colored. It would add a nice vibe though.
I mean there are weekly manga that are coloured, it's rare but not impossible, through its normally only the web version, the volumes are  normally in black and white(shadows house is the only example I can think but still, its something)
I mean there are 3 reasons why manga is black and white and not full color (aside the occasional full color spread). . 1. it's easier printing in black and white compared to color. . 2. by now it's just tradition to keep it black and white. . 3. it's also easier on the mangaka that do manga weekly if it is all black and white. . I mean if someone wants in color manga there are 3 great sources for that. . 1. sometimes publishers publish official colored versions of the manga (jojo does this). . 2. fan colorings are also a thing. . 3. korean manhwa is almost alleays in color
I think it would be cool if headspace was black and white, but had little bright details. Some light purple tracing, small highlights, tiny details that says “this is headspace” without fully coloring the entire page
I mean I get the idea behind it but it will either be fully colored (ehichbit won't) or black and white. . however what could happen is that they use gray scale shading in a clever way or other shading techniques to imply color
Yeah it was just a quick idea in my head bc I feel like new audiences might be confused on whether the chapter currently takes place in headspace or the real world
yeah no I get that it would be cool but I'm just explaining why it won't happen
True, like a manga called “The Guy She Is Interested In Wasnt A Guy At All” where it has minimal coloring using black, white and green to highlight some of the elements and make it pop. . . If omori did similarly with a bright purple, black and white color palette im sure itll look pretty neat
On the second point, there are neat tools that uses machine learning for coloring manga pages.
true but like manual colored most of the times looks better since a real human understands color better than machine learning. . not saying it can't work but a real human (or even better the original creator) will have better undersstanding on what colors work for specific characters or scenes compared to machine learning that lacks the human understand of why and only knows how
Do you know how long it would take to color in all of headspace? It would look great but it would take forever and just be a pain for the artists to do
i feel like just making it purple instead fixes this issue, but i feel black and white is standard in manga so we just have to put up with it. I hope there is something else to differentiate it atleast.
It's a manga what were you expecting? I do hope they have a color page when he first enters headspace kinda like the original *omori's story* comic.. . 
I've seen manga where certain aspects like only the eyes are colored.
The katakana is アフタヌーン (afutanuun) - "Afternoon". It's a manga magazine that releases monthly, with Morning and Evening releasing weekly and biweekly respectively. Afternoon is known for publishing Vinland Saga, Skip and Loafer, Parasyte, Weathering with You, 5 Centimeters per Second, etc.. . Omori comes from hikikomori, social recluses who typically stay locked in their rooms. What you've found was おもい (omoi), sometimes you'll hear it used as either weight like heavy, or emotions.
How else would they do it. It’s a manga not a graphic novel.
Ermm idk. Maybe change the black to a dark purple when Omori is in headspace
Replace the black ink in the printer with purple 
Why *is* every manga black and white, anyways?. . Like isnt this manga published digitally? Not like the printers and ink would be an issue.. . Obviously, it would be a hassle to colorize it, so obviously i'm not going "YOU HAVE TO ADD COLOR NOW!!!!!" or anything, but like western comics are usually in color and they're mostly made for print
said it in a reply to someone else already but. . 1. it's was easier to print back when most sales of manga where digital. . 2. it's easier on the mangaka (who already have very tight deadlines) even if they have other staff. . 3. it's also kinda the tradition by now. . solutions would be. . 1. official colored versions from the publishers after black and white release (like jojo for example). . 2. fan colorizations. . 3. korean manhwa are mostly all in color
Most comics/graphic novels/webtoons that aren't manga are in colour now.
Ik, that's my point - why is manga usually in black and white when most other comics are colored?
honestly I kinda like it. it keeps prices down for print readers, creates an opportunity for more efficient releases, and allows readers a chance to imagine the colors—or just enjoy the art without them.. . but that’s more from a business and personal standpoint. truth is, if there’s a color option, it’s usually the one I would prefer to read
Most comics/graphic novels/webtoons aren't published weekly.
i mean thats how manga is, there’s probably gonna be a coloured version released eventually
Ngl,i kinda forgot that the manga is Releasing Monday. . . But yeah,it's a bit cursed but i don't see any other way of doing it.
oh it is? didn't even know it was this soon
On Monday? That's cool! Also (just speaking to the crowd here) where could I get it when it releases if anyone knows? Like, physical copy not an app( I know it's releasing on some app I think?)
just imagine the colors lol
no
thats how mangas work

i do kinda wish that headspace was outlined in a dark purple at least (with omori being the exception), but i don't know how possible that could be with manga 
. . I colored it
My lord and my god.
No
no
no
And time for me to powerscale them
Do you know when an English version comes out (I don't really know much about manga)
Monday on the K Manga app 
It makes sense but at the same time, it really takes away from the dream-like state of headspace.
Am I the only one who still feels that headspace has so much color yet it’s black and white?
Нет
no
When will the manga release? Will it be by chapter or just the whole thing itself lol
it'll come out on 24th of June at 8am PDT on K Manga, it'll just be by chapter :P
Woah tomorrow then :))) i hope someone talented tries to color this manga, bcuz it is colorless (manga) is a bit of a downside.
I wonder what they would do with >!black space!<, if they ever choose to show it
>!They might invert the color palette. Where Headspace has black outlines and white backgrounds, Blackspace might have black background and white outline.!<
Kool shit
Where will i be able to read it?
On The sofa, Bed, Toilet, And more places.. . . . . . Oh. You meant it that way? No clue.
It will be released on K Manga, but only in the US iirc
definitely but unfort thats how manga works 😔
I think it would be funny if people become fan of Omori thanks to the manga and then find out about the game being 50 shades of purple.
I think adding some color to real world and headspace and making >!black space and some of the more intense parts of the story!< black and white would be a cool tonal shift.
Is it out yet?
I heard from others here it's releasing on monday

bro it looks so sad headspac represents the happy moments in life broooo
I get why it's in black and white, but it would be nice if they did something like Shojo Beat and had a different color ink, at least for the headspace part. However, I get that may be more work to have 2 different ink colors 😞
Omor
Man katakana is so easy to forget I wish Japanese people preferred hiragana instead 💀
1 word, manga
So when is it gonna release?. . 
Tuesday
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO. . 
It’s cursed but nothing too bad
It's just a difference in style. No big deal.
Omori doesnt have to be grayscale alone anymore :D
Like most manga there will probably be a fan coloured version eventually
No not really since manga's are usual to black and white (also its already out or is it a teaser?)
No
Not really cause I’m used to reading Manga in Black and White, but I can see how that would be off putting given the story and all. . . I’m sure there will be an official or unofficial colorization at some point once things kick off
It's definitely going to be colored by fans at one point, so if you want the coloured headspace experience just wait for that. . Also is the manga already out? I haven't been keeping up with it's development
No way... is it out yet?!?!? 
No, 25th
Of june?
Off topic, what is even going to be happening in the manga? Like a retelling of the story or just stories from Headspace? Will we see the real world at all?
According to some tweets, the manga is the game's story, but told in a way that will be fun for both Omori players and those that haven't played it.
WHEN THE FUCK IS THIS COMING OUT
25th
25TH OF WHAT????
June
Is it June or July I forgot
June
Omanga in 4 days
It's allredy out? (Yes i'am stupid)
on 25th
Probably would have cost a shit ton more money but it would be interesting if they made all the backgrounds like the deep blue they do for the friends in headspace
YES! *Becames a no more innocence mode*. . 
"Based on ***an*** indie video game" seems like a weird way to put it.
Well, it's an indie, not a indie.
But it's *the* indie.
> OMORI MANGA. > ⠀. > Based on the indie game by OMO🐱CAT. . I'm not sure how to make the correlation any more obvious than it is. The reader automatically knows by virtue of the title that the game must also be called Omori, because otherwise it would have been noted. "An indie video game" implies that the game is NOT titled Omori, and/or that OMO🐱CAT has multiple titles under their belt.
You keep saying the description does not address which inside game we're talking about, except it's right there on the top cover. It's Omori. Anyone buying it is buying the "Omori manga". No one is looking at the title and being like "hmm, I wonder what game this is referring to".. . Where even is this description you keep stubbornly referring to?
. . Likely nobody buying this manga would ask themselves that question, but that still misses the point, that in a vacuum the description does not refer to the "indie video game" in question.. . You can argue that the description wouldn't apply in the real world all you want, but it is still correct.
So, wait, are you saying that the line "Based on an indie video game" is the description you're talking about? 'Cause if it is, it's not in a vacuum, unless you're willfully refusing to look at the rest of the cover.. . The context is impossible to miss. The article used should have been "the". There is no scenario where the description so posted will be divorced from the rest of the cover.
Fun fact: this manga means we might get an Omori Anime
2 downvotes 💀💀
we don't need an anime
Yeah. . Like it came straight of a Manga too
One punch man lmao
Hell naw, not an anime, the slop of a manga is enough. . Besides it would be the same quality as the merch, I doubt you’d want to watch a slideshow
I mean personally I think it would be good I would like to hear how the characters sound
I don’t :p I lowkey dgaf
Oh well fair enough 😭 honestly I do love some of the merch but the stuff like the perfume is just stupid
could only use one panel of the manga here because they’ve held hands in it like 15 times by now not even joking these two are superglued together with red strings
*Inhales*. . #GAAAAAAAAAAAAY
SUPERGLUED PLEASE I love that. Fate said they were gonna converge again and again, whether they want it or not.
The first chapter of the manga confirmed that. I think.
It’s completely worth it- there are Some aspects that didn’t age well (it’s old and the reboot stays pretty true to the original stuff)- but if you love seemingly innocent sweet things that are pretty dark I can reccomend it . . But just watch the reboot - the art is better, super close to the manga storyline, and actually has an ending . . The tldr summary is:. . A family was cursed generations ago that a few select members would transform into a zodiac animal when hugged by the opposite gender. At any given Generation there’s one person per zodiac and it’s a heavily guarded secret fully of love and trauma that a random girl gets mixed up in one day
Brother if you're familiar with the confusing mess that is the 2003 version of FMA them you already know I prefer the version of anything that follows the manga closer. . . Sounds like a... Strange plot? So it's a show about hugging? I mean fuck it I'm down, no spoilers. Let's find out which senpai hugs which kohai and let's see what weird shit happens as a result thereof.
Then yessss- let me know how it goes - I’m in the market for an anime/ gaming buddy to talk shop with beings I can’t convince most of my friends to watch it with me
Well. Cool. Just got done with episode 14. Thanks, I fucking hated it. Off to watch more I GUESS.... UGH
. . LETS GOOO

Lemme get in on that. .

this image is unsettling.
I only noticed it now

Day cake happy!

HAPPY DAY OF THE CAKE
This gif is def a “tell me you’re older than 20 without telling me you’re older than 20” moment (and I approve )
Now, then the question is which ending will it have or will it have a completely original ending?
Maybe they’ll tackle both routes somehow
The only way I could think of them even doing that would be if they made it somehow where he survives the bad ending and then in the second season, they tackled the good route
That’s not konoito’s art style and the translated text surrounding it has jackshit to do with the omori manga
I want a totally original ending maybe a bit happier.
It’s not just in Japanese, right?
if not it’ll get translated by non official translators fast. Considering it’s for originally english media it may get a official english translation right away
Me summoning TCBscans to translate the OMORI manga (idfk if they actually would)
does that mean it wouldnt be a physical copy? i was hoping an english version of the manga (as a real book) would come out on june 25
They said preparations for an official English translation are underway. I highly doubt we will see the official English translation in july either.. . I might be wrong with what I am about to say because I am unfimilair with how kodansha (the people publishing the omori manga) handle their magazines, but usually the magazine will only contain 1 chapter. 1 physical books consists of multiple of these chapters. So if kodansha work like other manga magazines, it will be a while until we get a whole physical book. As we will have to wait for the required amount of chapters to complete a whole volume.. .   . Edit: I've just read online it will be the release of the first chapter on june 25th, so yeah we will have to wait a while before they release physical books anywhere in the world. A volume is usually around 8ish chapters soooo if the manga is weekly itll take around 8 weeks, but if its monthly it may take less than 8 months as the chapters will be larger due to them coming at less frequent
The official Twitter account confirmed an english translation in being made
Good.
. . The month long wait will be a painful one
Keep strong, we are so close!
It’s been 4 years in the making (sorta), stay strong and wait a month if you can
. . Gohan vs Buu

I'm sure it'll be decent, but it'll only be peak depending on what changes they make when adapting it. . . What do y'all think they'll do?
I hope they make an English translation. I love omori but I don’t speak japanese
They will
Gaahh a release date?! So soon. I was prepared to wait longer but cool
Same! I really thought it was gonna be 2025 sometime but this is crazy!

wonder if there’ll be unanswered questions that’ll be solved here. or a canon ending/timeline of events from the game. either way, it’ll be the first i ever read.

They knew how fruity the characters are so they knew they had to release the manga in June
Already? I mean honestly i expected it would take a lot longer but hey,i'm not complaining.
HYPE.
HELL FUCKING YES
My wallet hearing this information: 
. . YAY
. . i used to pray for times like this🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
THAT'S MY BIRTHDAY GUYS
YOOOO IT’LL BE THE BEST BIRTHDAY GIFT EVER
I can just imagine people asking what you want and when they research about it they just get more and more concerned about your mental health
Crazy

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
AHHHHHHHHHHH IM SO FREAKING EXCITED!!!! THIS IS LITERALLY ME RN:. . 
Yay on my birthday :3
YESSSS!!!!!!!!!!t5\31hpy:28764

YESSSS

YES!!!!!!
MY DAD SAID I CAN GET ANYTHING FOR MY GRADUATION AND THIS RELEASES 5 DAYS AFTER.... SHOULD I??

A week before my birthday!! 
1 day after my birthday? I already know where my money will end up

So like, 3 days after spring.... Damn
IF THEY DON'T TRANSLATE IT I AM LEARNING TO READ JAPANESE
this one's goin in the calendar
Me and the boys going to not sleep for 20 days:
Will there be an English translation?
IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING OMG
YES
AAAAA I C A N N O T WAIT
Where did you find omori on there. I can't find it.

they said spring --
better than nothing 
True. False advertising 👎
Omori anime, when?
I dislike that the manga is going to be probably in Japanesse, and i will not be able to buy and read a real copy.
…Mangas are made in Japan…there’s translations…go learn Japanese if you’re so worried about it…
Yeah, sure but translations gonna be available on web only, which sucks.
…Then go on the web and read it there then…

You didn’t even get my name right, also, gonna be honest here, your handwriting is shittier than mine somehow, and mine is already bad. . Also, I’ll be waiting for it
I’m surprised you have this random collection of memes, or whatever this is, but please, just use the text tool, I can barely read what R stands for in ‘SMART’, and what my own user is in that image. . Also, learn how to spell, I swear you’ve spelt my name incorrectly twice, and you also spelt ‘metaphysically’ wrong as well
Average neckbeard discord moderator response:. . . . . . . P.S - Learn to read
I cannot tell if that’s (your) alt or smth, but you’re telling me that you read the written thing for R in ‘SMART’ in 1 go, and didn’t have to read it multiple times just to understand it? . . Didn’t think I’d be arguing with an illegible writer over a well-made game getting a manga but not having the base language being English when mangas are normally made in Japan after finally finishing high school for good

Someone who doesn’t have illegible writing, but still can’t spell…. . Anyways, I need sleep, it’s 22:35, todays been a long day, let me sleep
btw is just a 22:36
You’re a minute behind now, it’s 23:37 now
awww, im sorry, but youre hour behind is 23:39 now.
I think I’ll just sleep, I’m too tired for this shit, the longer this goes the less sleep I get and the more people I seem to be contacted by randomly
sleepy boi, go for it.
:3

\^\\^
It sounds like you're referring to an image with text that's difficult to read and has some spelling errors. Here's the corrected information for you:. . 1. **SMART Goals**:.    * **S**: Sad.    * **M**: Metaphysically.    * **A**: Autistic.    * **R**: Reaching maximum level of cringe.    * **T**: Trash Kid. 2. If your name was misspelled, I apologize for that. Please provide your correct name so I can ensure it's spelled correctly in future communications.. 3. The correct spelling of "metaphysically" is as shown here.. . If there are any other specific details or corrections you need, feel free to let me know
Suddenly went all serious and official. Surprising, and I didn’t mention the ‘metaphysically’ because I already stated too much.. . Anyways, I can’t tell if you wrote that or if an AI wrote that, but I don’t care, I need sleep (it’s 22:27, early for me), good night and/or good day
Wish that were me.. . Night
Sleep well
MANGA IS LITERATURE!
azumanga and dragon ball fans are the anime version of this
Is it shown in the actual game, though? It seems that in the manga it would be 4 years, but considering how many differences are in the manga compared to the game, including time shifts, they're basically different canons.. . Without this being shown in the main game, there’s no indication that it was 4 years since >!Mari died!< in the game canon.. . If you've seen me say this twice, it's because I forgot the spoiler.
This is the person who should have drawn the manga
This is the same manga where a chainsaw devil can erase concepts and is one of the strongest in the verse. It’s fine
Probably some forgotten chainsaw war or something that got erased already. Or they live in a world where chainsaws are functionally different from what we understand as chainsaws.
There are 2 chainsaw man’s so maybe this isn’t even the real chainsaw man and someone stronger
I believe fakesaw man was a result of the fire devil, but that could be a possibility. I think chainsaws resembling something even more powerful would be cool.
What the hell is this manga? I need to read this.....
It’s rad, sad, really well written, and is overall fantastic! It’s a romance, a shonen, a workplace sitcom, all at once.
gaming setup, a desk with art and drawing tools, a tablet, many anime figurines and plushies, manga books, my computer, basically stuff that weebs have
People look at everything the manga artist draws in a weird way for some reason
Yeah, like you do apparently.
It's just a joke
the artist drew that kinda stuff before being hired to work on the manga so yeah the person youre replying to is 100% correct
this is manga tho. . have you seen how fast quality manga gets produced
some manga have more than one artist producing it, because of the brutally short time they have to work on it. but then again, this doesnt apply to all manga, because not all artists/authors have strict time constraints to produce them in - while im no expert, nor do i know for sure, im sure this would be the case for an omori manga, id imagine that theyre much more concerned about making a quality product than getting it out quickly and efficiently, especially when they dont necessarily need to
you’re a genius
i wish
We have to consider multiple things:. . 	1. There is a difference between an ongoing series and a greenlit project. Announcements are made way before a project is released.. . 	2. Drawing is only one aspect of manga. It also needs story direction, especially if it is an adaptation of a game (or source material in general). The story of OMORI as we know it so far was told through the game itself, but we don't know how well it will translate into manga.. . We should Remember to Be Patient when it comes to art. Given enough time, the manga could possibly turn out to be good.
Have you heard how terrible working conditions are in the manga and anime industries? If not, I'd recommend you to do some research. It's really eye-opening. . . That high quality stuff you're reading is created by people who sleep less than 6 hours a night and spend their waking hours almost exclusively on working. . . That's not the kind of working environment I wish upon anyone. The people behind the Omori manga are hopefully being given a much healthier and more humane schedule and workload.. . I don't know enough about Kodansha as a publisher to know the kind of demands it makes of its employees.
you haven't drawn a thing in your life have you

To a fault, after all. In the case with the work culture surrounding manga, the amount of abuse that a mangaka and their team is dealt is intangible to one who separates themselves from their art.. I agree with the other comments– this manga is a greenlit project, it is absolutely not an ongoing series and nor has it even been serialised yet, lending the process to its publishing to be more strict, particularly under Kodansha.
Mangakas arent known to have great quality of life. Theyre often miserable due to how much work they have to do to fit in weekly deadlines for those that are ongoing series.. . Heck even then, for One Piece and Naruto that have 700+ chapters over 20 years, there are others like Berserk with 300 chapters accross 30 years and there are countless smaller series and one shots that didnt take a week to make.
\*Breaks in on a skateboard\*  . . . And have you seen the artists working conditions?
There's also a huge difference in "I'm writing one of the top manga in the world and I have to destroy my health to remain relevant and pump this out as fast as possible weekly"  . . . and  . . . "Cool we picked up the rights to make a manga of unknown scope and length about an indie game."  . . . Are they supposed to blitz this project for no particular reason? lol.
ur mentally ill and shouldn’t be on the internet lil man. . not even as an insult (its against the rules) its for ur own good
Video game is harder to make than manga
Welll my point still stands it should take atkeast a year since there’s hundreds of things to consider such as routes, function integration (ex: hangman) design (converting characters into a new art style)
3 months seems way too short to start publishing a whole professional manga.
it depends. if they release chapters individually before doing a full volume release, then it would be weekly or in this case probably monthly like most most mangas. but since this is a new thing, it'll probably wanna build some buffer before it starts releasing, just to be safe
Don't rush the steak boy,let them cook it real good.. . Took 6 years for Omori to come out,we have the patience to wait a few more weeks...or months.. . ^(good thing I'm not the one making this manga otherwise it would take three years for it to come out like the one I'm making,so be thankful for that.)
Or years :3
3 years to make a manga? (I kinda want to make my own manga despite having no experience)
Kinda...3 years to draw the first chapter.... . 15 years (and counting) planning the whole story.. . ...now,I am supposed to be used as an indication of what is "normal" I am an anomaly in every sense of the word when it comes to being a mangaka so don't assume you or anyone else,even the most famously insane of manga artists to take even 1/100th of what I took to do mine, I am an exception,not the rule.. . Now with that said, I fully encourage you to start, you're not gonna acquire experience doing manga by Not doing it so even if you think it's absolute dog shit or you don't know the first thing about paneling, don't let that stop you.. . And if you have any specific or general questions about literally anything, I'm always happy to help,cuz I sure didn't get any,so I'll do the good thing and offer you some advice if you want.
Would that be a studio or a single person also would have they not been somewhat close to finishing when they announced it a lot of games or moves would be announced like 4 months before release
Or even years
NEWSFLASH: IT TAKES MORE THAN 3 MONTHS TO MAKE A MANGA
are they releasing the entire manga in 1 go?
i dunno bru, even if they release only one volume it would still take more than 3 months
yeah, but thats not how kodansha does things, they do monthly magazines and online releases same day, they expect chapters to be done by then, not for volume releases every year. the manga industry is brutal so its honestly kinda surprising its not already being put out
ok
OP when they find out it takes more then 3 months to make an entire manga
I mean. making a manga probably takes a good while. the game took 8 years. unless it gets confirmed cancelled I’m just glad we have the closure that it is coming and that it does officially exist.
Mangas take a loooong time to make son
Not every manga is gonna get released like a Shonen. Some take a while to release.
A manga doesn't take 3 months to release. Chill
You think a manga series takes less than 3 months to plan, write, sketch, put together and share with the world??? Try making one, a good one announce it and get back to me in a month.
"A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad". . I know there is no such thing as a delay for the manga but if it were to be delayed, I would still be patient and wait for it.. . The key takeaway is I rather the manga take its time and be a forever masterpiece, than rushed to be finished early or even time and be forever mediocre at best and disappointing at worst.
7 years for the game. . 7 years for the manga (joke)
you tr making a manga
I'm still hoping for DT chapter 3-4 and you're over there questioning about the release day of the manga that hasn't been announced in 3 months. 3 MONTHS.
I mean, online manga takes one month to translate a chapter to English, that would be three chapters in those 3 months. But, it hasn’t been published at all yet, there still creating it
Bro does NOT know how much time it takes to produce a manga
um… art takes time?? imagine how much they have to draw and scan to make the manga, then translate the manga into english, considering it’s likely going to be in japanese first. give it time and let them work,
Can YOU make a manga in 3 months?
Are you 12? Do you know how long it takes to produce a manga?
Be patient. Do you know how long manga takes to make? Especially with one person?
wait, THERES GOING TO BE A OMORI MAnGA???!!!
mfs when they realize a full blown manga of a game that has 20 hours of playtime is going to take a long time to make: . . &#x200B;. . 
T\T mate, the actual game took 6 years to make and you're expecting them to get the manga out in 3 months?. . Y'all haven't learned anything.
This is probably an unpopular opinion but I’m not really a fan of the art style of the manga. It kinda seems like a common generic manga art style and loses a lot of the uniqueness present in the original art style in the game. I know they can’t just copy the original art style but I feel like they could have let some of that uniqueness and whimsy seep into the manga art.
Can you draw a manga in 3 months?
It’s only been 3 months lol manga takes time to get written and drawn. Whenever it does come out though I can’t wait to read it!
how long do you think it takes to make a manga
binge the entire thing, make a 3 paragraph essay on everything that's inaccurate to the manga and/or video game. 
I knew the Manga was coming out, but I didn't know it was welcome BACK to whitespace! Now I'm triple excited! 
Yw! And it will eventually get an English translation, but that’s when it’s being produced a lot faster and there are quite a few chapters out! It’s like any normal manga :)
I haven't read the manga in months, lmao this actually looks like a shonen now
Where can you watch the omori manga in pt br?
Está e a parte engraçada, você não acha
A
Haven’t read the manga, did he do the thing? Where he goes all inverted colors? Please tell me he did that
dumb question but why isn’t manga considered spoiler warning material
I did not read the manga, and I think I can wait until someone posts the PDF of it… no matter if it's considered theft.. . OMORI did not succumb, instead he wept.
Bro this looks lame af 😭 it actually comes across as badass in the game but his edgy anime face really isn't doing the manga any favors


don't you compare this to the lord and savior.. . you are NOTHING like him.
Nuh uh he's literally me
No. He is much MUCH greater than you.
Nuh uh
Fym nuh uh. He died on the cross and took the punishment for all of our sins, can you even come close to that kindness or greatness?
I'm just that cool
NO THE FUCK YOU ARENT
Nuh uh
I'm so fucking done with this. Just piss off already. 
You replied to their comment??
fyi the post is nonsense, there's zero link between the stuff featured and the omori mangaka (trust me i tried looking)
Oh, really? That explains why I couldnt find much
Looking at the number of upvotes on the sauciest comments that aren't outright deleted, it is blatantly obvious that the people who like it *vastly outnumber* the people that don't.. . The people complaining about it comprise the majority of comments (obviously, because anything else is banned- remember, posting the manga is breaking the subreddit's rules already) but the majority of actual engagement (and the number of top-level posts) does not actually come from them even though it often appears that way.
Probably gonna sound dumb: what’s the name of the Manga?
I Stayed Indoors For 4 Years And Became a Silent Boy Who Goes On Colorful Adventures With My Crush In My Dreams

Was hoping to not read this today :( why
where to read ch2 i cant acces kodansha/k manga from here
I personally used privado vpn on my phone its pretty much free :3
people have it posted on tiktok and twitter 🤩
The mangaka is into this stuff and so is the creator of the game, it’s hypocritical for you to stay in the fandom if your are so against it.
idk why you're getting downvoted for stating a fact lol
They have no way to dispute it, they’re teetering between “fiction is real” and, now knowing about the creators for something they’re obsessed with, “fiction isn’t real.”
That’s why I didn’t read the manga😭 it just looks so weird, why are they all like that
Where can I read the second chapter . . it's not available in my region and I can't find the English version in mangadex
you could be able to find it on tiktok or twitter !!
Because it's a manga, it's standard nowadays.... .   . I try to mentally ignore it
I mentally implement it 🗣‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥
Omori confirmed gamer
he playing with his life 🥰
Stop this madness !
manga is quickly becoming the topic of war on this sub
why is that?
because the mangaka is a weirdo and the manga itself has been dissapointing for a lot of people
he's omoriboy
Hmmm 🤔 🤨
Embrace thigh highs. They comfy
Idk but they do suit him 🤷‍♀️
um let's give him long sleeves then?? what
everyone is questioning if he's a crossdresser or not rn lmao. clothing CHANGES a lot no matter what kind of piece it is
what
what
I always thought they were boots until I looked at art outside of the game
he walks around without shoes </3
FEMBOY OMORI
I was ripping my hair out fr fr
And so what ?
because the artist is weird
Who's the artist/What are they doing that's weird?
I agree
Wow Omori is a femboy.. Never knew...
get a grip
I can’t take it anymore

I picked those up at a manga store in Tokyo too!! I couldn't resist even though I thought it was too advanced for me to read lol. I've been going through it and I'd say if you're N4 level in Japanese you should be good, but there's still kanji I need to look up throughout it. Mostly dialogue and not much walls of text (looking at you HunterxHunter manga...) which also helps!
The holy grail of manga
Guys, doujins are just fan-made manga, it doesn't have to be NSFW.
Yh guy got downvoted for asking a simple question lmao. Doujin can imply either self published or fan work. It doesn't need to be anything erotic or 18+ unlike the connotation most people have with the word 'doujin'.
Nah, it's the official manga. Omori doujins sounds cold asf, though.
Nice. There's a ton of doujins at smaller shops when I visited Japan. Some look like official prints.
Is it the same story as the game?
I believe so. A couple of major changes have been made, but I think it mostly follows the same plot points.
No tf? Those are the official manga
Doujins just means fan-made manga, it doesn't have to be NSFW.
Oops
Exactly ! Sure he is a fictional character, and the game makes him look like a "weak little boy", but sometimes it's pushing it too far imo. I guess the manga wanted to portray him like the fans see him
I honesty think that this is due to the author past more than anything.
I haven't really looked into the author past and other works, so I didn't take that into consideration, but I guess you're right as I assume you know at least a bit
Again if the mods didn't censored everything I could have tell you without problems but since they are so determined to not talk about anything linked to that even when it concerned a potential scandal and the true reasons why many people has a problem with the manga, in a M rated games who has many sensible subject like suicide psychological trauma and when everyone do canibalist jokes, you understand why many people hates them.
>but since they are so determined to not talk about anything linked to that. . The community the mods want can't exist by its own rules because the source material makes that impossible, so they don't want the reasons why talked about.  Simple as.. . >the true reasons why many people has a problem with the manga. . If they don't like the manga for whatever reason, they don't have to read the manga, and they can complain about how it offended their morality by existing somewhere else.
Well... sure there are worse but I don't think this is totally nothing, specially when your the main artist of the manga.
Nah this is a massive nothing burger. This fanbase of hypocrites regularly does/says much worse to these characters
True but there's also a part who totally reject that and I think this is harsh to put everyone on the same bag.
I feel like the manga artist made all the male characters look a bit too effeminate. Not that there's anything wrong with feminine men, I just don't think most of them are really like that in the game.
You’re right, but I just think it’s amusing.

Real 
Sir that is a child

😨
Search the author of the mangas and you will have you answers.
Well he's not going to be in much of the manga overall, may as well make him as showy as possible so you remember what he looks like by the time you get to the Last Resort and then you can draw a picture to jog your memory but wait what was his name again and why are you looking for him?
Yeah but they will probably showing image of him or even add more scene I think.

There's a damn manga???? Damn mate. I'm buying it right now
First time reading a more current manga?. . . 🤭🤭🤭
the manga really just twinkified everybody

IN ENGLISH ???
Mhm! Both languages are releasing at the same time!. . Edit: Almost the same time… Apparently, the Japanese version is releasing tomorrow as a part of the “Monthly Afternoon” magazine!
Yes 
Heads up that its only in Japan and america
I’m currently using a VPN and it works, but the VPN is paid…
I honestly can't be bothered with vpns but Im dying to read this so I'll try something to get it working
you can try ProtonVPN, it has a free version and I never had any issues with it
Thanks!
Np! Just a heads up though, they only give access to 3 regions, including USA, but they don't let you choose when connecting, so you'll have to reconnect and disconnect until you get USA (shouldn't take you long).
Is it also on Mobile? Most of the time I read mangas is when I'm anywhere, where I should be socializing so...
Yep it is. . [. . [. . &#x200B;. . I set it up on my own phone and it works fine for me
well... problem is that on the free version, it doesn't let you pick which country you want, only the fastest connection. for me, i got a server in netherlands
try disconnecting and reconnecting several times, usually it works for me. they also have a "switch server" option but theres a cooldown
i do not recommend using free vpns ever. it is dangerous and you can easily lose access to very important things.. . remember that you're basically making everything that you do on the internet funnel through them, and they could easily track you that way. perhaps they might even see unencrypted login or payment information if you're not careful enough, meaning you could easily get hacked on all fronts.. . yes the communication with the vpn might be encrypted, but that only makes it so that your isp can't see what you're doing, and they have to decrypt the communication before it reaches its endpoint, which usually happens on their servers, which is super easy to log.. . and also, obviously, running a vpn requires money, so they need to get some sort of an income, which is, in most cases, provided by selling the information they gathered from you using their services.
You're right about free VPNs, but like, this is Proton, they're in Switzerland, they're here since years, and the whole point is that their focus has always been online privacy. . . . Most people I've seen who know their subject say that they're more reliable than paid VPNs you usually find sponsoring the videos of youtubers. .   . worst case scenario, they'll just see the shows I watch, I never activate them when I input passwords or stuff like that
Respect 
How the fuck I'm using a paid VPN and it doesn't work  . Maybe the website crashed idk
Which VPN are you using?
Mullvad VPN
I just did a bit of research and heard that although Mullvad is a cheap and speedy VPN, it isn’t the best option for unblocking regional content…
It works now, I think that the website crashed or something
Yay! 
Finally!!! 
As someone who lives in the US, I see this as a win
As a brit , Im incredibly disappointed.

Most of the opinions I've seen so far are from people that have played the game already. I'm more curious to hear firsthand about someone's first exposure to Omori being the manga and what they thought of it.
Same! I already played the game and I found the pacing to be way too fast, but that may be different for someone who never played the game.
It's mostly going to be that way honestly, especially so on this sub.
#THE ART IS AMAZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASAASA SAIXJSXJDJXJSJXJSJXSHXJJXSJZNCNSWKXKWKXJX
#THERE IS NO WORDS THAT EXPRESS HOW ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS IT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I feel like the manga kinda relies on people already knowing the original story, with how fast it moves so far.. . But let’s see if it slows down a bit in future chapters…!
No please keep the fast pace
SAQUENME DE LATINOAMÉRICA NO PUEDO LEERLO AHHHHH 

Espérate, ¿no se puede leer en LATAM?
Según lo que tengo entendido no, hay que usar vpn
¡¡¡¡¡PUÑETAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!. . . okay.
I definitely agree to some extent. I thought the manga would have a slower start than this. Any new fan of Omori who encounters the manga first would probably feel very confused and unsatisfied with this chapter, as it leaves a bunch of questions in the reader’s mind. However, I still like the chapter and hope it gets better in future chapters.
You’re not alone, I do think that’s a poor choice on a way to start everything.. . But let’s see how it continues going forward, at least, rather than judge the whole manga on one chapter.. . As it stands though, I’m not sure yet that the manga is an okay way to introduce people to the beautiful storytelling of the game, but maybe future chapters will course correct a bit…!
I’m wondering if maybe in time, the art will transform. It’s gorgeous, but I do 100% agree with your stance. I know in the Soul Eater manga, if you compare the first release with some later releases, the later release art is INSANE compared to the earlier art. Here’s to hoping the manga creator has a ton of fun and really gets in touch with themselves and the story!
The default design generally in Manga (with some exceptions) in male characters is androgynous.. . In Asia, androgynous design is considered a great divine beauty.
How do I read it ?
You read it by going on the K MANGA app or website! You need to either be in the US or use a VPN, though. Here is the link: 
I can’t get it waaa😭
NOOOOOOOOO 
Use a free vpn! Its easy!
You can use this website, I'm pretty sure you don't need VPN for it! . 
Bless you.
 i cant thank you enough <3 been looking for a scans that have this so i can read it in tachiyomi.
No problem! It's a pretty good website too! I made a post in relation to this website just in case, hope this is helpful (god I type a lot 😰)
It’s only the first chapter for me
The art is great but it feels strange to start the manga off in Faraway town first. One of the most common complaints you hear is that headspace feels like filler after the real world segments so I wonder how they'll handle it.
. . Found a Twitter thread who uploaded it, but it sucks I can't read it the normal way.
What twitter,
damn i cant wait for chapter 2
When might chapter 2 come out?
Next month, around the 24th of July! It’s a monthly release.
Man, I was thinking it would be like a week. Well, I understand these things take time. I’m excited for the next one!
1 step closer to my Omori anime…
HOW TF DO I READ THIS AS A EUROPEAN 😭
You can try using a VPN! Other people in this comment section say to try and use Proton VPN, which is free!
LET'S GO, WE ARE SO BACK
THEY ALL LOOK SO CUTE 
The pacing is way too fast, but the art is good. It’s also a bit odd to start the story in faraway town, but that’s just my opinion.
DEJAME ENTRAR A LA PÁGINA. . 
For anyone who is struggling with region block, Opera has an integred VPN that is free, you set it to be in America and works just fine. Both in mobile and pc
It’s so unfair that it’s only in America and Japan.
I don’t really like the art style. Everyone’s face looks weird and they look a little too skinny
Holy crap!
Is it a physical copy too?
Not yet, but they’ll probably release physical copies once enough chapters have been released online! 
Awesomee
How many chapters do you think will have to be released online before they release the physical copies? Because I think I might just buy the physical copies first without reading it online 
Not sure, but most mangas I’ve read had 5-10 chapters per volume, depending on the length of the chapter.
Oh, alright! Thanks 
Yw! 
Neato.
AHHHHHH YESSSS IM SO EXCITEDDD 
can someone post it on literally anywhere else?? it's not available in my region :(
. . omor mang > jjk
Monthly release sucks.
It must feel like a long time, but you also need to remember that good things take time! Omori (the game) took many years, but it turned out to be such a masterpiece! Just wait a little longer, okay? You’ve got this! 
Fuck it's monthly
Donde salió 
Where can i buy it?
It’s free on K MANGA’s app or website! Here is a link to the manga: . . Warning though: K MANGA is US only, so you’ll need a VPN to use it outside of the US.

Whens it coming international
WE WINNNNNNN
ofc its not available in my region ffs
Is it just a retelling of the game or is it new stuff?
So far, I can see that it is probably going to follow the plot-points of the original game for a bit, although switched up a little and abridged. Maybe that will change in future chapters.
WHEN WILL THERE BE MORE
Next month, same day! On July 24th!
Yippee
Where can we read it?!??
Well, because it's not available where i live and i am inconpetant with vpns. If someone finds alrernative methods i'd appreciate it 🙏

Not in europe ofc
Is there a physical version?
Not yet, but a physical version will probably release when there are enough chapters for a volume! Most mangas release a volume 5-10 chapters each, depending on the chapter length!. . The Japanese version releases a chapter in a physical magazine called “Monthly Afternoon”, along with chapters of other mangas, every month; but that doesn’t really count.
It isn't available in Europe \*sad version of İstiklal Marşı plays in the background\*
Wiat is this a real official thing??. . This post just appeared on my feed and ive only seen 2 playthroughs of this game (1 incomplete and 1 completed)
We're gonna get monthly chapters???
That’s right\~ 
Finnaly omori manga out, now I just need to read it. . (It's on my reading list with OPM manga, Bleach manga, DB, DBZ, DBS and Boruto two vortex as well as JJK, MHA and Chainsaw man, oh and One Piece, most of them I either forgot to read or didn't read them in a while)
YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!

I’ll try my best! 
I just finished reading it and omfg the feels be hitting.
Mhm! It’s so much more fast-paced than the original game. SPOILERS FOR THE MANGA: >!I also didn’t expect a distorted version of the Christmas memory to open us off. It was quite unsettling to see Mari like that in manga form…!<
Ah jesus christ that already hits so hard...  i'm gonna cry from this game another time ust by reading the manga.  Here we go again.
i really don't like the art but alas i have brainrot
What? I thought it was normal for most BL H-manga artists to be women
im not talking about her being a woman
Yeah I know she's a BL H-manga artist but like, nearly every new gen mangaka (particularly shoujo) is
the problem is that the characters in said bl h-manga are children.
Wait fr? I thought it was just her art style
unfortunately it's true. She made art of a young boy and an adult man, and iirc she did stuff with siblings too.
Then don't read the manga?
Okay but counterargument: More mori
If you hate her past so much just don't read the manga.
Why does it matter? Either way she doesnt get my money
I don't know, maybe because doing so aliments illegal manga distributors? And apart from that, I'm just genuinely curious why someone would want to read (but not pay) for something he/she doesn't like.
I like the manga, just not the person making it. Plus, i'm getting it from random omori fans on twitter. Unless you're telling me that a bunch of neurodivergent gay teens are paying for twitter blue, they earn nothing from me viewing their posts.
That's still no excuse: nobody cares if you like the manga vut bit the author / you don't like the manga but you want to read it / etc.... If you read the manga you should pay for it, whatever the reason you're reading is. If everyone started thinking like you and nobody bought they'd just stop producing it.
or DON'T search up some sort of app starting with "M" and ending in "IHON" and install an extension that is similar in name to AnimeWater but the opposite of that and search for the omori manga that way, because well tyat wpuld be illegal to do you know
Please DONT dm me chapter 4 of the Manga, I DEFINITELY DONT want to read it and I DEFINITELY have the money to pay for it without pirating
Brother, while I'm also on the pirate train, you 100% have enough money to buy it. . . It's like, 2 dollars. If you DONT have two dollars, go mow lawns for a dollar a yard. . . It's actually almost impossible to not have 2 dollars
Yeah, I actually do have the money, I just don't want to spend it on that, even if it's just two dollars.
PLEASE don’t DM me the manga, I’ll just wait until I can access it through TOTALLY legal means.
It'd be absolutely terrible if you decided to DM me, please do NOT send me the manga pages
Hey please do not dm and do not send free omori chapter 4 manga pages
Hey please don't dm me the manga ☺️
It's just fair, why should an author spend hours drawing a manga without being paid?
These comments are idiotic. Obviously it's not gonna be free forever. If you are enjoying the manga at all, and you want it to continue, you should purchase the new chapters to support the mangaka and keep the series going. If no one buys, the manga will just be cancelled. . . . This isn't being produced by a large media conglomerate. It's being produced by one mangaka and an editor or two. Piracy of an indie creator's work is wrong.
Now, if they didn't landlock it to \*only japan and USA\*...
So true. Like somebody said it's 2$, that's not expensive or anything. Please support the creator.
Finally some common sense. I never saw anybody complaining that comics aren't free in bookshops, it's just normal to pay for something. You should just be thankful because the first chapters were free.
i'm surprised ppl are surprised by this, i thought the general consensus was that a few of the chapters would be free to read, idk who but i remember hearing that info from someone (maybe from twitter) since i've never used kmanga til now. it also seems like kmanga does this with other manga as well, not just with omori. . i'm only really interested in the "receive a special illustration" raffle thing that's going on with chpt 4 rn, but besides that i dont really see myself paying for the rest :<c
It's just normal it ain't gonna be free forever, lol
ye, exactly
I would be ok with paying for this if they didn't use such a draconian app. Why I can't pay with money (like iTunes)? Instead you must use "coins"???? and I've heard this monetization model is absolutely predatory. Worst of all, the app is ONLY FOR THE US... Louis Rossmann should do a video on K-Manga. Luckily I found an alternative way to see the omori manga
It sure would be a tragedy if someone's DMs weren't open and they weren't ready to share the manga with anyone asking, truly. -wink-
I really hope you definitely do not send them to my DMs after I definitely didn't request as such.
Oh please don't DM me the chapter,that would be a b s o l u t e l y not fair and really mean!
Yeah, no, sorry. The three first chapters showed us that the manga is a hot mess and i'm tbh not interested to read it for free anymore. You can't just throw any cheaply made content into the fanbase and expect people to buy it cuz it has familiar charecters in it. Shame. This had the potential to be absolute peak
Ngl, I didn't have high expectations for a manga about OMORI of all games. There was no need for one whatsoever.
Is this an official manga?
Yes, it is.
i love the manga idk what yall on (im poor please give ch4😿)
You guys don't know mangadex?
Personally I’d buy the whole manga as a yk book?? Like I thought it would be , I’ll wait for it to be fully complete as a book then reading online
guys, is this manga worth reading? I stopped consuming omori media a while ago, I would like to know if it is good
it isn't
Ok…so…I mean we pay for books and manga online too…idk what is the big deal…
I don't know either, people learning that comics are not free
I mean I been paying for comics since I was six and I know they are not free. I think those three chapters being free was probably like a trail thing or something for people that can’t pay to see if they want to pay for more or not
Just when I thought the Omori manga discourse couldn’t get any worse 💀 And for the people saying that it’s not that bad, may I remind you that this is Japanese and American exclusive (for some reason. I tried looking up why and couldn’t find anything. If someone knows, please do tell. I understand Nintendo for instance having Japanese exclusive merchandise, but isn’t this digital? It can’t be that hard to adapt to other countries. Isn’t the whole point of… y’know… making something digital… as in online… to make it more accessible……)
Okay, so from what I’m seeing here, the lack of accessibility has to do with the app (maybe). Which is still a bad choice on the creators’ behalf. Why would use a platform for your manga only available to TWO countries? Surely, they would have checked their policies before doing this. That was a conscious decision. I’m not upset about this because I want to read it, or that I can’t access it, but I’m upset for people who do want to read it and can’t. And I get Omocat’s whole business thing, and I really want to respect this, but this honestly seems like a cash grab…
A manga that isn't free??? This is the first time I see something like that?????
I'm sure people would buy the manga if it was actually good and wasn't just the 20x sped up plot of the game. If there's a fandom where people love merch, it's here. Just think of how quickly the plushies sell out. People just don't wanna pay for slop
I don't really care if people just choose not to read it, but so many people are pirating it with the excuse of "oh it's bad." But the manga being subjectively bad doesn't really make it morally correct to pirate from an indie creator, especially one that those same people claim to be a "fan" of.
They pirate the manga because the manga isn't up to quality. . I pirate the manga because I don't like omocat. . We're not the same 
I pirate the manga because i'm not in the us and i'm broke
Both of them are crappy reasons.
Do NOT upload full manga chapters here. It is a violation of copyright and violates Reddit's TOS. You are free to send it in dms.
Wait, are people still reading the manga, I thought everyone hated it
No, they hate it but still want to read it without paying, lol
Meanwhile, the game still isn’t even out yet in Europe 2 years later digitally, physicals were cancelled, but at least you get to pay for the manga now (but only in some regions cause even the manga is regionlocked)!
Official manga.
Where i can read these manga?
That's not unusual for manga services I think. It's probably the same for everyone, even the JP audience.. . I've been so spoiled with Manga+ that lets you read the 3 newest chapters for free, and Webtoon, which has the chapters available first behind a paywall and free afterwards.. . Well, my experience here won't change as they don't release their apps outside of US anyway.
Please, Please don't DM me the Manga! I plan on paying for it and not pirating it.
Please, Please DM me the Manga! I plan on pirating it and not paying for it.

Fr. I bought the gay flower boi so I think that covers all the purchases 
A friend of mines flowerboy got lost in shipping lil bro got sent to blackspace 🫡
. . Bro’s in a better place now
I'm not Paying Each Chapter of a Mid ass Manga that i keep reading in hopes it will be better Seperatly.
If it's a "Mid ass Manga," then just don't read it. You're not above morals because you don't like the material, you're still engaging with the creator's work and not paying them for it.
how dare someone have any hope that something related to something they love will get better
If you don't like it, then just don't associate. There's plenty of other ways to interact with Omori and it's community.
Also is that fucking HOLLOW KNIGHT?!
then wait for it to become free once the raffle thing ends, if i read the poster right. i understand being disappointed something isn't free, but we don't have to whine about it.
Well that explains one of the reasons i dont like the manga
Because it's not free? There are plenty of mangas that aren't free, but people in this comment section seem they have forgotten it.
One of the reasons
Honest question, why are comics colored but mangas aren't? To make them more affordable?
And also because manga often have such strict deadlines (especially weekly manga) that they don’t have time for color
The magazines they are first published in usually use recycled paper because nobody keeps those (except non Japanese people). So, it is more profitable to make it as cheap as possible because it's extremely big and people won't read all of it either. There are still some between 2-5 pages high quality paper that is used for color prints like some merchandize show offs or for one of the most popular manga of the magazine. Plus, the author don't have time to color them afterwards because like you said, they have a quick pace of production each week.
...do japanese people buy the same manga twice?
Magazines like the Jump are supposed to be trashed away. Think about it as a journal with all of the new chapters of the week from different mangas but in poor quality recycled paper. It's in that kind of magazines mangas are first published in. They are other magazines that are published once a month but it works the same. If they love the manga, they will buy the manga so no, they don't buy the same manga twice.
They can buy a tankobon volume which is basically an entire publishing season of a manga in one book.
It's an entirely different system. . . In manga you have a main artist who does the main, inked art with potentially (but often not) some assistants doing grunt work. The traditional way of doing shading in Japanese manga is with small pieces of tape that you cut out and glue to the page. This is then submitted to the publisher. So you have basically a small workshop process.. . Major comics are a production line process with a minimum of three people. One does the pencils, another goes over the lines and inks them, a third does the colouring. This is the only way to create acceptable coloured art at the pace required.
well it's cheaper to produce. . and it's also easier on the mangakas since most mangakas are already used to "color" with black and white (as in imply color without color) where as most western comic artists never really learned that. . and it's tradition fot manga to be black and white
I did it in 1 minute in photoshop, it cant be THAT hard.. It is still a pain n the ass to do it with whole manga, yes it can cause delays, but it can be filtered after the chapter came out, like it would be max several hours for the 1 chapter, you can just hire someone to do the filtering. . Considering how much effort was putted in the original game filtering manga to purple excluding omori is not a big deal, but it can greatly improve it. RW can be black and white.
no it's because you don't understand how manga production works.
If we are talking about only a digitalized version, made only and only for the Internet, that is fine, who knows, it even looks pretty.. .  But if we talk about printed manga, a disaster would be generated at the distribution level and the economic resources would be exhausted very quickly to sustain stable production.
the reason why manga is traditionally black and white is because it's easier and faster to work on and produce. . working with two colors is already more work
Same reason books with only words don’t have colored letters. Black is the cheapest ink to produce. And manga is specifically a style of comic that does black and white for that reason. It would have to be a webcomic or something to have color like that, or be much more expensive.. . Think about the paper they put in most books. And then think about the paper in colored comics. That’s not the same paper right? The paper that books/manga use costs less then the paper colored books use. That would also drive up the cost. With how much ink and higher quality paper they’d need, it wouldn’t be worth it to make.
Mangakas already work on their manga under stress, asking them to add colors to their work is adding even more ton of work, reducing their life expectancy.. . . . There are already mangakas taking breaks, and others have passed away (Akira, Miura).
>There are already mangakas taking breaks. . The hunter x hunter fan experience lol. But yeah I I think a lot of the people here just don't read manga or understand the process of making manga. Besides mangaka already have tight deadlines. Ading more work ontop of that is insane! As a side note what mangaka need are better work hours and scheduling. I feel like the manga industry would be in a better place if they were Bi-weekly as opposed to weekly.
Honestly as much better as it looks in the manga version the color scheme doesn't look so important i mean the dreamworld in the game looked like drawn kinda with pastels and cuts of paper
This is like the 5th time someone suggests this, and headspace being in manga style isn't even that bad, y'all are just picky
If you're actually printing the manga, then yes. *Especially* if the plan is to leave Omori in black and white. At that point you basically have to move to a full-color printing process.
Baby's first manga
Manga is a completely different medium and has its own rules, traditions, methods etc. Changing all that just because it doesn't fit the vibe of Omori is not cool in my opinion.. . Also you're upset about people dragging you about this opinion but you're literally the one judging the people who work on the manga. "Is it really that hard..." is full of criticism. I think you could've avoided all those down votes if you adjusted your language just a bit /pos
It wouldn’t be a good choice because if costs, and Manga are traditionally just black and white.
A lot of people worried about costs in here, but if Webtoon can put out full colored physical copies then Omori could have too if they wanted to. They just chose the wrong medium, color matters in Omori, but manga are traditionally black and white. Should have just done a webtoon adaptation and then made physical copies of that when they were done.
a single volume from a webtoon series is double the price of a manga volume, its cheaper for omocat and consumers for them to go with manga, thats probably why they did
Guys what websites can you read the manga (i can't use k mamga because it's banned in my countrie,. Btw if anyone tries to sponser nord vpn i swear to god)
i used windscribe 
Nah i can't pay for a subscription for a vpn. Thx anyway
It is free, try browsec and windscribe
FR, I've been saying this ever since the manga was announced.

Better than the face he was actually making tbh
Nooo he was so cute
The face just looked… strange. Like he wanted something
They did this so that people knew he was a guy
All of the 12 year olds in the fandom are using all of their slang in these comments. It's funny
Many jojo fan are adults, I thinks it's a little reducting to say that all of them are children because of that.
I don't think anyone commented a single JoJo reference when I commented that. If they have since then that's not what I'm referring to.. . Edit: I just checked again and I've seen one thing that's maybe a JoJo reference? I don't know why you assumed I was talking about that one comment and none of the other 43 on this post
Ah sorry, I thought it was about that specific post my bad if you have taken badly.
It's fine it just seemed kinda random
Yeah sorry for that I am just kinda tired to see so many kids in M rated games, nothing to do with you.
Babil
how do i find the omori manga?
Search up K Manga and im pretty sure you can get it there. Although some countries don't let you access it (like mine) so I wouldn't know if it cost money or whatever but I think it's free
Huh
Turned into jjba
mf thinks he's Frank West lol
NOOOOOOOO
His name is Skyler White, yo
Is that a Jojo reference. . 
Cool shot.
It’s funny

what did bro even say 💀
Nuh uh
What they say?
That the manga was the worst thing to come out.
Oh
He's bending forwards a little but yeah ig she's just tall in the manga
why the hell did they make polly so fine in the manga-
SHe’s always been fine wdym
It’s a manga that’s why
I assume they're just exaggerating the height difference between adults and children for the sake of the story, I've seen it in other stuff like Evangelion
A'ight, I'mma give the manga a try and it's purely because of Polly

I would've fallen for it too if you hadn't said that 😭
Okay, but where do I watch the manga for free 😭 (I'm european)
The manga looks nice
im convinced omocat just threw cash at some rando and didnt bother to quality control the manga nor the character of the mangaka xd
I was reading the comments and i dont understand something. Why people hate this manga, i just read it and i found it really cool
I kinda agree, but as time goes on I'm slowly accepting the manga. Omori the game still exists, so if there is going to be releasing an adaptation it feels like a waste not to make some changes to it so the manga is it's own unique thing, otherwise why even bother making it if you can play the game?
I wouldn't say it would be a waste. I think some people expected it to be like how anime adapts the source material of manga mostly faithfully. Some people just won't read manga for reasons like the lack of voice actors, sfx/music, and colors for example. Also, the game is pretty lengthy and some people played it more for the story rather than its gameplay. . . This ultimately reminds me of the Ship of Theseus. At what point would it have been better to not be tied to the Omori's name with its changes? I think the manga is fine currently but would not suggest this as a substitute for the game in the slightest. The manga adaptation having extra/different details is interesting though.
its the official manga, this scene's from ch 3
I know it’s the official manga, I was hoping for a direct link to the chapter
. . It’s only available in the US, so you’ll need VPN if you don’t live there.
Yk if they don't want us to pirate Mangas so badly why region lock them
Can't seem to find the official manga, may I have the link please?
. . It’s only available in the US, so you’ll need VPN if you don’t live there.
Where do I find the Mangas?
okay thanks :D
wait are there not physical copies ?
Not yet considering there aren’t that many chapters as of now.
The Omori manga doesn’t have it’s own book, but in japan, it’s in the kodosha’s monthly afternoon magazine
I’ve been downvoted, guess my official leaked manga panel from chapter 18 isn’t good enough.
Chapter 18 is coming in a year and 3 months yay
Can you check how the other mangas in that app are? If they have similar paywalls after the third chapter, then I fear there's no hope.
. . It looks induvidual
That one looks wild, two "chapters" released per month but they're actually different halves of one.. . But thanks, based on this and how I've seen other manga apps behave I believe we won't be getting more freebies 
179 chapters with the actual pacing? The mangaka will run out of source material with 1/4 of that
Kmanga app. But the manga may be region locked
Omg thank you! You are a life saver!!!
Kmanga app, but the manga might be region locked
Thanks!
If the manga ends like that I would literally cry ONG
In the manga both of them are ten times more fruitier and it's just chapter 1
Fr omg 😭😭
It is a somewhat common look in the most current mangas.. . You don't know if he's eating with his eyes or just saying hello 
Where can you read the manga?
You can read the first chapter in English on K manga (an app)

This is from the fifth chapter of the Omori manga on K MANGA!
omori manga is so weird compared to the game events' chronology but I still like it. I mean there are spoilers for the game in first chapter of manga already
OMORI HAS A MANGA???
meh i still prefer how he looks in the game. everybody has the same face in the manga
Reading through Twitter and some of these reddit comments I feel like I'm the only person who likes the artstyle or even the manga (so far) as a whole 😭 . . I love the expressiveness and even though the artstyle does make them look younger, it's a different look and overall a different take on Omori which I feel is always welcome
i love it. there are a few things that disappoint me (like the big twist of the game being talked about in the first few pages) but they could be setting up for something different. i dont know if they are keeping the same narrative or not so im not making a bunch of impressions when i dont know much. . . the artstyle is great imo because it is very cute which works really well in building the creepy and unsettling points. we all kinda got numbed to it, but headspace is supposed to be this wonderful and cute world that contrasts with reality and blackspace and the such. i think this art style is going to be really good in getting those contrasting moments, hell we already got a few of them. . . the only real problem i would have with the art style is the fact that omori really doesnt stick out in headspace
You've pretty much summed up how I feel! I think the manga, if handled correctly (I have faith in Nui and OMOCAT) can be great. I've got high hooes for the manga and I hope it doesn't disappoint
I think omori sticks out a lot. You can tell which one's him because he never has any emotions on his face. . . . (aside from this)
I feel the exact same way !!
where can you buy a physical copy of the manga?
Japan
omori manga is now officially ruined . . (wait, they’re doing the rain flashback now????? did we make it to the recital area in like, 7 chapters???)
I haven't been keeping up with the manga, but from my understanding they kinda just skip most of Headspace 
Then again, if the manga is mostly 90% headspace, It  gets boring quite fast. so it's kind of hard to find a balance
They're introducing all the Memory Lane scenes early. We had the Christmas memory at the very beginning of chapter 1, so I'm guessing they opted to intersperse them throughout the story.
Watch this manga pull an Scott pilgrim takes off, I tell ya I can feel it, it's luring you guys in
Wait didn’t the manga come out like 4 months ago or something? How are we already at the childhood Faraway Flashbacks?
Worst manga adaptation ever tbh /j
wait i dont understand. what did she say in-game :0. . also is this manga official? or like some-one else is making them
Wait what was the original line I didn’t see the original manga-
Polly being short is something I never thought about, but seeing it here, it's just adorable. 😊
There goes my tall POLLY headcannon 😔
Wait, Polly is THIS short!? Daymn...
SHORTER???? I THOUGHT SHE WAS KINDA TALL 
r/handholding
MaRk ThIs As A sPoIlEr PlEaSe. Seriously tho… who the fuck is Polly?
I didnt realize she was that short lol
why is she so small and looks like a child nahhh😭😭😭
Bros never seen a short woman before
Will the manga get a physical version in the future ??
where tf are you guys reading this new omori manga
K Manga, there’s a Website and App
K manga is not accessible in my country idk where i can read it ;-;
Its a manga. She's literally a character in the medium that most anime are before they become anime
True - it doesn’t excuse her for being a biG FUCKING DORK THOUGH. . 
But she IS a fucking dork in the original game.. . "How many years have passed since you left your house? Three? Maybe four? It must have been nice to live inside your own bubble"

Can't wait for her dream to come true in 2058 
She thinks she's in a manga
It’s funny how you say that because it looks like she’s getting the “shadow the hedgehog” treatment so far in the manga though lmao
I mean, we went from game to manga, so next is anime.. . She’s just getting ready to become an anime girl!
i want the manga wgehrhrj
the cringy dialouge is another reason i do not like the manga 😔
you can blame the kmanga translators for that honestly
Wouldn't the original language be English?
as far as im aware the japanese version is the original (thats usually how manga generally goes anyway) but fact check me all you want on that
Um. Not to be that guy, but it’s a manga, not a comic. They are different.
. . ✿ In other news, I just searched up alligator recipes and this popped up. *never thought I’d say Alligator chicken nuggets look delicious but here I am.* \~ :\]
idk why im looking at this while holding my alligator plush

Dude, gator is SO good. I had a gator Po'boy in New Orleans at some dive bar and it was one of the finest cuisines I'd ever enjoyed in my life.
Wait, that’s a thing?! 😨
I think it’s safe to say that instead of a 1-1 recreation of omori it’s more of a retelling. >! Also DAMN OMORI “gator guy begs him to stop then goes silent” is actually haunting, makes me realize that omori isn’t using a pan, or throwing balls at people, or hitting people with stuffed animals, he’s actually stabbing them with a kitchen knife.!<
Damn. I always interpreted the stabbings in HS in a cartoony, Zelda-like fashion. This is actually a good way to change the Headspace segments into something grittier without just tossing in Black Space monsters.
It always seemed to me that his attacks were more brutal than the rest of the kids.
Self defense? Bro was just standing there
Nah, >!Gator Guy legit pulled out a gun on a child!<. . Edit: that was the self defense. My bad.
I sorta wanted this in the game.. . That by the end, the sad parts of reality and Sunny's personality really started to leak onto Headspace in the final areas, until it became unbeareably obvious that the place wasn't going to endure a lot.. . It would have probably required to make the game a single route tho'. . . I never expected to be complimenting the Omori manga but here we are.
what in this In Stars and Time has the manga turned into. . I really need to read up on it
(Just Attack)
It make sense with the end of the game. I dont think he is out of character here
thats my goat 🔥
He heard phonk in the background so he had to farm some aura
bro you already know you've fucked up when your own imagination is against the thing youd o🙏🙏🥀🥀
Wait ... This is a new chapter???
Jeez bro! Defeating a GatorGuy in game isn't that aggressive!
We need foreshadowing for what happens later
Spoiler your post, man..
I dont have access to manga, in what context he attacked him? Its not exactly like in game for sure
He stab him
This seen gives me In Stars And Time vibes specifically to THAT one seen.
28 stab wounds!
Oh, gosh. That’s gruesome. Haven’t read the new chapter yet, don’t remember Omori going into that frenzy in the game 😭 Looks interesting can’t wait to read it ;)
Omori wilding
. . more handwriting examples :)
ITS SO CUTE😭😭
Hold on where is this from??
Wait nvm ofc its from the bday image :D

"the content is not available in your country"
Vpn is available in every country
K-Manga is weird with VPNs, sometimes they work sometimes they don’t..
Maybe for some regions, I live in south east Asia everything is fine with the VPN
Glad to hear that, I use a VPN just in daily life just because and sometimes I have to turn it off to use the app while other times I don’t
I think its also on Mangadex, at least I read it there.
Ditto.
use windscribe!!! works so good!!!
I’m not enjoying it so far. I think it might be missing the point? This story was made for the medium of video games and it’s having a hard time with the transition. I don’t like the altered order of events, I don’t like how they completely removed key parts of the gameplay that are actually really relevant (like the emotions), I don’t like how they’re treating the characters, and I despise the lightning-fast pacing. I’m worried about the rest of the story, the set-up already feels botched to me.
The only thing I'm disappointed about is that they completely deleted the emotions system which I always wondered how it would look like in manga and the ultimate attack and follow-up attacks in the boss fight against ye old sprout ||tho maybe they will show it in the space bf fight|| overall the pacing yes it's very different from the game everything is too fast but it's okay imo
tbh we haven't seen enough of headspace yet, there's still time for the emotion system to factor in. Probably will just be a minor role or nod though. Like you said, probably on the bosses.
We've only seen one headspace fight so far tho, emotions could still easily make it in
Honestly, it makes sense that it's not here. That's a purely game mechanic thing that will not work for a comic. I would like to see references to status effects on the HS characters, but having a moment where Hero literally explains how it works in the manga will not work well.
See because it's a game mechanic I always wanted to see how they would recreate it even in their own way and maybe not fully like in the game but sadly they didn't show it, maybe they will In Later chapters
Yeah I would like to see some of the style effects that the emotion statuses from the game as like an emotion thing (kinda like how you see an anime character with the raise blood vessel in the face if they're pissed) but I have no idea if that'll happen.
Gotta hope
I wasn't trying to do censoring, I just don't like the '()' so I use '|| ||' thanks tho I didn't know
most divided comment section I’ve ever seen
That's what I'm saying! 🤣
It's the first time they've seen a manga, the accusations they're throwing at the mangaka.... There are puritans in witch hunt mode
What accusations?
I don't like it personally in my opinion, but I don't hate it I'm grateful for it but I just don't really feel like it's good in my opinion it could be the pacing or something that just drew my dislike over it, but I don't mind, it was just a bit of a rush tbh. 6/10 for me personally.
Overall, I love it! Even despite the concerns I have with it. . . Having RW be after HS is a bit of an odd choice and it caught me off guard, but I’m a bit curious as to how they run with the change. . . Pacing is a bit wack, but they seemed to have calmed things down a bit with the 2nd chapter. I hope that keeps up as chapters release. . . I honestly don’t know how to feel about the art style. On one hand, I kinda like it and it looks beautiful, on the other hand, our cast is drawn strangely. Especially Basil in some panels. . . Despite all this though, I’m still willing to follow through with the manga till the end. I’m just too excited to see how future fights are adapted. Especially a *certain* fight near the end.
I don’t like the art style at all.
I wished the art style was the same as Omori's original comic
Yeah, the artstyle really weirds me out. I don't know how to explain it, but it looks like the kind of artstyle you'd see in a yaoi manga
Well it’s because the artist…
Wait till you find out what the artist's other works are.
Fr like I love that they kind of adapted the story to fit the style of a manga and I don't believe, like most do, that the characters act out of character, I think we just saw too little of them, the only complain I have is just the way the mangaka draws kids... he not like us.
Gave me chills when Sunny says “It’s Omorin’ time” then Omoris all over the place. Truly one of the mangas ever made
Overall I think it's great, but I do thing the pacing is the weakest point of manga, I feel like Chapter 1 alone can be separated into 3, Chapter 2 is slightly better in terms of pacing, but overall I still think the pacing is better in the original game. . Other than that, I think it's awesome, I absolutely love the art style, I think they nailed it with the expression, and honestly I like that we're transitioning from RW to HS in the beginning, cause let's be real, most people reading this already played the game, and honestly I don't want something that's like exactly the same as the game, so I think it's interesting they decided to do that
this is literally the only reason i dont liek the manga, shit is impossible to ignore while reading
And I find that deeply sad! Omori is fantastic game which offers a unique and emotional experience. I feel that this manga diminishes the game with it’s creepiness.
I don't care what the community says, I am loving it so far. Although yeah, the pacing is not great
Its ok . But play the game first becuase this story is too good to get spoiled from the worse manga. Otherwise its just ok
Gay (i never read the manga)
Literally what I was gonna say lol, that artstyle is... Uh fruity to say the least
happy cake day
1st chapter sucked, 2nd was an improvement
I believe it has one major problem: the author has put too much of his own "touch" in it, making it pretty distant to the original art style.. Also, some characters are written in a *cough* particular way that may have some *cough* shady reasons, let's just say
everything surrounding it is a disaster and it almost feels impossible to ignore the kind of person the artist is while reading
Separate the art from the artist, just read the manga normally and focus on the art and storyline instead of who made it...
It's crazy to me that you get downvoted for saying the most normal thing ever here
I'm not upset im just saying to seperate the art from the artist, i just feel like its unnecessary to make the fact that the artist is a bad person such an important factor in the manga, i'm not upset or angry at you for feeling weird that the mangaka's a sh\*tacon, i was just saying.
except not everyone can or wants to seperate art from the artist. people are going to talk about it because its important and it seriously affects a lot of people's ability to enjoy the manga. if you can still enjoy it that's awesome and im glad. but asking people to not bring up the mangaka's inappropriateness when talking about the manga is like asking people to not talk about JK rowling's transphobia when harry potter is brought up.
Look, if you can't seperate the art from the artist i'm completely fine with that. again, I was just saying.
then why comment about it?
Am i not allowed to give my opinion on your take?
my take that i found it hard to read because of its background? cauae that's not a take that's my experience reading it. or my take that everything surrounding it is a distaster?
What's the difference if it's your experience? It's still just my opinion and i don't think you should be taking it so seriously
. your opinion being that everyone should just separate art from the artist? because yeah you're allowed to say that but im allowed to say that i think you're wrong and that it's weird to try to tell people how they should feel reading something. it's not that serious, no, but when you argue someone they tend to argue back brah
I wasn't trying to tell people how they should feel, i was just saying that in my opinion it's better to separate the art from the artist, not that everyone must and have to separate, it's just a suggestion ofcourse. and look, if you can't enjoy the manga cause of the mangaka then i'm literally okay with that, i'm not trying to change the way you experience the manga if that's what you think.
then you responded to the wrong person because i never said nor implied that seperating art from artist is impossible or wrong
...when did i ever say that you implied that it was wrong or impossible? That doesn't have to do with anything i actually said.
The art style is so amazing i couldnt focus that much on the story ngl
It's very mixed. The art can be good at times, but the creepy undertones that I cannot mention without getting this comment removed by mods really hamper the experience.. . The pacing is also really weird. I've seen people say "you just don't like that it's told in a different order", and yeah, there's that, but it's also just going through the story at a really weird pace, and it feels unnatural.. . Omori is a story meant to be told as a game. Sunny's development is made much better if you have control over him and make him experience Faraway in a way that builds on his eventual growth. The whole "silent protagonist" thing also really fits the game to show how awkward and weird the dude is lol.. . Ultimately, I wouldn't blame people for liking it, Omori is fundamentally a good story after all, but the manga really isn't my cup of tea.
I dont like it. 
Had so much potential but failed
It's peak.. . And tbh I don't get most of the criticism, especially about the pacing but that might just be me.
pacing criticisms almost never make any sense to me. Like what do you expect? They're gonna show the group doing 18 battles in headspace like one does in the Vast Forest section of the game? They're gonna go around and inspect every little object? This is not a video game, it makes no sense to try to recreate the experience of a video game in a manga.. you wanna slow the pacing down? Stop reading it so quickly, maybe?
I’m just gonna treat it like secondary canon.
I've read two chapters idk how many are out but that's all that's available atm and I have no clue whats happening (I haven't played the visual novel or read whatever the original source was)
I would definitely reccomend playing the game, the story is told in a much better order and paced much more organically and plus everyone actually looks their age
There's a manga?
I like it personally I know a lot of people don’t like how real world came before headspace but I personally don’t mind and the art style is really pretty and i just really like it
I think it’s okay. The pacing is a bit fast and I’m not a big fan of the art style. It almost looks sexual if you catch my drift; these are kids, no need for them to be drawn so suggestively
People in the comments saying that the kids are drawn suggestively… what are y’all talking about 😭 That’s on YOU
It's good. But game one is better. I think manga is rushing story so much. And pretty much making basil look like more femboy. I don't like it though. I hope they didn't change to much things form the game to the Manga.
It’s good
i think it's fine, i just wanna read some omori manga
Dawg I can’t even read it
Has a lot of potenial but the it is way too fast faced. 
havent read it
It should be there for the new people and for exploring a new visual medium, unfortunately it’s horribly confusing for new people and visually unappealing
I love it. It’s not perfect but it’s still incredible
Where?!
The design is good but the story structure and pacing arent great
Wow, a post about Omori's manga where the comments are not locked
most criticisms i’ve seen were pretty fair but it’s honestly promising, i would say my biggest criticism but 1. its already been said a bajillion times before and 2. i’m afraid i’ll get smited by the mods
Its not a favorite. Im my opinion, the pacing feels too fast and all over, along with the order of events. I also thought it would be the same as the game, but oh well. After the fnaf movie, Ive learned to just keep my mouth shut
I think it’s great!
the pacing SUCKS, this wouldve been the easiest adaptation ever.
I genuinely like it, if I'm going to criticize something I'm going to criticize the manga, not the mangaka, but getting to the point, there are some things that were omitted for now, like the emotion system, etc., it would seem as if it were between "adapting from in some way the mechanics only-gameplay to the manga" or "discarding it" in all possible cases they took the second option. I like the artistic style, although that is relative to each one, but for me the only thing that sins for now the manga It's about the speed of events/pacing, everything feels very rushed, cutting sections everywhere as if it were a summary, the "prologue" lasted one chapter, barely two, I hope "3/2/1 days left" can be addressed better, and that the "prologue" has been rushed just because it is the prologue.. .  For now I give it a 7.5/10 for now, it can vary a lot, only two editions came out.
i wish the pacing was more like the game but i can understand the limitations due to the completely different format. i think the art style is really cute. overall i'm enjoying it so far and im excited to see how it progresses
I think the pacing is wacky, and I don't like Mari's hair. Beyond that, I am interested to see how the manga works as a full story, as I think it's too early to judge the quality of the manga.
I like it, the art is cool and it’s an interesting way to make it into a manga. BUT, i do find the story going a bit fast. Like, everything is just coming at you and it’s a bit overwhelming. In my opinion though lol!
The art style reminds me too much of Evangelion. Artist should have more closely followed the styles used for the game.
I'll definitely be reading it but I don't really like the artstyle. I want their round heads back😭. . Also the fact they all look about 4 years younger than they should is a bit offputting but at the end of the day omori is omori so ima be reading ALL of it
racism.
It really sucks.
I love the art, it’s beautiful, but OH MY GOD SLOW THIS SHIT DOWN, at this rate we’ll go from Pinwheel Forest to One Day Left in 2 panels
I haven't read it yet :/ where can i read it??
You can read it on an app called KManga. Very random place to release 🥲
Conflicted. I think the art is very pretty, but not quite what I had in mind. The story beats feel a bit rushed. . The main thing for me is that don’t want this to be the introduction people have to the game.
It's Baaad,like really,really bad.
cool more cool than cool
Omor
I like it but there are a few things I dislike
i dont really think OMORI is all that translatable to manga. that said some of the uhh, "less artistically inclined" complaints people have for the manga are pretty ridiculous i think. acting like drawing something of a certain explicitness bars someone from drawing something less explicit is a disappointingly anti-artist sentiment from an indie game fanbase, especially given OMORI's origins(and content, tbh)
I dont really know sorry cuz im in Singapore😅 I mean if you get it the same way you got the first picture it shoukd work in theory? It shoukd apply for all manga's that are first edition
I don't have any yet lol. I'm just nervous that I won't get it at all cuz some people have said the pictures are getting more rare as time passes, and the preorder won't actually come until around late march
yes. . 
How cool! 😭
. . I am so done with you bruv...
The Omori manga volume 2 didn't even come out yet where I live :(
Please where did you get this? I'll give you my life span, please tell me
I bought it at my manga bookstore lol
Personally, I think the police in America have other things to worry about than anyone pirating this manga... but what do I know?
Mhm! I’m pretty sure the pacing issues in the first chapter were just to hook people in. The rest of the manga would probably be a lot more like this one!
I THINK I POSTED IT LESS THAN 20 SECONDS AFTER IT CAME OUT LOL. . I was practicing the whole hour before, and was planning on taking a pic from the manga itself…but then got a screenshot warning that threatened to suspend me for it haha 
oof-
>>!Although I do have the same issues everyone else has with the Omori manga, I do think there is currently ONE thing the manga does better than the game IMO: Aubrey. In the game, she's just a bully who puts on a fearful act. Which is fine. But in the manga, she's basically a monster who actually uses her bat. I also like how she seems to want to bully Sunny the way she does Basil too, which actually makes a lot of sense since to her, Sunny abandoned her too. I can't wait for the church and the lake scenes!!<. . >!About Aubrey being a little more violent, I personally prefer her being more of a bully putting on a fearful act, to highlight how she hasn't really moved on from the gang, despite her claims.  It also makes her seem less callous and unlikable as well (some people argue her redemption later on was rushed, I think so a little but overall was fine to me)!<
People have translated the Beastars manga, and they put it up on Mangadex.
actually you can,just that you have to use other websites to do so and not k manga
Mhm! Sharleen was picking daisies with Daisy, Van was playing tetherball with Berly, and Shawn was chasing Ren! Happy, Brows, and Bangs were there too. Unfortunately, I don’t think I saw Neb or Mikal.. . I would like to insert a screenshot of them here, but I’m afraid of getting permanently suspended by K MANGA…
nvm i saw it and i have only one reaction……HELL YEAAAAAAAAAA🗣️🗣️‼️‼️🔥🔥🔥🦅🦅🦅🦅
Wait a second, there is an omori Manga? I just finished watching the game a few days ago, so I didn't know since I'm new to the community. Link plz?
Here you go! . . [
Is the site down? It gives me error 403 request blocked. . Edit: oh, the website isn't available in my country
It’s on K MANGA ([), but only people in the US or using a VPN can access it…. . People may upload the manga to other sites or send files of it to each other to read, but it isn’t exactly a legal method. 
Thank you so much 
On the K MANGA website! But it is only for US and people using VPNs, so you’ll need a workaround if you’re not.. . 
The pacing was really fast, I guess this manga is going to have a small number of chapters, maybe like around 10 or so. I don't mind if the event order are a little different and after all I liked the chapter.. Btw when they showed the game damage counter I thought we would have seen more about the game system(like the emotions systems, the full energy special attack, the fight with the Old Sprout etc)
Y'all are forgetting 12 year old is young af
they look very similar when they are 16
They do ?
But They are adorable 
I mean, they are 12 in headspace. To me, they look like 12 year olds.
I think it's probably the artist wanting to make HS as cute and happy and innocent as possible in the beginning like the game
FOR REAL, like I wanna buy the manga but uhh the art style really made them look younger asf
when the child character is a child
really throws me off too. was kinda excited for the manga, but all the mess around the mangaka just make me uncomfortable. like, the art style is just weird, making 16 year olds look like 10 year olds, and knowing the background of the artist, yeah no thanks. . still, i don't think it's inappropriate to enjoy it, if you aren't weirded out by this, good for you, i don't really see the issue
What do you think the main cast would look like if they were younger by 4 years?
Literal infants lol
its the artists type. iykyk
I am afraid that ik 
What is the lore?
They look more like 8 year olds than 12 year olds, and their present day selves look more like 12 year olds than 16 year olds. Must be the art style.
Pretty sure the manga flair is supposed to be used for, y'know, the manga, and that fan comics belong under the art flair, but this is still pretty good
Really? I’ve been setting all my fan comics under the manga flair until now…🫠
"didn't zestify him this time". . as if there wasn't any 𝒵𝐸𝒮𝒯 on this man in the first place
what is zestyfy?
It’s just shorthand for “this character looks gay”
From my understanding is to feminize a male character more than the original material yk
It's a Zoomer slang expression for "I felt attracted to this, and I don't like that I was".
I just don't like the art style at all. Wish it was closer to the game version.
Yeah it feels so off, especially when you know the artists history with young boys. The omori manga really messed up the storytelling.
Contrary to most, i lovee the art style. I wouldnt mind if it was more similar to the game, but I like the more “manga” look of this style more honestly.

Whatever he is im a #ally
I'm not really a fan of the art tbh . . It does look nice on its own but I really wish it was more accurate to the game.
We all do, buddy.
The manga looks creepy for some reason
In which way lol
Just something about it rubs me the wrong way
Could you send a source? Not that I don't believe you (especially considering the state of the internet today), but just wanna fact check things, y'know?
There is no source lol, Nui hasn’t done anything to an actual child
Why does everyone claim so, do you know? Or just people lying on the internet for fun.

this definitely looks better than the other panels I've seen, but I think using the game's artstyle would be a better choice
Agreed. But this artstyle isn't that bad tho.
Nui is such a damn weirdo.
Henry's lucky he isn't underage this time.
Can't wait to read this. Waiting for them to finish the series. They all seem so adorable, and the art style is great.
Ahh yes
I meannnn
This time?
Wow, this looks very good!!
Thanks I’m glad you liked it
One thing I really love about the manga has to be how cool the art style is. Imo the story didn't translate as well into manga as it is in the game so I would highly recommend as you said to play the game first, but I personally do still enjoy the manga but mostly just for the art (: . . Also good job on the coloring and rendering here, it looks really nice 🫶
omozing
sucks 
i meant to say sick it was auto correct im telling you
Had me in the first half
Lmfao
the manga makes them look so much shorter than i thought
There's a manga?
Yeah. If I remember correctly, you can read it on K-MANGA. Or you could travel to Japan (unless you’re already there) and buy the two volumes that are available for purchase.
I'm not in Japan
I love the detail of even the borders, text bubbles and everything being purple in the second panel. Really makes omori pop out
Beautiful, it's enough to make me cry :-)

OMOCAT !!!!!!!!. . RELEASE THE OMORI MANGA GLOBALLY AND MY 155 DOLLARS IN OMORI VINYLS + SHIPMENT COSTS ARE YOURS !!!!!!!!!. . 
Why are they in prison😔
Smh, they dont even know they fit thru the bars
Tax evasion
The adorable sillies with trauma beyond human comprehension 
ITS SO CUTE
Oh yeah there should be a new chapter in a few days. Thanks for reminding me.
Wait the third chapter's released already?
I thought the manga was coming out 2 days later? oh
Hey I just feel like there's just not much with them two but y'all enjoy
???????? The fuck are you on about
What do ya mean?
People are allowed to dislike ships that you like. . And the manga is not canon, or at least a seperate version of the story
This post is quite a bit obnoxious about a shipping opinion itself. Someone else politely commented they didn’t feel like there was much there ship-wise and got an overly aggressive response from OP. . The manga has different dialogue, completely different events to the game, and changes the characters quite a bit. It’s quite literally the same story retold differently
Yes! Kel defending Aubrey in church bugs me so much in the manga. The manga frames it as Aubrey is behaving like a monster for no reason, and then Sunny and Kel step up and defend her anyway, wiping clean their passive approach in the game, and the parts they were all at fault for. . . They’re all complex characters in a tragic situation. I don’t like the nuance being wiped away, and I don’t understand why it has to be either. I would happily read a complicated manga, maybe they were trying to make it easier to understand for new readers?
With the awful pacing of the manga, i wouldn't be surprised if the hospital part came next chapter lmao
Disasters
IT IS??
Yep, every 24th of the month i think
I’m very late to this news.. because I didn’t know there was a manga in the first place.
DAMN
probably more backlash against the artist and omocat and probably more backlash against the actual manga itself
This is the only correct answer
I dunno. Guess we just need to.... . Wait for something to happen.
Meow?. . (Waiting for something to happen?)
I still haven't read the first chapter lmao
I'm waiting for them all to come out  -w-
I'm just waiting on when it becomes available in my country
There's plenty of free VPNs if you wish to go that route, that's what I did lmao.
I forgot about vpns lmao thanks I'll do this soon been a pain to avoid spoilers
They're only releasing 1 chapter a month so you might be waiting a while lol. We don't know how many chapters there will be
A mismanaged rush of either Otherworld or Two Days Left?
HAHAHA thats the main thing i disliked about the first chapter
I Think Chapter Two Will Be An Disaster
Why?
Chapter 1 Already Was Hated Now Chapter 2….
I actually liked chapter 1
Really? Other then real world and headspace swapping places, what was bad about it? (I forgot some stuff in it so I don't remember if there was anything bad or not
Yeah but it was way more in the manga,the most she did in the game was wanting to be left alone and pushing basil into a lake acidentally. I don't think she even used that bat in the game,while in the manga she wanted to fucking kill kel for some reason?
I mean... Yeah, the manga Is an illustrative medium. It would make sense for things to be fully detailed and correctly fleshed out, more than in the game. . . I honestly wonder how they will do the lake scene. It was already heavy on the game...
Shrek
Either just a rushed rehash of the game's events that keeps mischaracterising the cast, or an actually interesting subversion of the original story, that maybe takes it in a different direction, or something.
Couldn’t have worded it better if I tried.
Depression and trauma probably
Whatever happens is going to burn fans' headcanon.. . . I'll be eating popcorn 
I just wish I could read it
I personally think it’s the arc where (the manga is based in 2024 btw I swear) Kel is knee deep into YouTube brainrot and swears he’s a sigma (he watched Patrick bateman sigmagrindset edits on the tv)
I think that the last chapter was a hook to get readers interested and the pacing is gonna slow down a lot
Space ex husband
There's an OMORI manga?
i cant believe you genuinely just found out no offense HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW
ass
Rushed content that's for sure 
I havent read the manga yet cause Im waiting for a physical copy to be released, but if it takes too long I'll just read it digitally
I’m trying to resist the urge to start reading now because I know damn well if I do my life will revolve around it till it finishes. I wanna binge read it at three in the morning on a Saturday night so I have all of the next day to cry
WAIT FR ?
The problem I see with the Manga, is that the story of omori is very unique, but that's because it was something almost never touched upon in the gaming community. I don't read Manga, but I feel like so far, it's kinda plain compared to the vast world of Manga that there is, and the smaller world of games in that genre. It was definitely meant to be completely interactive, which is the reason it was never a Manga to begin with. I feel like this is just for the fans who are unsatisfied and want more. Pretty art, retell, more omori, satisfying. Again, take my comment with a grain of salt seeing as I *dont read Manga*
Timezone please 🙏🏻
3pm GMT
Appreciate thank you
Breakdowns
Omori is gonna say its omobin time and omor all over the place
Goku dies
Nothing good, thats for sure.
Everyone remembering that it sucks
You’re average Omori speedrun will happen
they rearrange everything again
Probably the end of the game with how bad the pacing is 
damn, I need to get back on reading the manga
I read it on mangataro the day it came out.
I lost track of the manga, but.... yea he would never choke out his own brother. I don't know the context for this in the manga, but I completely disagree with this creative choice.. . We never knew what "lashing out" meant in the game because we never really saw it, but he wouldn't do that. The impression I got is that he only yelled at him and wasn't thinking clearly because of his mental state.. . I think these animatics illustrate how it went imo:. . [. . [. . . Edit: Okay, so I need to catch-up on the manga, but if it is in Sunny's headspace, then I'm a flat out dumbass.
it's headspace
Welp, I need to catch up on the manga then. Thank you and sorry about that.
They always be holding hands
they gay
You are correct
. . LET’S FUCKING GO!!! 
That’s what I said to my straight but act *gay* friends and they said nah.. *(they viciously grope each others thighs)*

That's even more gay.
Yet they still beat the allegations.
🌻🏳️‍🌈\~!
G a y  :D
. . 🏳️‍🌈
They're so cute 

We gay (:
i totally ship it lol
They should totes kisk like,,, right now,,, 
The gay boys 
They are so homosexual I swear
They're kids...Can't kids hold hands normally. Like without romance.
Well yes, but they can also hold hands romantically. I don't ship it either but there's nothing weird about having a bf/gf as a child. Most kids at that age have had a "partner" who'd they have held hands with, and nobody thinks that's weird. Apparently it's only weird when it's two boys, eh?
Can't kids also be romantic? This only ever gets brought up when its 2 boys and never when its a girl and a boy
Like fr I'll get behind the "it's just normal male friendship are like" argument when people start being just as critical to mf ships lol
Im honesty really tired of these type of comments
Adults also can do that. Kids can also have a crush on each other.
Does no one in this sub understand the word FRIENDSHIP
Friends can hold hands, but so can people who like each other. Ain't deeper than that man
Found in the Japanese Manga section of Kinokuniya. . . . Marnin-Saylor was great too!
AW what. I’ve been there many times I had no idea they had the omori manga!! Wtf
An Omori manga!? But it’s great I want to!!
I wish I could read the manga for free😔
Technically, you can! Besides sailing the seven seas, if you are in the US, you can also watch ads on K MANGA every day for a while to accumulate enough points to get chapters for free! It takes a while to get enough points, though—especially with the daily three ad limit and the fact that you will most likely only get 5 points each ad. That is how I unlocked this chapter since I wanted to read it officially for free.
Holy shit that’s awesome I’m gonna have to start doing that thanks for the info!
I wish could read legal in my country . Normally i dont care but omori have special place for me 
I agree. It’s kind of hilarious how bad both pacing and writing of the manga is, especially compared to the game. Which is the source of the manga.
I can't...I don't have a k manga account and I'm not even in the US. This is...sad.
(Same) The seas are calling, the One Piece is real!!
...As much as I know piracy would help, I can't use it.
That's fair, I am planning to buy the manga volumes if the ever become available in my area
I'm 99% sure you have to buy the chapters and I'm dirt broke :(
Dont give more money to omonetisationcat!
I mean i bought the game so... I think i already did.
I'm talking about the manga. . That's the only scene where Sunny has a dead eyed stare *in the manga*. . It could be cus he just dissociated a bit, it could be the manga decided to have omori "control" Sunny's body here which would be stupid. . Regardless, the Omori manga isn't exempt from criticism just because it's more Omori, and that was the only point I wanted to make. . It doesn't have to be a 1:1 adaptation because that's pretty much impossible, but ruining the message of the story is also a possibility, and those people "hating" on it are mostly afraid that the manga won't faithfully reflect what was shown of the characters in the game
I KNOW YOURE TALKING ABOUT THE MANGA
also it’s still chapter 1 lmao
Yahp you get it, ppl were complaining because it ruined his basic foundation for his chracter development and so called "sunny fans" doesnt even get why which really pisses me off because to this day this chracter is still mischaricterized and flanderize despite the fact we spent 80% of the game inside his head. . . The manga feels more like as a fan service rather than a standalone manga
he isn't even that expressive in the manga it's just surprise, worry, panic and fear, and it's not even exaggerated either so i don't get what you're complaining about
What did he say
Everyone in manga looks gay.. . the gayness is real
Can we get much higher.
So high~
I mean, everything that happened in chapter 1 of the manga was either the prologue or the beginning of Three days left.
to be fair even getting to the real world part of three days left takes several hours, this was all done in one chapter so...
yeah and that's like the first 10-15 hours of the game
I am concerned if that part of the game took you a whole 15 hours
That's still 3-5 hours at the very least . . But I'm personally slow so it probably took me at least 8-10 hours when I first played
Same here. I always have to examine every object and talk to every NPC
i’m glad i wasn’t the only one who thought so. I keep trying to separate the manga from the game, and judge it on it’s own merits, but quite frankly, i think i’d be thrown for a loop if this was my first introduction to the characters. so much happens in such a short period, and you cant really get a grasp on anything or anyone. hopefully future chapters will remedy this
I think they will, just like in a lot of mangas we learn about the backstory of the characters later, we will get to know the characters better after. At least that’s what I think.
oh, absolutely, I don't doubt that at all. I just mean being introduced to three separate versions of each character from the get-go is a little much. It leaves you reeling, which isn't a problem in and of itself, but it the sheer density of information means the audience can't really hook onto anything. I'm absolutely willing to give them time (I acknowledge that trying to judge the manga based on a single chapter is unfair and absurd), I just mean, had this been my first introduction to the story, I would be thoroughly confused, and uninterested (versus the game, where I was thoroughly confused, but deeply engaged)
Yeah I see
Pacing problems like these are fairly common for video game to manga or anime adaptations, so it’s unfortunate but not surprising.
Yeah, glad I’m not the only one who thinks this way, the game was a methodical slow burn that had you sitting and wandering for hours on end, the manga literally tries to cram all this in the span of a few dozen pages, like, no joke, a solid 2 hours of gameplay was reduced to 57 pages.
Yeah, I've got mixed feelings about it as well. We've just barely met these characters and they're already pushing out major plot points like the Aubrey/Basil fight and Mari's death. Why should we care about any of that when we don't even know who these people are?. . The flip side is that they seem to be assuming whoever is reading the manga has played the game, so they're speedrunning the game plot to get to new stuff quicker. Neat, I guess? I don't think I'd recommend the manga to people who've never played the game, though.. . The OTHER flip side is that I don't read a lot of manga, so maybe the breakneck pacing is common for the media.
It's not; some manga have some kind of action scene at the start, yes, but then they let you get to know the characters for a bit before things start speeding up.
Feels like mangaka didn't play the game at all tbh
I guess the manga isn't meant to be a different way of experiencing the story, instead it's meant to advertise the game to new people
Actually i think the pacing is a nice breath of fresh air, i don't WANT a full retelling of the game when i know everything about it already, especially if the manga is going to introduce new ideas, i want to be told what i know and get where we need to be
Right, but keep in mind this could be another medium that draws in new fans. So the pacing feeling natural is more important for someone new.
I mean that could be said about anything, someone might get into it via the manga and then not like the pacing of the game, idk I think the pacing is fine
Well, yeah? The point is that any medium should be self sufficient enough to draw the person in lol. . That’s exactly why it’s important
hello that’s the problem? it’s the first impression to the manga and it’s already HOURS into the game. that’s a problem.
there has been 1 (one) chapter. . i think people are overestimating the speed of how the manga will progress. . it's a prologue - wait for more chapters to release please
The first chapter of the manga is just giving you an idea of who these characters are. For people who have never played the game, they're going to read about everyone's choppy relationships in the real world, than get dragged into Omori's Headspace and the entire time they're going to wonder where everything went wrong since the gang in Headspace seem so close to one another. They were given a taste and now they're going to read each chapter with anticipation to learn why Sunny would use a knife against one of his best friends and why Aubrey would attack Basil with a bat. For us who have played the game, it's going to seem weird cause things are a bit backwards, but this style of story telling is effective. Give it a chance and try to understand that this changes nothing about the game, so even if you don't enjoy how the manga presents itself, don't be upset.
. . Omori’s beginning is a little slow, so they probably wanted to speed it up so manga readers wouldn’t get bored.
I have no clue how the company that's publishing the manga is handling this kind of stuff but considering that on social media it's specified the first chapter is free, it kind of implies others won't. If the first chapter that's suppose to hook people onto the manga doesn't do it's job, I think it's worth criticizing.
Apparenly first chapter isn't free in certain regions, [like Japan for example]() so that gives even more reason to be critical of it
I'm not a fan of the manga but the characters designs are very cute
makes sense, a big portion of the game is based on a certain someones hair. . 
Well, that's something alright
I really enjoy their manga Designs ! And yes! I think their hair is drawn very well :3
Wait, is that a steak knife? HOLD ON it was a joke. 😭😭
I hate the style and the design of the manga, it doesn't fit the story and the characters. I would have liked a style similar, but not the exact same, as Omocat style.
The problem is that this is a manga and not a comic...
But I personally love everything about the omori manga.
Those design are decent, the storyline is very well recieved than the games.
>!Omor manga Blackspace speedrun!<
Normal Something: ooga booga I’m a spooky spirit woooo. Manga Something: I AM VENGEANCE, AND I HAVE COME FOR YOU
THATS THE DAMN SOMETHING IN MANGA
Sweet.
Thats a really cool cover
No way that's awesome!!
Can someone please confirm if the manga is already in south america?
Shame I don't live in Germany. But if I did I couldn't get it cause I don't have money :(
Same situation here
Omg if it's already in Germany it shouldn't be long to show up in Portugal!!!
And in Spain!! Yay!!!
Yay!!!
Nice!
WOOWWWW
i gotta wait 6 more months
Deutschland 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Please is it in the uk I need to know. I will go to depths unknown to add this to my collection
What are people saying about it? I haven't seen much except constructive criticism.
Mainly from what I see on YT(where it is easiest to find discussion about it), people tend to criticize the flaws of the manga without devoting any time to the positives and I’ve seen a channel or two in particular saying that it isn’t good because it didn’t add anything(a weird expectation for an adaption in my opinion) and as a result shouldn’t have been made(paraphrasing, he did strongly imply this point but those weren’t his exact words).. . The pacing issue(which I feel can be explained and likely will change; even if it still isn’t as good as the game was), the characters looking younger than their in-game ages(really I don’t think this matters too much given that it’s a stylistic choice), and the changes to events all get plenty of discussion but I have only seen one channel actually spend any time discussing what it does right or how(as confusing as it can be for new readers) it does a great job at introducing the concepts and mystery that will be built up later for new readers so that they can get gripped into it.. . . Of course I don’t think the manga will ever be as good as the game, there is just too much that goes into a game that made Omori as good as it was, but I mainly only see negative discussion of it. . . The K Manga app has some more positive comments, but as far as actual discussion goes, I rarely see anything that isn’t negative.
Oh yeah that's true, people shouldn't be making reviews on the manga while ignoring the positive aspects.
I personally enjoyed the chapter, while I feel it does go too fast and RW being before HeadSpace hurts the shock of seeing the differences in RW for the first time I feel like it started how it did so that people were immediately invested from chapter 1. . . I love the storytelling of Omori but I definitely feel as if some people might drop the manga if the only thing that happened in chapter 1 was playing hide and seek and then >!Basil going missing!< and that’s my theory as to why the pacing was how it was. I hope that from now on it’ll start to slow down a little and keep up that unsettling mysterious feel that the game has.. . And a few things I like in the manga more than the game (because I agree it’s overhated and want to spread some positivity about it). I think the art style is absolutely fantastic, that paired with the fact the manga can portray emotions so much more than the game due to the fact we can see facial features adds so much imo. My favourite part is definitely just how much impact >!Aubrey being stabbed!< had, the full page illustration and just how she reacted feels so much more genuine than in the game where she almost immediately gets up and rides her scooter home.. . (TLDR; Good chapter, hope it starts slowing down a little with chapters to come)
I definitely agree with this, I just think the scene itself was done better in the manga. The pacing of RW before Head Space does 100% dampen everything that happens in ch1 tho due to the switch around
I completely agree here. In the end it has its flaws and it has areas it excels.. . I’m really excited to see what direction this takes(especially given that the game is route based, making me wonder if they’ll approach it in a linear way and do one route or maybe adapt both routes separately)
100%. While I think we will inevitably be going towards true ending I would love to see some of the Hikikomori route exclusive stuff, especially >!Snowglobe Mountain and Space Ex-Boyfriend!<. All in all, I’m super excited to see where it goes
Really? Not even out for a month yet and we're getting the   . "The manga is overhated"  . posts?. . It is my assumption that we would be elated to see a new piece of official content bringing the story to a new art medium and by extension a new audience.. . God, we really ARE an indie fandom aren't we?
~~Actually I intended to make this post on day 1 or 2 of the manga being released because that’s when the manga hate started but I’m lazy~~. . Yeah, sadly it has not been very well received and the flaws get highlighted without any attention to what it does right. I’ve talked with a few other people about that in this post so I’m hopeful that the subreddit will be more fair to it than YouTube is.. . And yeah, just like the Omori manga has positives and flaws, the community is the same. There are cool people, there’s those that kinda blend together, there are those who are neutral, and then there’s a vocal minority that tend to judge unfairly.. . I’m hoping that the public reception of it will be more fair by the time of chapter 2.
If you here anything on day 1 then yes, it's overhating by definition. You do not have nearly enough information to make a well structured opinion, and all that comes out is bias.
I do feel the manga is a bit over hated, even though I understand the complaints. While I did enjoy the subtlety and horror twists when the game >!started in Headspace,!< I always enjoy the >!real-world!< story and characters way more anyway, lol. Yes, the first chapter started off with the >!real world!< instead of the >!dream world!< caught me off guard and I am worried the details on >!Mari’s fate!< was revealed too early but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the manga. The mangaka claimed in her tweet that Omocat has helped her with ideas whenever the mangaka gets stuck. I’m still really looking forward to the upcoming chapters, with hopefully the pacing will slow down.. . Oh, and my favourite YouTuber who does reviews for anime, never played OMORI but actually enjoyed the manga a lot. So that made me happy that some non-OMORI fans can enjoy the manga too for what it’s worth. (Titled “This Manga and Game Saves My Life” by Chibi Reviews)
Yeah, when I mentioned that there was one channel that I found who was positive, that’s the one I was talking about.
I read the manga yesterday, and was honestly shocked just how botched the story is. Omori’s story and especially the way it’s told is what, in my opinion, elevates it from a mid-tier Earthbound clone to a potentially prime example of how to do interactive storytelling. Very impressive especially for an indie title. So seeing exactly that story being so bastardized hurts even more. . . I think the biggest criticism I can give is that it doesn’t feel like somebody approached Omocat because they really wanted to retell the story in a manga, but rather that Omocat wanted a real Japanese mangaka do a real Japanese manga of her game. . . I might be very, very wrong of course but I just don’t see the point of the manga.
I actually like the changes! It being fast makes ir very interesting and I'm excited to see how they'll do dreamspace. Also the art is AMAZING!! 
I'm not a fan of the pacing at all, and the artstyle, while not objectively bad, just doesn't really look right to me. Idk what exactly it is about it that I dislike. Not in-character for OMORI as a concept I feel. I'm also slightly disappointed that the manga isn't an expansion of the story, but an adaptation of the existing one instead.. . One thing I do like though is that, with closer and more detailed looks at the characters and how they react to things (facial expressions and body language that the RPG format of the game kinds hides from us), we can gain better insight into how characters are feeling in a moment.. . I don't hate the manga at all. I quite enjoy it actually! But I do feel like some things could've been done better. Maybe there are extra details that the manga will show us, like maybe >!what led up to the stairs incident!< or >!what happens after Sunny's confession.!<
ikr! im so sick and tired of hearing all this criticism after only one chapter. no one is giving it a chance and are just jumping to conclusions. if it turns out to be awful, then fine, but ppl could at least hold out all their awful criticism until then
Honestly, despite the pacing issues and the odd choice of having RW start rather than HS, I still love the manga regardless. I’m genuinely interested to see how they run with these changes. . . I’m willing to give it a chance, and am especially excited to see how the manga adapts future fights.
but i love the manga
If you're right, I give it the benefit of the doubt since it has 1 chapter, until we see the other chapters I won't judge it.
i can’t believe people waited this long for it to come out and be hyped about it just to hate on it
From experience, this is how it is, with many media such as games, mangas/comics and books; When the expectation is high, there is always bitter disappointment from the fans because they are always louder than those who are satisfied are silent.
yeah that’s true
Personally, I'll let it cook for a bit before giving it a much thorough review.
Wait people hate it
I don't hate the manga personally and I'm fine if it's continuing the same storyline from the game. My only compliant is how there's potential into the manga that they can able to add that never made into the game story and give more character development for the staff.
Me, thinking about Omori for the first time in a while:  "Wait, there's an Omori *manga*???  :o"
Yeah, chapter 1 was released a bit ago and chapter 2 will release soon. you can read for free on K Manga in some countries. Otherwise the subreddit lists VPN services to access it.
Is the manga monthly? Or weekly
Monthly. We are very close to the next chapter.
i dislike it because the art feels off. Like the type of off where I'm like "i know what you are"
I fully agree with this but also, as someone who was pulled into playing the game bc of the art style, I would appreciate it even if there WAS no grand twist/different story, simply because we get much clearer, more detailed images and depictions of the events, as well as a lot more characterization. Like sunny has a lot more facial expressions in just the first chapter of the manga than he did in the entirety of the game. I loved seeing him shocked and shaken to see Aubrey and Basil for the first time, for example, a scene where we get no input from him in the game. . . I also just really fucking love the art style, every single page of the manga is worthy of being made into a poster if u ask me.
Gonna be honest, I was surprised when they changed the order of the Manga to the game but now I'm not necessarily that shocked. There are a lot of parts in Headspace gameplay that would just be boring in the Manga. Walking around just doing Sidequests, >!murdering bunnies and stuff.!<. . Now, they could have done a prologue. It wouldn't mess with the >!"not knowing how your friends reacted"!<. And it would give Insight to what happened before >!The Incident!<, also introducing something new to the whole story. But I'm no professional.. . I'll still recommend people to play the game first.
I don't really mind starting in RW versus headspace for the manga. I still think you can make the flipping impactful and most people reading the manga know the story already so it wouldn't make sense to slog through the "playing with friends" beginning imo. Plus to new readers it sets up conflict that makes it interesting to learn WHY there's conflict. It poses the questions up front to answer with the story later.
It's overhated...? Oh, man. Thanks to the skies I haven't met much hate from it myself. Adapting video games into mangas or series/animes is hard work. It doesn't always turn out perfect, either, but the attempt is made and I appreciate that, so I have hopes that the OMORI manga will better its pacing (because I'm not a fan of it either but it's the first chapter, after all). For now, I'm personally loving the art style. ❤️
I think it's badly paced
The manga is ok but a lot of things a missing the art style dosent fit the story or the characters and in general all the characters look 12 the pacing is horrible a lot of scenes and other stuff was cut off for example Aubrey church scenes which shows her dad left and how everyone views her as a brat and how hard it's been for her second the scary elements of omori are just completely missing and the story overall is somehow made completely uninteresting they should've used the original omori art style made the pacing accurate and stick to the game timeline with only a couple of changes if they did that I feel like the manga could be a great start to people that haven't played the game
In my personal opinion the omori manga is incredible. We can clearly see that they respected the work and the characters and even took liberties to avoid making a simple copy and paste of the games. The fact that the story advances more quickly also allows us to avoid getting tired of the story in the middle and to be able to get to the most interesting part quickly without skipping part of the story.
It deserves it really. They bout' to make the whole story in 10 chapters
 it ain’t hated enough frankly. the product itself in isolation is… fine, i guess, but when considering outside factors i just can’t help but hate the thing; it’s clearly a cash-grab and the videogame elements that are so heavily embedded into omori’s storytelling that make it such a unique experience just cannot translate. that, and the style is really gross, the mangaka is a bit dodgy.. just feels like it was either done for money or just for the sake of it (and omocat loves they fuckin money, that’s all i’m saying).
the manga iz really ugly I don't know why they changed the artstyle that was perfect for a manga and really really pretty
It's the style of the Mangaka, who was probably the only one who offered to adapt the game. Not bad, it's typical of many mangas.
Crazy take
Omg, I love the shading and lighting you did on this panel!!! 
That is actually very good
man I love these 
FIRE
love how everyone turned the manga into a colouring book lmao. Anyways, amazing colouring! Love the shading and the colours look great!
I'm not good at line art but I want to colour things too, so I just hopped on the train lol
Actually really good coloring, really brings out the danger and shock of the scene, more than just treating the manga like a coloring book.
Cool
Cool 
context ?
Nice
I know, but I’m glad it’s diverging a little from the video game story. I feel it would be a little boring if it was too similar to the original, hehe…. . But yeah, it’s super fun and cool and stuff. It’s a real emotional rollercoaster. The stabbing scene was pretty shocking.
Stabbing became murdering, bruh
If she didn't block the attack, her throat would've been cut, omfg... Wild.... 
Officer, she simply slipped and fell on my knife . . It’s not murder if she was clumsy. Her own fault, really
Oh god that is WAY MORE than a stab
Well, it wasn't even a stab ingame to begin with, it was a slash. But yeah, here it's goddamn Britain: demo version

the game wasn't a stab either
Ah yes depression
I find it kinda cool the all the nails are facing inwards to avoid puncturing her victims.. . . It's basically just an armored baseball bat
Nothing is impossible, the word itself says 'I'm possible'
So, I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you.
Was the text changed or is it just me?
Aubrey in the manga makes you wanna smack her lmao
Dam, amazing
Yeah the pacing is fucked up and nothing makes sense to both the people who already played the game and those who didn't. I dont like it so far. Although i will read ahead to see if it'll get better
Speaking facts. I love the art but the pacing feels...really really off.
Yeah, i just hate that it starts directly from the christmas scene, and the whole real world sequence is so short and abrupt. And the fact that headspace doesn't even happen while he's dreaming and just knocked out. These are just a few things wrong about the manga, but i could go on, honestly.
I feel like what first got me interested in the game in the beginning was the subversion of headspace with the "harsh reality" of the real world, and that is completely lost in the manga adaptation.
I like it a lot so far.. . A lot of people are upset about the changes to the plot, yet I doubt anyone would enjoy reading a whole chapter about kids playing hide and seek without context, if the plot was to follow the game to the T.. . Manga needs an audience from chapter 1 onwards, so I understand why they did the way they did, as the story is immediately gripping and understandable to someone unfamiliar with the game.. . It's still early to judge imho, we'll see how it deals with more heavy themes as they come, but judging on the few key scenes we already got expanded (like Aubrey looking down on the album she just threw away), I am quite hopeful.
omori's format as a videogame is instrumental to its story, changing it to a manga's format takes away from the effectiveness of the story. also there's NO MUSIC IN THE MANGA. DUET. THINK ABOUT FINAL DUET WITH NO MUSIC.
The first teaser image made me think they were gonna change Headspace to be manga-themed instead of game-themed. I wonder how that would have turned out.
we simply have to see how it goes as it continues go along. i’m really looking forward to all the emotional moments with the manga’s abilities to convey the character’s redesigned facial expressions. i feel like the turmoil will hit that much harder in manga form.
I actually don't mind that they decide to introduce the RW first since most people who are reading the manga already played the game before, however I do think the pacing is too quick, like the story so far (Ch.1~3) could be stretched out to around 5~7 chapters, I do think it's getting better though, also I love the art style I think they look amazing, can't wait to get more of them
Good art but I don't like how it retells the events of the game
I don’t like it. It does a bad job retelling the story for new fans, and doesn’t show anything new for old fans. the art is nice though
Honestly, a big part of OMORI is the soundtrack. Like, what do you expect to feel when there's no music accompanying the relaxation, tension or emotional moments? Especially when we all know and love that one ( or two ) soundtrack in the game that greatly contributed to the ending of the story. Manga will not have the same impact it would to a player experiencing the game.
Why are people downvoting this comment? The OP asked for the community's genuine thoughts on the manga, and this user simply answered it honestly.. . Wow, they weren't wrong when they said Reddit is a hive mind.
IMO I don’t like the art style, it literally makes everyone so flamboyant and I hate it
i don't like it. game is waaaay better
Why... Just, Why?. . Omori is a game that is influenced by your actions and choices. the manga doesn't give you those things. Also, a lot of the gameplay is happening in Headspace and is filler despite being so important to the plot, ambiance, and experience of the player. the manga can not give you that
>Why… Just, Why?. . Because it’s neat bonus content especially when you’ve already experienced the game, the consequences of your *actions and choices* aren’t as impactful once you know the different outcomes to be fair.. . While readers can’t experience the same stuff as players, the Manga can still use foreshadowing and subtle background details to boost the ambience of the world, it’s only reached Chapter 3 and we’ve hardly seen Headspace yet so it’s hard to judge anything.
I dont like the artstyle.
I can't wait for Omori vs Mahoraga
. . Definitely one of the best fights
First chapter was horrendous, 2nd and 3rd were pretty good. .   . "The game already exists, make it different.". .   . "...". .   . "I think I'll monitor your story a bit closer from now on."
What's with the quotations?
How I imagine the manga developement
I like it
i like it, after reading the released chapters so far, and i agree i do see it more as a bonus than a replacement (it should not be a replacement for the game). . i do understand ppl's gripes about it tho, like the pacing does seem a bit weird to me, like they're speedrunning the plot or something in chpt 1 and the fact that it's a manga with very little color and music, but i always listen to the ost while i read. . i honestly had no issues with the fact that it takes dialog from the guidebook i think, i don't have the guidebook yet, so ┐(´∀｀)┌ or the fight with boss having the battle textboxes, i thought it was cute to include them (i think ppl are being a lil too nitpicky about it imo). . i like the art a lot (especially with the creepy unsettling moments), and i really don't care about the mangaka's history that much as long as she just makes this manga a good enjoyable story (which to me she has succeeded so far)--i've read and enjoyed plenty of manga where the mangakas have weird histories so nothing new here. i think ppl hyperfocus on that a bit too much, and it levitated their hate towards omori as a whole, i'm honestly tired of seeing all this hate on omocat, like what's done is done, u move on and be a better person, don't let ur past define u and stuff but anyway, ye the manga's flawed but good imo, looking forward to more \(:3」∠)\
Not really liking it so far, But because I'm autistic and this game is my special interest I'll take any new content. I'm kinda half enjoying it ig.
It's okay but the art style is still not my favourite. Wasn't there some drama with the one drawing it?
I can't get into it due to the artstyle
Not a fan of style. And people say it's underwhelming plotwise sooo I probably won't be checking it out.
It's really cool for someone who already played the game.
I think it’s pretty neat 👍
. . Ryo pfp
I don’t really know where to read it so idk what’s going on
Personally I enjoy the retelling, but I’ve also replayed the game about seven times since it’s come out so the changes make it more exciting for me since every page feels like a new adventure in a fictional world I love very much.
Personally I dont like the pacing, dont get me wrong though the art is amazing and so is the interpretation but the pacing is not that good.
its awesome. cant wait for the chapter 4!
I have to read it
I found the first chapter really rushed, but it started improving after. I really liked the additions they made with chapter 3 last month and I'm excited to see how the new chapter is.
I can't say much since I've only read chapter one. However, what I will say about it is that I think it's not very good. The art style looks okay at best I suppose, not just because it makes me uncomfortable but also because I just think it's not very good and makes the characters look very uncanny.. . Also from what I heard there were plot changes? Which, I can't speak much about so I won't speak much about it, however if that's true then I really don't like that. If the manga is canon and it takes place in the same universe then it should be the same story. . . Also the way that they're approaching the story is very unnatural at best. Why are they doing a mix of both worlds at the same time? That's going to hit the reader a lot less, especially when it comes to the "real world Aubrey = bad" parts of the manga. In the game, it hit me hard once I found out that Aubrey was not a good person in the real world and that Sunny was using a knife to attack her when the game didn't tell me.. . The real world coming first - as well as the knife being shown - takes away all of that. It also takes away the realization that you know who is not really here (not going to say because of spoilers plus I'm on mobile, so no formatting :') ). I'm not sure if the artist/omo really understands how vital the way they can tell a story can be, it can really change a viewer's perspective and feelings on the characters.. . Also... being a manga, they're going to have to try really hard to make the final parts of the manga (such as final duet, the hospital room, Basil's house, the omori fight, etc) feel depressing and anxious. Some of these things relied solely on video game mechanics, such as music and boss fights. They might do well with Basil's house (maybe Sunny could talk to Basil, idk) but I'm not entirely sure about anything else - ESPECIALLY final duet! That part relied on two things: visuals and a song to make you feel depressed. Now they only can rely on visuals. . . Honestly I feel like they shouldn't have made an Omori manga adaptation at all. It probably would've been better if it was, like a spin-off Omori manga or something that tells a new story.. . That's just my opinion on it I guess. Again I've only read chapter 1 so I could be wrong about some things.
I dind't even played the game yet
Haven't read it, don't intend to. No reason in particular, I just don't know why I would when I've already played the game
It doesn't give off the "manga feeling" tbh, it feels more like a manhwa
theres a WHAT NOW?
i like it!
dont like anime
Decent adaptation as an anime/manga/lightnovel/manhwa/manhua enjoyer & gamer , technically speaking I frankly think this adaptation has a decent way trying to convert the game plot in manga format = oh ignore any controversy aside THE ART of the manga is both very well done & that creepy hehe
I have mixed opinions about it,in one hand,i wont forget what the artist of the manga did and in the other hand,i really loved some panels in the manga (like hellmari,something,sunny and basil staring at each other lmao) honestly,thats it
bad
It’s interesting, and that’s all I’m gonna say because I haven’t read it
Didn't we forget about it like a month ago...?
Artsyle sucks
I think it’s trash
Bad,like,Really REALLY Bad.
I always get that massage so I can’t read the manga but I really want to! It looks amazing!
Yes fr 😭
I’ve never been crazy about the manga’s artstyle. They all look super malnourished.
All y’all do is complain this looks fire. . 
People just don’t like the omori manga, that’s really it
ITS BEAUTIFULLLL
my bro chopped
Damn he look good I don't fucking get why y'all complaining about his face?
Wait the manga is over?? I thought it came out only in June
Nope, it's for the end of the volume

She think she looks intimidating 😭😭
She looks super cute 😭
Smol kitty
Lol 🤣
It looks like she's wearing clown shoes

Is the manga worth it? I can't bring myself to read it since the first chapter was completely incoherent with what Omori's start was.... Does it get better? Or does it stay like that?
Ive been wanting this ever since the manga began. I just caught up and i have been popping off for the last 15 minutes. I'm wearing my bossman shirt rn. This is the peak of hyperfixation and I don't think i will ever top the pure joy i felt seeing him once again.. . . ALSO HE HAS SLIT PUPILS WHICH IS A HEADCANNON IVE HAD FOR YEARS SOJVDJDVSOJ. Im normal. Yep
I haven't played the console version, but yepp I think bossman Hero is so cool, and he turned out so good in the manga tooo
wait the manga is still ongoing what
Do you think the manga is ever gonna be in America?
I am surprised we still haven't gotten an English physical release yet, it would sell like crazy
I don't know if the english one has a physical copy too since I am from germany as well and got the german one. I only know that the chapters are released online in english on K Manga I think
There’s an omori manga??
Yup :)
Well done :3 (I wish I could have the physical manga, I have a couple from other anime’s but I don’t have omori :P
Omori isn't an anime, it's a US-American video game, but still, go get it!
Oh, I know.! :) I have played omori before, I am not finished with it yet but thank u for saying something.!! ❤️ I still appreciate it. :3
THERE'S A GERMAN OMORI MANGA???????
No, this is a fabrication of your mind
Oh, damn. Shame.
Yeah, honestly surprised that people still think German actually exists. . It's like believing that Trump exists
UGHHH, I wish I liked the manga
I DISNT THINK HED BE IN THE MANGA
How are you feeling?
spinnileaf just control your breathing, we don't want you to pass out
Checking in as well Eye Twin. You ok?
To quote Squidward….. (Cough) (Cough). Oh No He’s HOT!!!!
Bro thinks that this post took a weird route🥀
Like uh, hey, things may have taken a Hikikomori Route right now.
HE EVEN HAS SHARK TEETH
AND THE SLIT PUPILS!!
He's giving me Makima vibes
. . "No, you don't"
OKAY I GET IT, HE'S HOT- WHY IS THE WRITING SO ON THE NOSE??? 😭😭😭. .   . I haven't read the manga since like chapter 4,,.,, 💔😔
It is very on the nose haha
PEAK HELLO???
what chapter is this
11
I caught up today and i have a headache from the pure hype. 
Where to read it?
Kmanga app
Omori's face is in true disbelief 
[[ATACK]]          [SKILL]. . [ITEM]               [TOY]
Furious. . 
I have an idea. . 
Nice where did you buy it at?
RemindMe! 1 day

Where did y get it from?

WHERE
I don't know if you'll ever see this message, but I'd like your help because I'm trying to make my physical version in Spanish and I'd need photos of the extras and the hardcover.  . Thank you very much for reading it.
The hardcover I mean the Headspace cover
Off topic but what on earth happened to the Reddit gui?
What if my new job was to color omori manga pages... Can I do that too???
I’m sure you can!!
Ok I'll!!
bro's my successor...
sick
YESYSSYES
WHERE CAN I READ THE MANGA??
[this]() should help you out. The desc has the link to the manga and the top comment tells how to read outside of supported countries!
YAY TYSM
We live in a society aahh dialogue
&#x200B;. . 
Why does her tie have so much shadow
Where do they live, the Cascades?
Putting aside the yaoi manga for a second and putting on my analysis glasses, I love how disturbed Omori looks. Almost guilty knowing what he has done, if not scared. I'm loving these expressions!
I know right ? They turned this scene from the game to manga
I got really unlucky looking for Basil . . Also Kmanga is the official source for the manga in English
Ohhhh lol :3. . TYY!!!
OP is foreshadowing this. . 


pleasedontmakehimblondpleasedontmakehimblond
Wait i didn't read the manga why is Hero blonde
His hair changes color based on
r/redditsniper
His on a pursuit
Super Saiyan
“I heard your positive mindset is pretty strong”. . 
Bro acting like >!his girlfriend died or smth!< 🙄
Get that blonde out of him I do not wanna see it
Bro turned super saiyan
there's 2 options, either goku or uhhhhhgggggggggm
That shading of the hair in the last panel was not it bro
too many strands for a lazy fellow like me bruh
Fair enough i guess
How incredible it turned out! I loved the painting :)
NO NO IT'S BLONDE NONONONO
Someone dye his hair back please


Nah this kind of thing is veeeery common in first run manga and usually gets fixed in subsequent releases like volumes or omnibuses
Sir this is the OMORI fandom I saw people accuse Nui of using AI because they didnt like the way she draws hair.
You have a point…
The big thing about the Omori manga is that Omori’s original story doesn’t work as well when not in a game. I think the changes done to the story here utilize the medium well. It can’t be one to one Omori so it shouldn’t try to be
wait i didn't know this game got a manga!! :o
i had such low expectations cause i dont like the rest of the manga art but hes so mich begyer than i expected
So the manga is out and now producing everywhere including internet? How did I miss this much?
Manga artist turned him from like 5'3 to like 3ft tall bruh
Why do people act like it's a disaster that it's paid? It's the fourth post I see complaining about that. . Like the author, the writers, the artists and all the others working on the manga gotta eat somehow.. . I understand pirating it since Kmanga isnt available anywhere outside of the US (at least I think, I'm in Canada and I assume that if they arent available in the country next door, I assume they aren't much more anywhere else), but the fact that it's paid should not be a dissapointment or anything. It's supposed to be NORMAL to pay for a product.. . Tho do feel free to sail on the seven seas until Kmanga finally get their act together or until the Manga gets distributed physically (which I myself will buy when it will happen)
im getting downvoted for this take in another post lol. god forbid an artist profits from their hard work!
Nah my problem is that they set a precedent that it will be free on kmange, also I’m broke and can’t afford anything other than free
The 3 free chapters always been something that existed for YEARS before Omori's manga though.. . Heck Kmanga is not the only manga site to do smth like that. It's always been a thing. . The whole point is to allow readers to see if the manga interest them before buying, similarly to the 3 episode rule for anime
Sir I have never used a manga site before and was completely blindsided so disappointment is expected
That is fair, tho I had no idea that most of the omori community didnt used a manga site before. I honestly just expected most of yall to know at least the basic things :<. . My apologies for that, but I didnt know until now
I hadn’t before this, either. So yeah, I got kinda blindsided.. . Currently deciding on if I’ll do it now, or wait until a while after it’s finished to see if it ever gets a physical release.
My apologies for making a comment without reaching if it was normal, I was just having a bad day hoping to read the new chapter when I got surprised by it and immediately posted about it. I will try to research topics in depth before posting
That's good, tho do not worry too much about it. It's okay to not know everything, and as long as you learn when smth like our conversation happens, that's what matters.
Had they been charging from the start i wouldn’t have cared
As I said in my previous response, having the few first chapters free is smth completely normal that has been done for entire years, to allow readers to know if the product interests them before committing to the purchase
Welp I my defense you never stated in your statement that the first three chapters are usually free and I never used kmanga before this came out
Look it shouldnt be my job to expect that someone reading a manga digitally does NOT know the basic things of manga reading online, so I had no need to explain the 3 chapter "rule" in my original comment.. . Tho at least now I do know that I should be more precise now
And also plus it's only like a dollar per chapter
Can you send a picture of the SOMETHING page in chapter 1? No real reason I'm just personally curious.
yeah sure, lemme just open it lol!!
Can I have a link to where you bought them? . (Or if you bought them via aa actual store don't worry)
yeah, it was in an actual store in tokyo, sorry!!
Is Tokyo cool, OP?
yeah, it is, the stuff i can buy (like merch or snacks) are a lot cheaper than where i live, so it's great, would def revisit tokyo next year!
If you wanna buy a copy online you can use CDJapan.
good..NOW. . # R E A D !
YEAH I WILL-!! :)
Given it hasn't released in English yet, that's going to require a decent reading level in Japanese
im not fluent but i know a decent amount (primary school level) japanese, mainly because i did primary school at Taito Kuritsu Kuromon before moving..!!
Oh that's cool
Oh man, i really want that
i actually got it in tokyo for about ¥830 or something
Do you remember where the store was? So i will go buy one
its "Animate Akihabara アニメイト秋葉原" . i think u could still find it there cus there were like 3 books left when i got them this morning.. . im pretty sure they have more in stock
Thanks🙏
THERE A MANGA WHATATAT?!?!??
I'm actually confused how are you JUST finding out about this
I’m a new Omori fan lol
THAT'S GREAT OP  HAVE FUN READING
i will. thank youuu!!
This is real right?
Personally, the fact that hoolingans do not appear would be a much more stable decision.. . It gives more personality to the game and helps make the manga's plot more versatile and faster.. . I like the idea that the manga focuses on just exploring the main characters and doing it well.
Some people apparently don’t like that it doesn’t perfectly match with the game.
It’s like this with all sorts of stuff. Manga fans hate on anime when it’s not identical. Book fans hate on movies when it’s not identical. That shit is everywhere. People just gotta learn that different mediums mean some changes have to be made. I think it’s fair to criticize the fast pacing but it’s much too early to already be hating on the manga and claiming it’s awful after 2 chapters.
Most people don't hate it cause of that though, the artstyle combined with the artist's history is uncomfortable to say the least
Same but I was a little disappointed they removed the emotions and the ye old sprout battle because I always wondered how they would recreate follow-up skills and ultimate attacks in the manga and they just cut it off
They removed ye old sprout?. . 0/10 already, they did NOT cook.. . >!I haven’t read them yet!<
R.I.P Ye Olde Sprout. . He was a true father to us all…
They might show it more later.
Hope so, probably in the space bf fight
a manga just coming out doesn't make it immune to criticism. Omori content being rare doesn't mean you have to eat up and ENJOY all omori content no matter how unsatisfactory it is either. I don't have to be grateful for an omori manga, at the end of the day it's still a piece of media that's designed to make money and promote the game, not a gift from omocat. Your argument might be valid for something like a fanart contest with prizes sponsored by omocat for the community, but this is not like that. Besides, people are allowed to have negative opinions about things, and "bad pacing" is a perfectly fine reason to dislike the manga.. . Edited because i sounded like an asshat
Took the words right out of my mouth. I hate this concept of forced gratitude for content, as though creators are blessing their fans with it. Criticism should always be encouraged because it keeps creators improving and makes it so they put more effort into their work.
my thoughts exactly
Just because it just came out doesnt mean it's immune to critisism, thats ridiculous. . Plus everybody (understandably) wants a different artist and hates this one
Wait, why?
I can't say without getting my comment deleted i fear but theres probably some stuff about it on r/omorimeta
Good call, there’s also an r/omorimanga, but don’t know their rules on that discussion.
That’s not even what everyone’s hating on. I’ve seen many people praise the art. I understand why you would want a different artist (I know the artist lore) but I haven’t really seen people talking about it as much as how good the art itself is. People are mostly just hating on the fast pacing from what I’ve seen (which is fair).
I see a lot of people hating on both the artist and the art. Even before the artist got outed there was talk about not liking the art style
Where? I saw discourse about it when the first chapter came but since the newest chapter I’ve mostly seen praise of the art.
idk, twitter, reddit, private circles, tumblr, scattered all over the place. i think i mightve made a post myself somewhere on insta talking about how i really dislike the artstyle when it was first announced
Interesting. I’m not really on social media like that but I’ve mostly seen praise on this subreddit. I personally like the art style honestly but I’m definitely not against changing the artist because of who they are.
Why dont u go on main so everyone can see what a wonderful person you are
It is noted that many are not familiar with manga, many manga have fast pace at the beginning to pace to capture the audience's interest, then the plot softens.
Just because you liked something doesn't mean you can't criticize it. And altough I enjoyed the manga, i do have 1 massive issue with it. And that's with Sunny.. . In the original game, Sunny is often described by various characters as being a bit stoic and emotionally unexpresssive. A lot of times when we see him in the real world and headspace do mirror this fact. It is an aspect of his character that i really enjoyed as a lot of victims of trauma have trouble expressing emotions often, and the character development he went trough as he started getting more expressive the more he uncovered the truth as to what happened to Mari, was something I really enjoyed and does mirror well what happens when a person processes trauma.. . And what does the manga do? It basically takes that away from him, as he might be more expressive than all the other characters in the manga. It takes away what made him stand out as a character from the rest of the group and what made his character development so appealing. . . In game, his lack of emotional expression made Sunny so weirdly eerie but also add a unique charm to him, and the rare times where he did show emotion made those moments much more precious.. . It's not a complete deal breaker as I am still enjoying the manga, but I still wanted to put this out there.
I'm genuinely surprised the manga inspired such excitement in you, considering that it just feels like a very headcanon'y recap of the game's events. Kinda reminds me of the Yume Nikki manga - great art, but just kinda Nothing going on besides putting some vaguely cool visuals into a different format.. . . I don't think OMORI fans are that starved for content - we have the calendar, the stickers, the plushies, the figurines... The manga just feels like it exists for the sake of existing, it's not a good adaptation that reveals something interesting to returning fans, nor is it a good introduction to people who don't know the game. It's just so rushed, man, it feels odd that it even exists.. . . Granted, I have not read the second chapter, so, if it actually takes the story in a different direction, it'll be at least something interesting!
Who knows we might get the omori gang's reaction to the confession in the end (the pacing in chapter 2 is really good)
why don't you read before you yap
"Don't ask questions! Just consoom product then buy the next product!". . …That's a deranged mentality to have.
uhhh sounds like a pretty normal mentality to have with entertainment? or do you go on hating on all the movies/books/anime/manga etc for years before you can move on??
You mean "Just consoom product then buy the next product" without question? I'm pretty sure that's just you.
why so srs bro
What...?
Wtf is this toxic positivity post 💀. . “JUST ENJOY AND CONSUME MEDIA!!”. . People probably have good reason to not like this or that. I can’t tell cause I’m not American and therefore can’t read the damn thing
I like it I just hate the art style cuz everyone looks so much younger :(
I actually think the art style is really cute and good but I still want an artist change because of who the artist is 🤮
Honestly, the primary thing that could have been done better was giving headspace a more distinct visual flair. Maybe even setting Omori's design more apart from the rest since that does carry quite alot of importance with it.. .   . But I think some part, escpecially the creepy aspects, are translated very well into the manga.. .   . It is not bad, but everything can always be better of course!
people are allowed to not like things
I really like the manga. And i really like the fact that it doesn't match 100% to the game, meaning more suprises
I think the Omori manga should also be enjoyable to new viewers, and that's the problem, since the first part is so fast it'll be confusing to new viewers.
im not judging the entire manga before it's come out, but a bad start is a bad start. i think someone who hasn't played the games before would be confused by chapter 1, and a lot of the things that were dramatic reveals in the game have had all their tension totally neutered    .     . i am enjoying the manga in some ways and i'm hoping it can get better from here but so far it seems like it's not something that i would recommend to someone who hasn't already played the game. and i was hoping that it would be
it is actually getting kinda annoying tbh
People are so ungrateful that we even have it
I mean just because it’s new content doesn’t mean you have to like it though lmao
…Which is kinda similar to what is happening with The Elder Scrolls, or even Fallout, especially in regards to the (current) IP owners such as with the latter.
Yeah ikr!!
I don't want to go looking for hate so idk what people are saying about it. But what I personally didn't like was that it started with the real world and then introduced the dream world. I thought it was more impactful that the start of the game was fantasy and then introduced the real world. BUT I would think that most people reading the manga already know how the story goes ¯⁠\⁠⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠⁠/⁠¯ And this is a sort of reimagining, so it's cool to subvert expectations
Wish I could read the damn chapter at all there was a big storm and I haven't had internet for 8 hours 
Don't worry, we'll express concern if and when this manga does particularly weird things... This doesn't strictly include incredibly superfluous messages that only modern Disney would adore.
"Ignore all of the controversies" no
The controversies dont really affect the manga.  So just ignore it and enjoy reading.  You don’t need to hate on something just because the creator might like some things.
“might like some things” is a WILD way of putting it
The art style kinda freaks me out but I haven’t actually read it yet
i really didnt like the art style specially in the first chapter . but i see it is better in the second one
Mm! Say what you want about the art (or just the manga as a whole), but it certainly does horror well. Definitely excited for Black Space, hehe ^ ^
Where does one go to read the manga?
Kmanga
Do NOT upload full manga chapters here. It is a violation of copyright and violates Reddit's TOS. You are free to send it in dms.
Chainsaw Man or something idk I don't read manga
or watch anime probably
can a GORDON FREEMAN play omori?. . hey, i'm a fairly mature 27 year old black mesa scientist and have already been exposed to a lot of omori's themes in real life. i caused a resonance cascade, so i've been exposed to a lot of death and have killed a fair few headcrabs and hecu units. i've heard gman talk about bringing me out of stasis for hl3, i really want to play and know that I can live, however i haven't slept in 6 days straight. with the manga coming out, i feel like it would be a great time to play. Not to mention the fact that i'm described as a highly trained professional. What do you think?
you should totally add chiyo from azumanga daioh
TSUKURIMASHOU‼️‼️‼️ TSUKURIMASHOU‼️🔥. . SATE SATE NANI GA DEKIRU KA NA 🗣️🗣️🔥
Hero not being buff is incredibly important, what are you talking about? It will make or break the manga. I'm not being weirdly specific about what I want to see in the manga! Nooooo, what?. . (\^this is a joke)
theres a manga??? 
Yep but the first chapter is still being made
i never thought omori would be able to get a manga! wow! i dont think i would be able to get it anyway because it probably wont be sold in my country but i can still read it online maybe...
Wait what manga-
Omori is getting an official manga adaption!
Ooooooh that's pretty cool! 
...manga?
Omori is getting an official manga adaption!
when is it getting it?
I have no idea
Omori's getting an official manga adaptation
Wait what?? What manga?
They're making an official manga for Omori!. . my headcanon appearances are going to be blasted to smithereens! :) ~~\* sobbing \*~~
Oo fun! And noooo my precious headcanons ☹️
Yep, but the first chapter is still being made
Got it!
WHAT MANGA?!
THEY'RE MAKING AN OFFICIAL OMORI MANGA!
IS THIS REAL?!?!? AM SHAKING
Imagine this being the first time I hear of Omori getting a manga. I always imagined he would be average build, at least in RW he seems like the kind of guy to keep fit but not super athletic iykwim.
but back to the manga, i 100% see the appeal, but you can't really go into it without playing the game. it feels rushed and there's a lack of plot exposition and character development in my opinion
I really don’t understand the issue with the paywall, the chapters are cheap and the app literally gives people a way to earn points for free anyway. Not to mention the fact that if you’re following the manga as it comes out it’s like a dollar or so a month. . . As for the comments about the “gooner” art style and thigh highs, those commenters come off as odd people themselves for seeing things like that.. . Finally when it comes to the deviation from the game story, I think it’s a welcome change that not only keeps things fresh but lets the manga stand more on its own as a piece of media. As someone who played the game multiple times, it’s exciting wondering where things will go.
The issue is that the site doesn’t allow non-US folks to pay
THE MANGA IS BEHIND A PAYWALL?? 🤯
Wait till the kids see a book store...
Wait till the kids see it's your cake day
HAPPY CAKE DAY!
r/SuddenlyUltrakill
wrong reply
Good point.
THY CAKE DAY IS NOW
HAPPY HEAVENLY CAKE DAY
>the game is not free. . >the book is also not free. . >WHAAAAAAT???
The manga mischaracterizes them? Explain I didn’t read it
Ah well, idk, choosing the manga as format probably comes with the characters naturally being more expressive, otherwise it would be boring maybe. It’s not necessarily a bad thing
I have no idea what’s with all the hate for the OMORI manga- I’ve played through the game many times and I’ve also been really enjoying the manga. If they kept the manga the exact same as the game it would get kind of boring, changing it up keeps it interesting in my opinion. People need to stfu and just enjoy it honestly
This is the comment section of the new manga chapter release on insta btw
Sorry. the new manga chapter announcement
I think people are missing the point that they called it a “gooner” art style bc people found out the artist drew pretty eyebrow raising content prior to working on the manga. . I could be wrong, and I know people definitely misuse words like gooner and shit, but I think thats where that comment was coming from
Yeah that's what I was thinking too! Like it's definitely misused a lot, but I think it's actually being used here because of the kind of content the artists used to draw of little boys.. . Not the mention, a lot of uh, "little boy" artists do indeed have a lot of stylistic choices in common with each other. It's pretty easy to clock it in once you notice.
yeah, gotta say its a pretty valid reason to be wary of supporting the artist
The Manga is pretty meh tho. Not like it's the end of the world or anything but I get not paying for it. 
Yea i don't like the manga either, but its because of how they changed the story. The story changes and mixing up what happens when, i hate all that stuff they did. I think the art style is fine and the characterization is fine too, they just messed up the story
nah its fine for people to not like the manga, tbh it doesn't really do the story justice and people are allowed to criticism or critique a piece of media. we shouldn't just shower everything with praise by default.
What's so different in the manga than the actual game? The first couple chapters were like the same
tbh im not a fan of the manga for just writing reasons, but i see the appeal
i think 4 dollars for one chapter is a bit much when most physical mangas have like 5-10 chapters and are only 10-13 dollars. at least where i live
They are true about the mangaka, btw
Also a reminder to log out of your Reddit before turning the VPN on, as accessing your account while it is on could result to a sitewide ban.
Really? I've used proton VPN on reddit before and never had a problem.
People have gotten wrongfully banned for doing so before. Better to be safe since Reddit's ban filter is kinda unreliable.
Damn upon reading this I think I have to do it.
I be changing countries every damn minute, still nothing
Thank you so much!!
Back in my day Proton VPN allows you to manually conect to usa, japan, and that one low land country for free now its automatic.. . Still cool free VPN. Been using it for 1 year now very cool!
miss those days 
an old version of Proton VPN from uptodown works perfectly
They say the only truly trustworthy VPN is [Mullvad]() but it costs a little money
opera gx launcher unlimited gb choose "enable vpn" in options set on america and enjoy
[  . [  . here the tutorials
i tried windscribe, by default you get 2GB per month, if you sign up you get 10GB. its also free btw.
I'm connected to the US using windscribe, but it still won't let me enter the site. what about you?
i connected to new york empire, but you can select which ever has the best connection. it works for me, only thing is that the pages might take some time to load.
okay, thank you
Hey so sorry to comment on an old comment but be *very* careful with Windscribe. Free tier users get used as nodes themselves. So if someone does something like, say, commit crypto fraud while using Windscribe and the traffic gets routed through you, the police may very well be at your door.. . Ask me how I know that...
an old version of Proton VPN from uptodown works perfectly
x-vpn is another that works and is free
i downloaded tunnelbear and its still not working :<
have you connected to US?
yee
try using a different browser
its working! thank you!!!
:D
I personally recommend Turbo VPN. Works beautifully on PC tho I'm not quite sure about mobile.
there's some controversy surrounding it. it might be unsafe. 
Damn I really didn't know about this, thanks for pointing it out man
i've gotten proton to connect to the us by using the change server button, still not working.. trying all the vpns i can access rn ahhaha
hey yall, for whoever the k manga site is still region blocked even after ur connected to a US vpn, yall have to use a different browser/device, using a guest account works as well ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|grin). . also a good free vpn that lets u manually connect to the US and several other countries -> planetvpn
None of these VPN or those that I downloaded work…
use a diferent browser

i cant even access tunnelbear, [hide.me](http://hide.me) has a limit and proton has a massive timer for waiting to change servers
I stated these cons in the post already
i meant i cant make an account for tunnelbear
i also used proton and connected to us and japan but didnt work
use a different browser
works on opera gx, tysm
YAY!
An important reminder to exercise caution with free VPNs. Many of them have a clause in their terms that free users are also signing up to be nodes themselves. That means traffic may be routed through your network that you're not expecting, and if that traffic is doing something *unsavoury* it may get linked to you.
All of these are free to use, they do not 'charge more'.
Well, what’s your ISRC?
?
Barcode.
Why would I have a barcode?
Well there is a saying, if it’s free, you’re the product.
wow so funny
Like, actually… none of these vpns are as private as they want you to think
I'm recommending these vpns for connecting to a US server and reading the manga, not for staying private. If you're a Vpn fan and randomly found this post, you've come to the wrong place.
Note: because I don't want to spam, I've made another version that isn't for Open Fortress: [. .

Sweetheart's dress looking like a huge donut!
Sweetheart is the reason I put down the game for 6 months.
I get that King and Queen are just separated but not really divorced. I only just said “divorced” because I was too lazy to find other words to describe it, though the point is that she is similar to Sweetheart in the sense that they’re aren’t really together with their other significant other anymore/at the moment.
Now all we need is a derpy clone, a robotic recreation and an overall better version of Queen and she’ll 100% be “Sweetheart V2”
Thanks. I was thinking that it would have been a nicer idea to let Black Space seep more and more into Headspace the more you progress in time. So for example you would have enemies from black space and/or the abyss suddenly attack you while you're in Sweetheart's castle in a hidden dungeon, or even in the Last Resort.
I also saw Omori vent in the Sweetheart's castle
And the bee. And Sweetheart.
That damn bee will be the death of me. And he already has been once
Sweetheart deserves the hate instead. Wanted to tear the bitch apart every time she was onscreen.
Now this is something I can get behind
Username checks out
A ton of bosses wouldn’t have happened it it weren’t for her
 I agree whole-heartedly with that. Oh and the bee too
The bee??? There was a bee-boss?
Oh and you couldn't skipnits dialogue as well. Its the one that goes s-p-e-l-l-i-n-g b-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Oh right, fuck that guy
Its the spelling bee. The annoying npc that exists to waste time
The bee? What bee?
The s-p-e-l-l-i-n-g b-e-e-e-e-e
The fact that u couldnt skip it either boiled my blood
FINALLY! I get that she’s cute and all but people are really out here simping for a ~~doughnut~~ woman who was mentally and physically abusing her partner!
Yes, but she is funny, so i like her anyway
doughnut :/
Yes omfg I  couldn’t stand her and she’s such a big part of the game for the longest section it felt like
WRONG! Sweetheart is THE BEST character!!!!!!. . >!j!<
I completed her stage fairly quick, so I don't have that issue
Absolute banger of a theme though
Except Sweetheart
Or spelling bee. I fucking hate spelling bee.
a cosplay worth Sweethearts praise!  (all cosplays are cool actually)
Finally, some good Sweetheart art!
Thank you so much!! I'm glad to hear that!
I'm hoping for chris pratt as sweetheart

WHY IS SWEETHEART CRYING-
why is sweetheart crying in her bride dress
Her wedding was propably ruined by some peasants.
[scared sweetheart emoji]
The secret boss, only unlockable in Hikikomori where Sweetheart runs from the Slime Girls and works at Wendy’s
There’s no way she would willingly work for someone else. She’d also get fired the moment a customer asked her for something.
Maybe she’d get slaved into it via contract
Damn you just reminded me of the fact that >!sweetheart fucking died after Humphrey ate her and the slime girls!<
That didn't happen, play the Hikki route
She gets slaved into sweeping
Oops I just assumed that’s what happened, I plan to play it again soon tho
I always guessed that happens since from the keeper of the castle it mentions how sweetheart finds a new home he can talk to him again, and that only works with hikki so something’s different happened
Sweetheart reached the real world disguised as Wendy, be careful.
"Remember, no Sweetheart.". . . 5 Sunny cosplayers attack the Wendy's headquarters with knives.
AND pepperspray.
Be careful? This is the best day of my life!
Sweetheart Wendy: Ohohohoh! Are you approaching me Burger King?
So you must be Sweetheart
I started getting into mods because I needed to undo the >!destruction of SWEETHEART’s castle!<, but upon looking through mods.one I pretty quickly realized there was a plethora of mods to play that all look amazing and may just never run out. So it is worth your time, in my opinion. Personally, I started with AMBIEN, which I would definitely recommend if you enjoyed black space at all, it might be a little tough to figure out but there’s a cheat sheet in the files (though you didn’t hear that from me)! Afterwards, I’d say do the miscellaneous bossfight mods such as BRASIL, the comedy mods such as the google translate mod, and the QOL mods for another playthrough of the base game, in no particular order. After that, I’m not sure. Maybe make your own?
I was trying to get my cousin to play omori. I beat it in a week. He took over 300 hours (I'm not even exaggerating) to get the good ending. He had ~250 hours in by Sweethearts castle
sweethearts castle
As someone else said, "sweetheart taught me to love myself then marry myself," or something like that

sweetheart bodypillow with an hole on her stomach, not just the drawing, the pillow too
mmmmh tofu
Ah yes I need sweetheart body pillow for... uh my personal reasons.
"Don't fuck with us Omori Fans! We WILL cry!". . I did actually manage to avoid major story spoilers, even though I watched my sister play a good portion of it (Up to Sweetheart's castle, but excluding most of the first faraway town section).

The channel Euro Brady is playing it at the moment and commenting on the characters psychology and talking about therapy-stuff in in the context of Omori (Brady's a therapist). There are already 10 parts out and he's not even through Sweethearts castle. Seeing someone with a new view point playing it and reading the comments under it, makes it feel pretty alive to me. Can only highly recommend it.
Love omori but I’m stuck on sweetheart :(
“Looks at sweetheart”. . But it seems that you do
That's really concerning coming from sweetheart..
…
What? Am I not wrong?
Well no…
Wait is sweetheart black canonically
No I don't think so, the popstar she's based off didn't have dark skin in Faraway if I remember correctly
Ahh ok ty
This is incorrect, (maybe) they also found Sweetheart's bed comfy
She about to throw hands with sweetheart
wow, i absolutely ADORE your art style and the way you draw Sweetheart especially <33
T-THANK YOU!! 💞🤧
agreed with them!
Ater taking their food, she’s just going to run away and laugh like an obnoxious person. That reminds me of a meme where a guy went to a supermarket and said that he’d pay for everything that the ppl inside the sm would buy. Then he left.
this is so real it could be omori's spoiler
PFFFFT Yeah honestly XD
BEEN A FAN SINCE 53 SUBS NOTICE ME SWEETHEART
YES PLEASE SWEETHEART MY BELOVED 💖🙌
YOU BETTER NOT BE COMPETITION. . SWEETHEARTS HEART IS MINE. . ..she just doesn’t know it yet . . STILL
Being a Sweetheart simp is a full time job and I’m dedicated 🍩🛐
IM MORE DEDICATED. . I PAYED MY ENTIRE COLLEGE TUTION FOR SEATS TO THE FINALE OF SWEETHEARTS QUEST FOR HEARTS
Hey, it’s the IRS
We’ve got two full-power Sweetheart simps here, what do we do?
JOIN THE FANCLUB
NO
SHUT UP SIMP
AND MY TAXPAYER DOLLARS FOR THOSE TICKETS
You’re going to jail for quite a bit of time. And like, actual jail.
HUH?. . BUT SWEETHEART IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYTHING
Perhaps in your fantasy, but this ain’t fantasy. Or at least some measure of not fantasy.
WELL I DIDNT WANT IT TO END THIS WAY BUT. . currently strapped to my chest is 60 kilos of explosives packed next to shrapnel and broken glass, I have a kill switch that only I can disarm . . . now back the fuck off slowly and I’ll let everyone here live
WOAH FUCK UHHH OK SIR (what do I do oh god oh fuck)
Sweetheart commits cannibalism confirmed.
That's so on character. Nice art btw.
Thank you sm!! ><✨
is she EATING DONUTS? isnt that CANNIBALLISM? LMAO
Well, she’s kind of a Donut-human hybrid, so I don’t think so.
Bullshit. Her pet name isn't Sweet Jelly Filled Donut-Human Hybrid
Well then how do you explain her being humanoid while her parents very clearly look like (mostly) normal donuts?
Genetic variation/mutation. If my parents were normal humans and I was born without any arms or legs, eating humans would still be cannibalism because it's not like I'm a different species all of a sudden.. . Mentioning that her parents are donuts only reinforces the notion that she is donut.
Okay, then she’s the only “Donut” that doesn’t look at all like a donut (aside from the visible hole that goes through her stomach)
Nobody gonna talk about how Sweetheart's a donut and she's eating DONUTS?
I love the artstyle as well
Thank you!!! ✨🥺
how to draw
I THOUGHT IT WAS REAL
HUH??? 😭
YOUR ART IS JUST THAT GOOD
I- HDJDGSGFHDHDK ✨🤧😭
Cannibalism
i love rosscreations
ROCOCO is FURIOUS
He is such a sweetheart !

OHOHO SWEETHEART YOU SAY?. . (Character named Sweetheart that you see later in the story)

Sweetheart exists, nothing spoiled. Nothing was further elaborated upon.
game ruined because sweetheart spoiler  
Yes now the entire game for you is ruined.
Sweetheart doesn't add much if anything to the main plot and I only stated Sweethearts existence
Oh shoot srry
I agree :3


I have been trying to use the emotions system and I’m stuck on sweetheart . . I’ll probably just grind some normal enemies lol
Sweetheart is empty inside because she has a huge hole in her lol
I mean
Actually him not even knowing and assuming that made me think that maybe that's WHY sweetheart is a donut.. To align with the game logic and put that hole in her body, figurative of emptiness, of a hole she needs to fill.
The fact that the video is 1 hour long means that he spent half of the video talking about how empty sweetheart is probably 😭
And you weren't that far off with that statement.
bro was waiting for his sentence in the dungeon to expire
 I forgor…
53 and a half days? Did you commit a crime? Did they lock your arse in the dungeon? What did you do?
The crime was not being the ideal partner for sweetheart, obviously it deserves life in the dungeon

I CAN STILL HEAR HER
Happy Cake Day to you
happy cake day
Happy cake day
happy cake day
happy caek day
happy cake day
happy cake day bro
Happy cake day
happy cake day
The castle was annoying but her boss battle was probably my favorite....then the undersea sisters, that shit was super lit my first time playing it.
Bruh sweet hearts boss was the moment I stopped roasting the game and was like: holy fuck, THIS GAME IS AWESOME.
Why roast the game in the first place?
Not OP but Sweetheart's Castle is a pretty awful area. It's needlessly long with way too much busywork and hit-or-miss quirky comedic moments required to progress the story. It has probably single handedly filtered most new players from experiencing the rest of the game which is phenomenal.. . Seriously, let's take a moment to list it all out.there are 4 different areas in the castle that require you to do pointless tasks like. . - Bake a cake with bad instructions. . - Organize a line of sprout moles in the library. . - Talk to a sprout mole in Sweetheart's room in order to replace a statue. . . - Train a choir of sprout moles by throwing tomatoes at them. . . After you're done with that, that gives you access to a hedge maze outside the castle where you have to talk to 4 more sprout moles to gain a password to access the area where you finally fight Sweetheart and finally progress the story in a meaningful way. . . All these pointless tasks beforehand don't contribute anything to the story, they don't even make sense! Why are we helping prepare for Sweetheart's wedding in the first place when she threw us in the dungeon? These tasks just function as padding so that you gain levels from random encounters for the Sweetheart fight. Like 70% of Sweetheart's Castle should've been cut and Sweetheart herself should've been scaled down to the level you would've been expected to be at that point (though still being a difficult fight, mind you)
I got stuck here last week, and then xbox took the game off its system 😒 so I guess I'm done.
Shouldn't it still be in your xbox library if you bought it..?
Correct. I didn't pay for it. I was going to but it was almost 40 dollars Canadian..
Interesting points but it's it's still fun 
Friend in genshin I frequently grind materials with told me it was deep and never stopped making references to it and played on their suggestion.. . In my first moments I’m introduced to: happy kitty dreamland where the fighting is based on happiness, sadness and anger in a triangle, the “awe and shock” of omori commiting hara kiri and the game having horror segments irl.. . Shit was giving me 14 and deep vibes thinking about the gameplay story telling. (Probably doesn’t help that the Majority of my strategy was killing depressed enemies while angry either)
Use LIFE JAM! It really works!
You killed my friends 💀
He didn’t get much experience off of them 
Damn that burns more then when I fell down a few steps the other day and twisted my ankle
At least it was your ankle
Almost made themselves an OMORI reference.
Really? It really works for e v e r y o n e ?
😭
jam packets
You sure they jam though?

I hate you too 
Let me out of the dungeon please
no.
PLEASE
no.
Oh hey, it’s Sweepheart- I mean Sweetheart OMORI
the one and only
Sweetheart, can I have  some gold?

If you hate it so much why did you spend all that time there? 🧐
The Princess sentenced him to the dungeon, she’s in charge of the land after all, bro must have done a crime
Isn't she the duchess?
Yes
he doesn't have a choice
Are you actually stuck? I can dm you the map of sweetheart’s castle so you don’t get spoiled for anything from the game
Dm me pls
Pls give me the map too
Me too, please? If it's not a hassle. I'm at level 18 and exploring that very area atm.
WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO SERVE 53.5 DAYS IN SWEETHEART'S DUNGEON
Waiting for my sentence to end
Dude please take the maps from online vids or something
FIFTY FIVE DAYS??? DAMN 
Still stuck on the bears
Damn bro, what did you do? 💀
You know, the door in the dungeon cell isnt locked  Sweetheart unfortunatly wont take you out no matter how long you wait...
Wait... youre joking.
No 
Same thing, dude
don't worry I hate you also


WHAT?!
i beg the fuck pardon

Are you seriously saying you don't want to be stepped on by a hot and pink dommy mommy? What a weirdo.
nah wth bros down bad💀☠️

r/cursedcomments
unironically it’s my least favorite part of the game
shortest omori playthrough
Dude was just trying to get "Everyone is a critic"
bro hate that achievement so much, I literally almost threw my switch across the room just trying to get it
What's the achievement for?
you have to sit in the movie theater of her castle and get lucky enough to watch all 13 of the little “movies” . . it’s random so you might have to spend a while trying to get it. I know I sure did
HOW
Are you playing on Switch and left it in standby with the game open?

This gotta be a joke.. I know it's not, which makes me SAD.. (I am playing for the 1st time, and I'm at that exact spot right now. I loooove this game so much already. )
good lord what did they lock you up for? genocide???
I can relate
Homie really thought they had to wait out their jail time fr
The bro just remain in dungeon without evade, cause he is a legal person.
Bro are you fr
If you ever pass it, and you are not planning to make the hikki route, you can turn her castle into your house.. . If you are making a hikki route, get the phobia skills before doing that.
I swear I saw this exact image in another post
I think you mean: OHHOHOHOHOHOHOHO! 
1286 Hours is 53 Days and 14 Hours.
How

lmfao
SAME THING HAPPENWD TO ME GRAGQHQGHG
Me too
WHAT
Nah like the only way that’s possible is you release the bears. Worst mistake of my life.

Couldn't agree more
No joke that's almost my entire playtime if Omori on PC only... 😭. . I don't wanna see your electricity bills :,)
OHOHOHOHOHO 
GAW DAIUM ARE YOU OK???
It took me like an hour with long breaks cause I was on a stream to get out of the dungeon. Wtf are you doing??
it is but a distraction to not let the dreamer "wake up" if you get what i mean


I love it
same…. . the boss fight took me a good 3 weeks
you still watching the show
 50 Days !?
1286 Hours is 53 Days and 14 Hours.
I know I just rounded it
Ok
WHAT LEVEL ARE YOU 😨
they had 2 actually have locked your door or sum ain't no way
1286 Hours is 53 Days and 14 Hours.
You poor soul
tbh littarly the longest most tedious part of the game but atlest it ends with the best battle ost in the game
i LOVE it are you okay how did you spend that long
HOW DOES THIS EVEN HAPPEN
Bro...
Me too kid
Your stuck on that part as well  and I can't even do it anymore because its not on game pass anymore so I can't play it 
literally thought this game was a VN how the frick do you have over 1200 hours
it's an rpg lol
Bro got locked in
Btw if you ARE actually stuck in the dungeon yes they did leave the gate unlocked
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
WHATTT?? How does one manage to spend that amount of time on just sweethearts castle..
Are you okay??? I’m genuinely concerned 
OH HO HO HO HO
based
wait Sweetheart isn't supposed to be that hard. . do you need some help buddy I can give you some tips depending where you are stuck in her castle
just made sweetheart even more attractive 
You... Could've named many other things Sweetheart has that Donuts do nut. . Yet you went with that...
Anything referencing what was mentioned got removed.. . I can see why, but... hmh.. . Anyways, problem's not there anymore.
> image of beach sweetheart. . . . . . . > Half the comments were removed for sexual topics
Some people need to calm down and splash some cold water over their heads I swear
I think it's the anatomy-related topic that got them
Not saying Sweetheart don't look good in that tho...
She is attractive I will give her that (she is a adult so am allowed to say this)
Can sweetheart be pregnant? If so, how would look her belly?
It probably isn't accurate but I imagine the hole just getting filled in
That gives “sweet jelly filled donut” a new meaning. . Inb4 i get banned
So the baby of sweetheart would be the donut's holes, like buns? Maybe I'm overthinking it too much.
Her younger family members are donut holes, so it would make sense for them to be born this way.
Now that you say it, a round hole IS perfect for a donut to appear in it. And then that donut has another donut appear in it's hole... Donut-ception
Holy shit, I wonder the same thing.
Would theoretically it be possible to jump through sweetheart
actually!! it’s about time to go uh.. do some work in my room. thanks for showing me this image of sweetheart!! 
Can’t we just talk about why and HOW Sweetheart can live with a hole in her stomach?!
Sweetheart is spineless.
Why is there a whole in sweetheart
No point in her being separated.
thats Sweetheart, Perfectheart is the one saying "you missed a spot"
Thats really good but i kinda like the sweetheart one (donut house)
["SWEETHEART... She is a goddess walking among us... We are so blessed"]()
Got too excited to see Sweetheart, fucking died
Sweethearts gonna Sweetheart
Stayed in the same seat few days before the Sweetheart concert starts and hasn’t eaten since.
died from excitement from seeing sweetheart
Looks like sweetheart has been filling up seats with her failed contestants.
I’d like to think he died of excitement because of the thought of seeing sweetheart
SweetheartWorld
Sweetheart stole his heart.
I wouldn’t be surprised if it were. Like, if it’s a full adaptation then sweethearts castle is gonna be the worst due to the quest your required to do, and I’m not sure how’d they even do that with a book.
Hopefully a good chunk is just, like, a bunch 4-koma gags that get across they had to do a bunch of nonsense.
Which quest are you referring to?
The ice sculpture one, cake baking one, the library one, and the choir one. I could see the Maximus fights being kinda cool but the quest would be boring.
I didn't know they were mandatory, I just did them on accident, unless I misunderstood you
They are mandatory to progress the area. So I’m hoping they make it shorter or, something like a panel of them doing them.
A Sweetheart is a denizen of Headspace
Tf you goin there?
Donuts
You can even eat one in front of her
imagine her reaction
No need to imagine
If i renember well she has one during her battle
i must try this out,,,. .   . as soon as i get omori cause my parents wont let me have it yet 
Eat the rich
Help me, im stucked at sweetheart Battle, any tips?
no sweetheart 🥲
That's it or sweetheart and mutant heart

I feel like there will be a Mandela affect for some stupid shit. It will be like "did the mole sprouts have 1 leaf or 2 leaves?". . Or "Did sweetheart say HOHOHOHO or OHOHOHOH"
w-wait, wait... how many leaves *did* they have
Shit
lmao who’s this weird black thing in my bedr-
**I know now what must be done.**
Most of them have 2 leaves. Also it’s OHOHO
Your telling me it isn’t fucking HOHOHO?? 
She's sweetheart not Santa
50 USD for Blackspace content, or grind to Level 50 in Sweetheart's dungeon
THE SWEETHEART BODY PILLOW IS CANON!!!
sweetheart is the type of person to cough in other people's faces while she's sick to spread it 

Sweetheart is the type of person who looks cute next to sakura trees
She's perfect as a hateable character. You're not supposed to like and her and she does a very good job
I do like her though
Ur the type of person to defend Vriska
wow u didn't have to go that hard
Who’s Vriska?
Find out on your own time; not enough time to explain
Could you send a private message to me giving the description, at least?
She is the reason why we have Mutantheart, Perfectheart and Roboheart
Mutantheart my beloved
🙏
Based
Based on what?
On facts and logic
what about swethort :(. . she's pafect!!!
Idek who those guys are 😭 i never encountered them
If you haven’t finished the game then you probably shouldn’t look at this subreddit until you are, because it’s full of spoilers.
they are optional enemies, though.
how can i find them?
You can find Roboheart in the last room in the “hard” puzzle room. She can be fought regardless of what route you are doing. Mutantheart and Perfectheart can only be fought on the Omori route
Oh dam cant believe i missed them
They may be optional enemies, but they are characters that the player sees even if they only follow the main story
i only followed the main story yet i never saw them
I beat the game on the good ending idk when we fight those guys tho
Ah okay
Are they in the bad ending
Genuinely the best boss fight in the game from a gameplay perspective coupled with a banger theme and you got a memorable fight.. .  >!Narrativly the best is against Omori!<
And she’s so powerful she breaks the fourth wall and makes you, the player, feel ANGRY.
so true
Best? More like the most frustrating.
Also, sweetheart lives in a castle that can be claimed by Omori and turn it into his home.. . So, yeah, Sweetheart lives in something that Omori can call home.
She’s hot
Couldn't have said it better
She's a donut
Your pfp fits your comment perfectly
A sweet jelly filled donut
Her bossfight is fun
Her design . I'm low-key obsessed with it
Same
Bodypillow
she's pink and has no other redeeming qualities 
Pink? Gross 
I don't even like that color that much, so she has no redeeming qualities to me.
OHOHOHOHO!
OHOHOHOHOHO!!!
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!!


She has a nice dress
Twintails and floofy dress
She’s hot and I have the fattest gay crush on her
She has 5 holes
Why did I see this coming?
😈🥺👉👈😣
I mean I’m not denying I wouldn’t do it

Same
Always thought it was neat how she's the driving force for almost every crucial moment in the Headspace plot. We fight Captain Spaceboy (twice), the Slime Girls, Humphrey, and the Sweetheart clones all because of her actions.. . Even minor fights like Download Window, King Crawler, and Sir Maximus I II III, are indirectly because of her.
The portrait of sweetheart devouring her son made me laugh my ass off
CONTEXT: in sweethearts castle there's a wall with a bunch of sweetheart renditions of paintings, and if you look hard enough there's a sweetheart version of the painting "Saturn devouring his son"
"Sweetheart eating a burrito" had me wheezing
Her ex husband
The boss theme is a bob
She has a pulchritudinous face 
Banger osts in her castle
Her boss theme slaps
r/sweetheartfanclub GATHER
She makes me laugh because she is ridiculous.. . And she has the best boss theme in the game
She was comedic relief
Many other people here have said some pretty deep stuff about her character, but I’m just gonna throw it out there that I love her design.
I love her take on the “magical girl but mean” design concept
Her design
her bossfight was the most fun I've had in the game so far. It made me HAPPY instead of ANGRY lmao
She has GREAT fashion sense.
Probably the most poignant fight in the base game in terms of using the Emotion mechanic to add to the flavor of a boss fight.
She has a nice dress
She is the most human looking donut I’ve ever seen.
She is the definition of a character you love to hate. She's self-absorbed to unhealthy lengths and never changes her ways, but she's also hilarious. You hate her, but every time she's on the screen you're having the time of your life.
I have never played omori but she looks like mad mew mew
Get off this sub, there are tons of spoilers.
Ayo? 🤨📸
What? She's a donut!. . >!Wait, does this mean she bleeds yelly? God damn I'm about to become a vampire here!<
Where you thinking the same thing?
She's holy
World's End Valentine and Tee-hee Time
her character design is really pretty honestly
Pretty woman who's armed and ready 😳🥺😳🥺😳🥺😳
Booba
She’s pink (not a gross color)
Soundtrack
Her theme fucking slaps
I like her design. Compared to the other bosses she’s my favorite even though her boss fight was infuriating
Sweetheart is a fantastic villian, she’s awesome
She's one of the few video game character i know to love herself (even tho she does a bit too much)
She seems like she would smell nice. I mean she is literally a donut so I would hope so
Hot
she's pink
Pretty woman
She is a good actress
Pink
**The World's End Valentine noises**
donut👍
She's good with self-love, I guess?
she is very good at being an asshole
HO HO HO HO

her theme slaps
She got a good theme tho
She matches rengoku
Ok irrelevant but her mouth is too big and it makes me uncomfortable. I know it's suppose to be like a posh laugh but ...  Jesus
Cool hair
i’m literally her
Easy. Her theme. Worlds End Valentine is the greatest boss theme in Omori. 
She’s tasty 
she is . . 1pretty. . 2hot. . 3amazing character. . 4toxic(i like toxic women)   . . 5 gorgeous . . 6.a villain (love villains). . 7.she made mutantheart perfectheart and roboheart. . 8.self centered(love those too). . 9.mentally ill(i love those too) . .

​
Where are the sacred texts?
I’m only capable of doing what a normal person can, buddy.
tell me one bad thing about her
she ahs a FRYING PAN, BODY FOLLOW, AND TEACUP in her castle, witch are verry usefull
the only reason sweetheart's castle is not optional is bc the devs liked world's end valentine so much apparently and it is a good song
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
ohohohohohohoho
Her theme slaps.
She is, pin k
>!She's a donut, so it must taste delicious... too bad you have to chop it into portions to make it easier to eat.!<. . &#x200B;. . Besides that she is the origin of Robotheart, Perfectheart and Mutantheart, and who want it or not they are better than the original version.
She taste good
shes pretty, she is a great villain, shes funny and her boss theme is a banger. in short, i love sweetheart
Absolutely everything, she’s perfect.
She's a donut, so you can eat her if times get tough.
Her ost

Her battle theme slaps
She’s cute and so are mutantheart, Roboheart and perfectheart which were made thanks to her
She has a beautiful design
She only became like who she is now due to her persistence, also it’s fun to hate her
Jojo part 3 reference
Her laugh isn't as ear piercing and annoying on the 2nd playthrough to me.
You mean besides worlds end valentine? She has a hell of a lot of self love
She has somewhat high stats.
She's edible
Her theme is absolutely based
Its pink
At least she has a great taste in fashion…
She has good taste in clothes.
Worlds end valentine slaps HARD
She is determined. Very determined. And so she tried to get stuff done. Also she knows what she wants!  . . . Doesn't keep myself away from hating her doe!
she dies (i think)

OHOHOHOHOHOHOHO

the other characters cant be the worst anymore
She's a donut
Has funni laugh
She is proof that perfection isn't real, at least not the perfection Sweetheart and other entitled fools believe exists.
Her face, her attitude, her lines, her laugh, her smile, her accessories, her bow, the fact that she’s a donut, her shades of pink, she’s a girlboss, she was ready to get married to herself, she has statues of herself around her massive castle garden, her theme is catchy, she stole my heart. OHOHOHOHOHOHOH
My girlfriend says shes pink
She cute.
Donuts taste good
uh shes hawt 
She is a donut, very good meal *nyak nyak*

Thanks for watching!
She isn't on playstation yet 🙃
she is a donat actually so you can eat her
She loves herself. That's a bit rare nowadays. From what I've seen anyway.
She is so absurd that it’s funny. She never fails to make me laugh.
I would smash her
The ost
Her character gets a bachelor's degree from the university of Being A Bitchology
Banger theme
she can probably say the n-word
Uh...her looks if ykkk
she has the most pulchritudinous face duh
The fact that she’s hated means the creators of her character did a fantastic job.
She’s got a pretty pink dress that I would love to wear..uh…
I think she’s a very funny character, humour is subjective and all but pretty much all of her jokes landed for me
She's cute but annoying.
She's hot
her bosstheme slAPS
You can kick her ass
She is apparently a dount
her boss theme is a banger
her design is pretty
"OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO~!!!"
She is the boss that told me that I actually need to start planning instead of spamming enraged attacks so I am grateful for her
She’s pretty and I love her
Donut
She's fuhny
Her weapon matching her style.
She can’t basically instant kill you >! *cough cough* perfectheart *cough* !<
Her design is pretty cool ig
Banging theme
She’s not real, therefore she can’t hurt us
her aesthetic is something i strive to achieve every single day of my life  . the pink hair. the fancy pink dress. the fucking *heart shaped morning star*
and what about you, oh boten? do you understand my feelings? why is it that you always seem to eagerly await for someone to comment, only so you can repeatedly mutter the same meaningless words?  . do you wish to *truly* speak to us, boten? do you love us? do you hate us? are you in despair, boten?  . your actions are as predictable as one could be, and yet, our love for you is deep and unconditional, like that between a joyful mother and her newborn child.  . but will such love last? what if we get tired of you eventually, and throw you and your feelings away like worthless garbage? does the thought of being abandoned in the future scare you, boten? is that what you keep trying to tell us?  . if you found your own true voice, would we still care for you?
She has a very cool character design
cool design idfk

Her battle theme goes hard
She’s pretty
Her theme slaps hard.
she pretty and she have cool weapon
she has an absolute banger of an OST
the mace things cool tbh
Rule
she's pretty. she's a good singer. she's rich (sugar momma). it's been a while since i've seen omori so if i went back i'm sure i could make a bigger list.. .  she really was just narcissistic and wanted to be loved because she has a fear of being alone. thats why she was constantly searching for love. she doesn't really know how to treat people as eqivalents because she was never taught it's a sterotype for most rich girl narssisitic pop stars. she really just has one eh maybe two big issues that can be divided into smaller more specific things if you really analyze her character. these two big issues are her weak pointa her insecurities, so if you play your cards right you can easily take advantage of her. psychology; it's what makes people tick!. . i think sweetheart just needs a good therapist amd maybe a friend or two to start out.
she is a donut. 😊
The theme
Her laugh is wonderful 
She's pretty
She got a lot of boss battles
Boss theme

She's cute
Nothing, fucking nothing damnit, I can't get past her

She's pink
The ost,maybe my favorit
The ost for her especially her battle theme.
She has a Perfect partner
her teachnical sisters and her laugh
There is a bodypillow case with her in it

Her battle theme
She's a really sweet girl. Literally.
Bodypillow,

ohohohoho
she dresses how I wish I had the guts to dress
Characters that are evil just for the sake of being evil? So valid
she's hot
Her laugh
She was very fun to voice when I streamed Omori
My hatred of her just shows how well she was written. Good job!
she's pretty
The boss theme

She's pink.
Her bossfight theme nothing more
Shes a donut
She has great hair.. . That doesn't mean I absolutely can't STAND her ridiculous laughter tho 
Her theme.
She's sweet & edible.. . Someone get the toaster.
She is delicious
Me voice acting her in a posh British accent,  was fun as heck
Her battle theme SLAPS
She's a doughnut
Ost
She keeps mole sprout unemployment rates down.

She has one of the best themes in the entire game.. . Top 5 out of the entire soundtrack imo

has the one of the best boss themes
She’s hot
worlds end valentine
Drip and good theme
Her outfits
Nothing. She wanted to marry a child. I’ll forever hate her
Add sweetheart
I wanted SWEETHEART
Sweetheart isn’t actually best girl.
Cold take: Sweetheart is a donut.. This is all but confirmed in game.
here is one that I know of.  Even if you choose to delete sweethearts castle in black space it'll still be there
Hmmm… can you elaborate on what you mean by this?
So like I just saw it on a vid. But in sweetheart castle there is a garden underground that connects to the black space somehow and you can see pure black of a space from there and from black space you can see moles chilling. But when you interact with the castles owner and delete the castle, you can still see it from black space
Ah now I understand :) this area has a secret entrance from sweethearts side so it does seem really weird… I could assume that they’re separate places with how black space 2 likes to “disguise” locations with white space characteristics, but it certainly is weird :)
[ This?
Yeah!
Thought Sweetheart would be the only one to try that?
Vote out sweetheart again, remove her from the image
noo what happened to sweetheart
I have to say Space BF is least fav on this one. I love him... but Sweetheart, jaswum, and Jar asshat are all already gone. And I can't put him above no one else
sweetheart bc she’s a nonce
Como va a perder sweetheart, como es posible banda
all of y’all who voted sweetheart . i will personally hunt each one of you down
okay but does lisa the painful have sweetheart??. . checkmate
[Yes actually]()
i was wrong
ohhh forgot about that guy. . i just always called him "big man" so that's probably why
finally the wicked bitch is dead
it has this one trans girl who is the exact same as sweetheart but more badass so yeah
Okay now sweetheart having it makes no sense
The reference to I Want Nothing More (Sweetheart mixtape) in You Cannot Go Back
^^^^
I forgot about that. Man Sweetheart sucks
...so is Sweetheart? What's your point?
They can't grow up or learn anything cause they're fictional characters made by a kid who haven't grown and moved on from his problems himself
Uh  . They're all fictional characters.  . This is a video game.
Can we throw Rosa and Sweetheart into a room and then light that room on fire?
I’ll get the gasoline
Alright, I'll get them in the room
Don’t forget the lighter!!
Ah, thanks. I almost forgot.
SACRIFICE!
Sack of rice! 
 I offer my help!
 Cultist Couple
For the Great Old Ones! 
non Euclidean geometry time
Ah yes, the most eldritch of horrors: high school level math
Lovecraft was fuckijg horrified of that. Granted he was fuckijg horrified of everything so
NO
Nah man. All three of the sweetheart clones with the captain.
People really be looking at how abusive sweetheart was to him and say “yeah, let’s ship that.”
And I bet they would also call sunflower toxic too, while ignoring the toxicity of shipping sweetheart with space boy.
tbh all ships in Omori are kinda toxic in some way
That's true, all of them can be in particular situations, but it all depends on how the situation works, any can go either way. I mainly meant in the gatekeeing way.
Me x Sweetheart better
Yeah💪 sweetheart should've been with me not space bf💔🙁
Me x Sweetheart is better ngl
i will not stand for this anti-sweetheart  propaganda!
As a fellow Sweetheart fan,. . they're right.
That's not how toxic relationships work. People get super codependent on people like Sweetheart, who broke down his psyche to the point he got severely depressed when alone and literally tortured him and ruined the things he loved. It is incredibly common for people to return to their abusers for a number of reasons.. . . . 
Jesus Christ!
fuck sweetheart, all my homies hate sweetheart
[FUCK SWEETHEART ALL MY HOMIES HATE SWEETHEART](). . ^^^this ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^bot
Suggestion to put X's or use bright red for the crossed out characters. I spent far too long searching for Sweetheart in the poll
Idk! But, i **would** love to see more if her. Mostly because i love the aesthetic of sweetheart's mansion and her "crazy mean bitch princess" personality
She’s a character you love to loathe, and thats what makes her enjoyable to me
 Banger theme princess Sweetheart 👑
Level 2:. . Capitalism
Shark man
Hey
Omg Uber oni rogue lineage
What
Who is it? The guy that reforms Sweetheart's castle?
nah, he's in black space 2
Then who is it goddammit?
i meant that the character is in black space 2, not the keeper of the castle. . the character is >!omoli!<
Is it the guy that makes art in sweethearts castle?
Is it the face stuck on the soil that you can see on the forest near Sweetheart's castle and Orange Oasis?
Not quite. They are related to Sweetheart though.
The artist in her castle?
Yup! Rococo, the Painter (and Sweetheart’s ex).
Oh okay
🗿Sweetheart
No
Lemme just leave the entire female cast here then
Hint: Girls
Slime gurls
Yes 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
FINALLY
Sweetheart then
Gotta think sad
Sweetheart
Nope, I was thinking someone from a different game, and is male.
Lmao okay, the Joker?
Nope, a different game, he is a bit "Handsome", if that makes it easier.
I....am clueless i'm sorry lol
Don't be, uts Handsom Jack from the Borderlands series.
Oohhh i feel dumb now lol, gg
Sweetheart? 🗿
Nada - Its Snaley.
Oh right, gg
That one artist in Sweetheart castle
Sweetheart?
tip: >!it is big!<
Boss?
Sweetheart
Wrong, she's the FIRST most annoying one. . But not to worry, you aren't too far off the mark
Nop, sorry. It's Rosa, the #1 Sweetheart fan!
Oh yeah. her. Good thinking lol
Ah nah, Sweetheart. Better luck next time!
Arg i hesitated, gg tho lol
Sweetheart?
 Looks funny
Tofu and Sweetheart.
?
The ones who love those.
Oohhhh. That one Sprout Mole who sent a letter to Sweetheart
Yep.
Candle Bunny from Sweetheart's castle
Nope
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
No
Here before this gets 1984'd.. . . EDIT: I think SUNNY's into it. Besides the Slime Girls, there's two relationships (that I can recall) in HEADSPACE and both of them show the woman as the dominant one.. . . [MARI teases HERO]() more than once.. . . CAPT. SPACEBOY was [immobilised]() after [SWEETHEART left him.]() After he was woken up, he (temporarily) swore vengeance against her. He admits that it's ["almost impossible for [him] to imagine life apart from her".]() Even so, he [returned to SWEETHEART and married her.]()
Sweetheart.. . They are talking about Sweetheart.. . lmao
sweetheart 16 year old arc 
Uh oh... Head empty...
Every calcium deposit in my body despises sweetheart
OMFG Sweetheart as well!!!. . I bought all her limited edition merch last year!!! Including the daki, keychain, hoodie etc. I'm sad because the quality wasn't the best but I still wear the hoodie all the time AAA also my cat loves her.. . She just is amazing, she doesn't need anyone else but her and she's brave enough to admit that and her self confidence and giant ego is so cute!!!. . Also she's godamn pink!!!! That's like my colour!! I have pink mic, pink keyboard, pink mouse, pink heater, pink mousemat etc you get the point!!. . So like her entire existence is a blessing and I love her omggg
I didn't know she had limited time merch
aubbey.. also sweetheart is a jerk but i love her vibe shes gender
Agreed, sweetheart is so bbgirl
SWEETHEART BEST GIRL
Sweetheart 
its so funny seeing new omori fans discover sweetheart body pillow
I was so confused when I first found out 
me too lol
Sweetheart\*
Basil and Sweetheart can *both* be superior beings :3 Basil gets the headpats \~! And Sweetheart gets the cuddles ~~and undying servitude so she steps on me~~\~!
Yay 
Isn't that Sweetheart's?
Can someone please tell me where to find this? I’m in the middle of my second play-through and  have seen so many posts of this. Ik it’s somewhere on sweethearts castle but that’s it.
When I pulled that lever, I also pulled my socks up, drank boomer juice, slapped myself in the face and played Super Gore Nest, because shit just got real.. . I fought Sweetheart overleveled after that, the fight was really easy.
oh my god this gave me horrible flashbacks. this happened to me as well, except i had stupidly not saved for at least 3-4 hours of gameplay. i was low on supplies and health after just beating sir maximus, so i literally could not beat these damn bears. do not ask me why i did not save at all during the entirety of the sweetheart castle portion, even i couldn’t tell you. i wish you the best of luck
Yeah, the opposite side on the Sweetheart Body Pillow
“I came looking for copper and I found gold”
real
Be warned that is goes in same package with Sweetheart body pillow.
Eh, I'll take it. Sweetheart is hot, even though her personality is awful. Besides, it's just a body pillow
no sweetheart plush 
There is actually a sweetheart doll, its very hard to find though. So that ones’ my favorite
Sweetheart gang 


OHOHOHOHOHOHOHO





I just realised that all sweetheart gang members have either THE MAVERICK or sweetheart  as thier flair
Yessir
It seems greatly minds think alike. . . . . . THE MAVERICK AND SWEETHEART SUPREMACY
all of them, except sweetheart

none of them, except sweetheart
All of them . (Except sweetheart)
SWEETHEART!!! and rosa
Ah, to be in Sweetheart’s castle again. This was a tad annoying to deal with, but it wasn’t too hard when it came to fending them off. Your bigger challenge is survival.
Kill them.. . Use the Sweetheart Strategy (make yourself HAPPY) and punch them like Saxton Hale in the Amazon Rainforests. Or you can >!make them SAD to!< hamstring their attacks (>!RARE BEARS gain an additional ATTACK buff beyond the usual +30% ANGRY bonus - without this they're not all that dangerous!<). The former grants more EXP and is what I did.. . (To be fair >!I also beat the shit out of KING CARNIVORE before initiating the Game Show cutscene so!< I was significantly overleveled )
I thought Sweetheart was Candice, the woman from the candy store.
She is, as well as the in-universe Sweetheart series.. . While Mari might've been a perfectionist, she wouldn't be anywhere close to what Sweetheart was (who openly saw herself as perfect, the opposite of what a perfectionist would see themselves as). It is an interesting thought, >!but if that was the case then Sweetheart would be in the deepest part of Black Space for being part of the cause of The Truth.!<. . If anything, Sweetheart was made to be a direct contrast of Mari in every way. For example, Sweetheart pays the tolls on her way to Humphrey while mocking you. If you also pay the tolls, Mari will give you some clams in return.
To support your statement, I’d like to point out that Sweetheart castle’s theme is one of the few Waltzes present in the game. The other waltz themes are closely related to Mari. So Sweetheart is related to her. The extremely annoying and perfect theme is related to her.
…and then you have the Sweetheart bikini photo…
*oh no*


I think Sunny didn't see Sweetheart as literally just Mari, I think Sweetheart was still her own person for Sunny, he couldn't associate her with Mari so all the Sweetheart counterparts are just Sweetheart counterparts
Wish we could have explore the flawed parts of her in the game, since all we mostly saw was the perfected version of her in HS. She is like the embodiment of a "perfect" older sister and a sweetheart
Sweetheart?
17 (bonus) will be "Sweethearts AWESOME SWEET ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Not including Omori, Basil, Mari, Kel, or Hero.)" (Sweetheart's demanded album)
Yes
Yeah like the random times always got me. My favorite is probably >!The one at sweethearts castle. I did it a couple times cause i was like huh and then it popped up and i like shit myself!<
>!Am I the only one who was expecting a Something to show up during one of the telescope screens? It's quiet, you have minimal vision that's slow and difficult to move... perfect time to sneak something scary in there!<
>!oh yeah i was literally scanning the whole area with the telescope looking for something, not even just Something but like anything. That and the end of the highway too. Like i so expected something there!<
It's one of those WTF value exclusive occurrences iirc
There is a something on the lighthouse telescope, though there's a chance it won't be there.
The amount of time I had to spend on sweetheart the first playthrough.
Ok I’m not that far into the game, attempted sweetheart for the first time yesterday, but that spider sequence was terrible. I legit remember having headphones on and I went into the house to just those noises. I legit threw my headphones off and had to play the entire segment with no sound because I don’t want no mf sounds of spiders crawling directly next to my ears

A Sweetheart
Perfectheart and Sweetheart. The idea of a malevolent and lonely pink girl who is all powerful and abuses her subjects, is an idea I had before. You can see it in my profile pic. Guess pink is the evil color now?
I learned about it through a friend on Discord. After hearing Sweetheart's theme, and not wanting to spoil myself any further (plus, I considered it for a while) I asked my dad to get the game for me, and he agreed, so I finished it now (good and bad ending, currently doing the Hikkikomori route that I also call the Madotsuki route)
Sweetheart 
Sweetheart
You love sweetheart as a character?
She has an interesting character and is somehow the cause of almost every problem in HEADSPACE, so no SWEETHEART = uninteresting HEADSPACE.. . I hate the things she does but as a character she's very well made imo.
Jawsum is like the only character that has zero sweetheart influence, so headspace would be uninteresting except for capitalism
Also the unbread twins and orange oasis as a whole, but thats optional.
you dont?
No! She’s a vain asshole obsessed with a concept she doesn’t even understand!
That's literally the reason I adore her...
What is positive or adorable about one who is terribly vain, uncaring of others, and chases after a fleeting false ideal of love?
Just because you like a fictional character, it doesn't mean you think they're a good person. . . There is a massive difference between good person and good character.
You literally just described a baby/younger child. Babies are, sorry people, rude, dumb and can straight up be cruel at times. That doesn't mean that's who they are. They are just some innocent dumbfucks that still have a lot to learn.. . Most of Sweetheart's actions come from her lack of understanding of Love. Like you said, she's obsessed with it and always makes everything around her about love, though I feel like that's just her trying to put on a facade while desperately wishing to know what it is (at least in my interpretation anyways, I also think she represents Sunny's hunger for love). There's no excuse for what she did but I can kind of understand the reason behind it.. . As a character, she is incredibly entertaining though I know for sure I would try my best to avoid her as far as possible the moment I saw her irl.
You make a good point
that's kind of the point of this post, she would be a bitch irl, but she's funny and well written. I feel the same away about a CERTAIN character named odalia, I love to hate them.
Oh, you make a good point, my bad
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart or Aubrey.. . Sweetheart because… ***she’s mfing SWEETHEART***. . Aubrey because I don’t have the spine to genuinely commit to something, nor am I that fun to be around…
Sweetheart
Sweetheart. I find her antics funny, but she would be insufferable as a person, as the Slime Girls and Omori’s friend can attest.
Sweetheart my beloved
sweetheart shes made for that
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
Probably have a love hate relationship with sweetheart because of the things she did but I absolutely love her ojou sama personality/spoiled rich princess personality I absolutely love her design and personality that's why I love her as a character :)
Sweetheart no doubt.. I'd love to hang out with Kel, he's the right amount of annoying unlike Sweetheart, if that makes sense
Sweetheart is a fantastic villain and I love her for it. . If she was real I'd backhand her
My princess Sweetheart 💘. I couldn’t stand her in real life but I love her in the game
Sweetheart.. I just love her as a character, she has a big personality, a solid backstory and she's an amazing and iconic villain, but for pretty obvious reasons, I would absolutely *hate* her irl.
sweetheart
Lol someone couldn’t make it past sweetheart
I think you mean Boss.
 I HAVE THE SWEETHEART BODY PILLOW
I'm gonna burn that cursed pillow!
: TRY TO I DARE YOU. IT’S LIKE SETTING A BRICK ON FIRE.
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|trollface)\*Flamethrower ready and doing the Pyro pose from tf2\*
It survives
Dammit!
: Sweetheart is indestructible.
: uuuggghhh is no fair!, How is it possible that you sleep hugging that thing instead of me!? (it came out accidentally xd).. . : Cuz bodypillow, also you left me alone in my house for 4 years so i needed some company.
: Oh.
: Well... I'll forgive you that mistake if you join me for at least one night... you'd be like another Bodypillow but alive and warm, do you think it's OK?.
: A what?
: \*siiiiigh\* ok i correct myself... do you want to spend at least one night with me like in the old days when we had sleepovers?, don't worry I'm so quiet sleeping that one would think I died (kidding).
: Sure I guess.
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|smile): Good
I think it’s a photo that you can pick up in sweethearts parents house. (I’m not entirely sure!)
And pessi's thing too if you check it
Can confirm that it's in the Donut house in Orange Oasis. You can't really take the photo with you but you can at least look at it and then put it back down.
"Oh food goes right through me."-Sweetheart probably
happy cake day
Aww thanks
I think I found this before meeting sweetheart and thought nothing of it. It was hoping she'd be a nice successful pretty girl that her parents were proud of. Then later I felt bad for them.
Yes! You find it in Sweetheart's parents house..!
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO SWEETHEART MY HABIBI AIKSIKDOKDUNFIK
Sweethearts lowkey my favourite from Dream world
Wait hold on. The background is obviously fake but it depicts the real world sky, not the sky from Headspace. It was sewn to be that of the real world's sky and not the sky that most denizens of Headspace see everyday. So...either Sweetheart, for whatever reason, know about the real world, or did the person who sewn that background know about it?
Nope! Although thank God, because Sweetheart pisses me off.
Angry with the twins, sad with sweetheart, happy with everyone else
I used angry on enimies, and happy on the team. Pretty much the only exceptions were >!Sweetheart!< and the >!Bread twins.!<
Sad was the only thing that got me through Sweetheart lmao
Angry for raw damage. Neutral for tanking. Happy and Sad are highly situational. Happy has some more good combos and is good for later in the battle when you want to switch the enemy to angry for that sweet sweet XP. Sad is pretty much only for Omori’s combos, fighting underleveled and fights with Happy Bosses (Sweetheart)
I used angry, save for Sweetheart. Happy always backfired on me, always making me miss.
I read that in sweethearts voice 
I have your social security number 
Sweetheart
sweetheart
Sweetheart ?
are you sweetheart?
I'll go with Sweetheart
obviously it's Sweetheart. i'd recognise her pulchritudinous face anywhere
sweetheart
Sweetheart, obviously Sweatheart, OH-OH-OH !!!
Probably Sweetheart
Damn we get identification charts before a sweetheart plushie 😭😭😭 💀💀💀
Sweetheart, duh
has to be the very bottom left corner of sweetheart’s sprite
Guys, we found Sweetheart reddit account
Sweetheart him
r/foundthesweetheart
I wonder if this is how sweetheart would cope with rejection
“I miss my sister, Sweetheart. I miss her a lot.”
"I'll be back."
I can imagine Sweetheart just said something like “Wh.. what the hell ARE you!?”
\-sweetheart
(about to lock him in the dungeons)
Cuz of sweetheart
Sweetheart castle 
nah istg if half of it is sweethearts castle im gonna crash out it wasn't fun in the game and it STILL won't be fun now i guarantee it
I just want to see Sweetheart
ok ok hold on  . ive seen many, many cosplayers on this subredit  . BUT THIS IS AWSOME  . THE FREAKING UI AND ALL  . NOT TO MENTION THE GREAT COSTUME  . thats some good cosplaying right there
This is one of those compliments that are meant in good faith, but is actually quite rude. . . All of the cosplays on this subreddit are awesome.
 Jealous?
How tf is this rude?
They essentially said “there’s a lot of mediocre cosplays on this sub, but this one is easily the best!”
Oh piss off. . What a twat
Sure. You’re blocked.
That’s awesome
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>!OHOHOHOOHOHHHOHOHOOHOHOHOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO!!!!!!!!!!!<
>!Huh, I thought someone called me, oh wait, I don't have ears, yohohohoh!<
>!everything is a spoiler now!<
>!I am inside your walls!<
This is so cool! Hope you had a good time there! 
YOOO! ITS DEFINITELY THE UI FOR ME! YOU LOOK AMAZING! IMAGINE THE TIME YOU PUT INTO MAKING ALL OF THAT! THIS IS PEAK COSPLAYING! 
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! 
aaaah this is so cool!!
I can hear World's end Valentine on my head by just looking at this!!! 
That is pure insanity /pos
WOOO
Woah. . 
that's so cool wtf
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH!!!!
I cannot even begin to imagine the time, patience and dedication! Love it 
I expected ui. Also half expected to see sweetheart go ultra instinct
Oh my flipping cod, this is the most insane cosplay I've ever seen.. . And I love it.
This is WAY too cool for this sub at this point we should just open a sub for super high quality cosplays like this. . (Jokes aside this is the best cosplay i've seen on this sub)
AWWWW THIS LOOKS GREAT :D
She has the most pulchritudiounsous face
OHOHOHOHO!
This fucking RULES
AUBEY 
Gotta use rain clouds
Holy shit I love this
Creative
that’s actually so creative
Woah! That's AWESOME! 
Nah man that’s too cool
this is actually insane i love it 
Perfect.
Well, the quality's basically amazing.. . Great work.
That’s actually so fire
Ok ngl, i thought the ui was literally attached to your costume at first. . Great cosplay btw!
That's a super cool cosplay! I love the bow and the hair specifically (insert recently-removed Sweetheart laughing emoji here)

Totally agree! The best part is the sheer arrogance and confidence tho. Befitting of Sweetheart.
Also, from one disabled cosplayer to another, I love to see your wheelchair in the picture!
Nice cosplay. All you're missing is a giant heart flail.
Is that what it's called?!
Yes. A flail is a weapon with an heavy object (often spiked) attached to a handle by a chain/rope
Ohhh I thought she had a bludgeon mb
it is
Damn
I will not make a stairs joke. . I will instead politely ask what condition this is. . And say, this looks cool
It’s okay. I actually have two that kinda go together; Multiple Sclerosis and Transverse Myelitis
Darn... At least you're still making the best of your life. Seriously, this cosplay is really good. Keep it up!
Thank u so much!
dude that quality i. . i want to touch this wig omg
YOOOO
OH NO SHE'S LOOSE! SUNNY WHAT HAVE YOU DONE YOU RELEASED SWEETHEART INTO OUR WORLD! WHY DO I HEAR A ARMY-  (insert trampled by army of sprout moles noises)
I just got off instagram and the difference of the comments in the social medias is scary
I’ll be honest, I’ve never noticed it on my own social media. I don’t doubt it’s different for others or just generally though
I'm sorry. But you are arrested for being so adorable and pretty.
Oh no! Sweetheart has materialized into the real world!
YOU ARE SO PERFECT. ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTUL AND STUNNING, MY HEART MY DARLING 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵
LOVE YOU!!!! 💖💖💖
LOVE YOU TOO!!!!!!!!
Oh my god the colors are so cute!! I love that shade of pink, and then your wheelchair matching the Sweetheart palette is so cute!!
PRETTY!!!! Have u considered acc dying ur hair pink cuz i think itd be so cute !! Maybe im just projecting cuz i too want pink hair lol (/ω＼)
I would love pink hair but the upkeep of it… no thank u. I’ll just stick to wigs lol
SWEETHEART MENTIONED!! I love your cosplay!!
Cute!
Your cosplay is so pretty!! Keep up the good work <3
SUCH PEAK!
this is so pretty!!! i am obsessed w that wig omg. also, your color matching is on POINT
Athenene! You ate again with your cosplay : D
One of the most beautiful cosplays I've seen for her!! It's gorgeous
OMG I KEEP SEEING YOU EVERYWHERE FIRST NENE THEN MIZI NOW SWEETHEART?!?!?!? SLAYED YET AGAIN!!!!
Ohohohohoh!
Ah yes, my favorite lord princess ohohohoho. . 
U look amazing sweetheart :0
Don’t get me wrong, love the cosplay.. . . But I can’t stop laughing after imagining Sweetheart being bound to a wheelchair after getting her ass beat by the dream team. 😭
YO CANON SWEETHERT IN A WHEELCHAIR??!?!1
Why the fuck am i laughing
Slay
The pose is ON POINT
Pink suits you very well :D
this is beautiful! you did such a great job!
You look badass, that's an excellent cosplay!  Thanks for sharing it with us 🙂
1000/10!!
QUEEN (literally)
Great cosplay! All you need is a heart flail and a few voice impression attempts.
HOW CUTE, I actually thought the outfit looked like it would suit you outside of cosplay, even though I've only seen your cosplay photo lol. The cosplay is really good, you look beautiful!!
Love the creativity in this cosplay, well done!
IDK IF I COMMENTED HERE YET BUT SO CUTE LOVE IT!!
Cool!! OHOHOHOHOHOH. *insert best boss battle theme ever here*
The rude part here comes in not with the wording itself but the fact you felt the need to comment it in the first place. General rule of thumb is that unless someone asks you for advice or is posting in a cosplay advice subreddit, you should keep your opinions to yourself.
Did you mean this as a reply to someone??
no
Here's my opinion:. . I don't want to be rude, but it doesn't look like sweetheart. And no, it's not because of your biology. I don't care about it.. . I mean the clothes.. . . . As you can see, she wears fluffy dress, meanwhile your dress is not that fluffy.. . * The same problem with a bow.. . Next problem: I don't see the accessories. Like: Her heart chain or heart belt.. . Overall: I don't care about your physique, I am talking about clothes here, cuz it's what cosplaying is about.. . My advices: Try searching Sweetheart cosplay clothes that are good quality and fits you.. . Or if you need to econom money, try searching for pink dress and other clothes you can see on sweetheart and make custom cosplay.. . Anyone reading it, be polite and tell me if you feel like to say something without toxicity.. . Remember, this is my opinion and it might conflict with yourself. And for OP: Do whatever you feel like. The main thing it if you enjoy it yourself
I do have the belt but it’s hard to see because of my position. If you zoom in near my arm you can kinda see the heart on the belt. As for the dress, at the time I didn’t have a petticoat that would’ve made the dress fluffier. This dress is from the Lolita brand Baby the Stars Shine Bright so it’s good quality and it fits comfortably . . I’m glad you’re not making this about my size or my disability, but I don’t appreciate you criticising my cosplay. It’s not perfectly like hers but it’s still recognisable as her and not everyone can buy or make completely canon outfits.
It's okay, the main thing is you having fun or enjoying yourself!. . Have good time with your cosplay 👍
Thank you!
I think it does look like sweetheart’s outfit - but the pinks are all the same, where it may read slightly better with brighter/more contrasting pinks (like on the wheelchair).
That's true too
Oh fuck yeah
Swint hirt
Sweet jelly filled dount
OHOHOHOHO-
Excellent!
Love this cosplay super cute!!
Im getting PTSD from attempting to fight Sweetheart at level ~12 and having to grind the castle for XP. . . Amazing cosplay though
i’m so fucked up for laughing at it at first.. . . honestly, really good, the dedication to the fit is bewildering in my opinion. striked the pose perfectly too
Sweetheart if omori used her bat to disable her for good
Now all you need is a hole in your torso
Ahh wdyk the worse character in the entire game. Even worse than sweetheart.
That isn't how that works but ok
&#x200B;. . 
That isn't how that works but ok
&#x200B;. . . . (deafness)
woah this looks awesome! great cosplay ohoho\~ 
OHOHOHOHO\~ Thank you so much!
Okey, but the question is, did you carve a hole through your belly to stay true to the character?. . Just kidding, great cosplay.
Hahahaha sweet question, but only a perfect suitor would know the answer! :'D. . I'm glad you like it tho!
Ohohohoho  Great cosplay!
I'm happy you like it! <3
Yes, it's really well done! GJ!
Awesome cosplay!!! 
Thank you! :3
Amazing!!! 
Ahhh I love it!! Did you make it/get someone else to make it, or did you buy it? I’ve been trying to find one everywhere! D: 
I made the dress, bow and belt by myself. Her weapon is a gift. Some very good friend made it to me with 3D print :3 and the blouse is store bought, bc I’m not THAT good in sewing haha 💗
Oh wow you’re so talented!! I hope I can learn how to do that someday and make it myself too! 💕
YES THE SHOES THE DRESS THE WEAPON. MY QUEEN HAS ASCENDED PAST THE 2D BODYPILLOW FORM 
Ahahahaha, uh I mean OHOHOHOHOHOHOHO ~~ thank you very much 💗💗💗
Ayy nice, does the mace retract or is it always extended out?
Thank you! It’s always extended but I used some braid holders when walking around with it to tie it together so I don’t accidentally hurt anyone! 💗
IT LOOKS SO GOOD! 
ohohohohohohohohoho
Almost as divine as the body pillow! OHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOH-YACKYACKYACK
this is so amazing.... and wonderful...... omg..........
Glad you like it! 💗





*slurp*
i can hear her laugh ~ohoho~

Amazing cosplay, looks like I’m about to get flailed
You better be careful!

Most impressive, certainly astonishing. Very well done with the cosplay, quite accurate to the source material. Have a gold from me, hopefully this will help get more recognition here.
😭😭😭😭😭 thank you so much!!! 💗💗💗💗💗
Danggg this looks really well made haha you're so cool what are your pronouns :DDDDD
Haha thank you! She/her + they/them are fine :3 💗
real nice cosplay :) i always love seeing sweetheart cosplayers that have the prop because its always so cool :)
It iiiiiis! Imo it’s the best part of my cosplay :‘D 💗💗💗

Ooh epic! Am I invited to the wedding for Space Husband?!?! 🥺🙏
Wedding for WHO? I do know NOTHING about that person 💗💗💗
Whoaaaa cool!!!
Thank you! 💗💗
No problem keep slaying girlie UvU
Bro looking good! Where'd you get that mace from tho? 
Thanks! The mace is a gift from one of my best friends. Her boyfriend made it for me using his 3D printer! 💗
The worst part of truly accurate Sweetheart cosplay is having to have a great big hole surgically implanted into your middle, surely.. . Seriously, great job!
Ohohoho, I thought about it, but splitting my spine and rearranging my internal organs just a week before the convention...that was a little too time constrained for me! Maybe next year! 💗💗💗💗. Thank you! :3

Thank you SO much! 💗💗💗🎀
Hey
Hey
Sorry I got nervous
Amazing job ohohoho\~! 
thank you so much, Ohohoho \~
OMG IT LOOKS SOOO COOOL

OHOHOHOHOHO. . * Quote from the jelly donut queen known as Sweetheart 
So Cute!!! ❤️

THATS MY GIRLFRIEND YEAHHH YOU GO GIRL
Ohohoho, your cosplay is most certainly impressive! Did you make the entire cosplay (including props) by yourself? - signed, SWH 
Jst the props, belt and ribbon! The rest is a combination of different clothes with a few alterations
Looks so nice! I can see all the effort that went into it.

The fact you made the HUD part of your cosplay goes hard as shit. Congrats
Tysm! Highly appreciated 🕺
THE PROP IS SO CREATIVE WHAT
GIRL THIS IS MAJESTIC 
that's actually so fucking smart wtf 
Epik cosplay

OHOHOHO your cosplay is awesome
This is beauty, this is grace, 10/10
The lady at the side looks so judgemental 😭

Now put a hold in your tummy 
I like to imagine that someone in the world has some rare condition that makes them look that way. And they’re destined to cosplay Sweetheart.
Very good :thumbsup:
Slay
Hm.... it's almost perfect.... but it doesn't give me undying rage the moment I look at you.
Here is a spaceboy to your sweetheart.. . Careful, he's fragile. . 
I will marry him for the 327th time after we broke up 
noo you’ve broken his heart enough times 😭

. . Here's the finished with a dead bug on it for some reason?. . Note: I did not kill said bug.
Did anybody have Sweetheart boss music play in their head when seeing this nice Sweetheart?

Among the better cosplays shown here. Good job!

Boo, good cosplay but wrong character to pick, Perfectheart is *clearly* superior lmao . . (Jk, I don't really care if it's one character or another specifically, it looks like you put a lot of time and effort into this and it really paid off!)

THIS IS SO AMAZING AAHHH
thank youu!!!


it seems they do reset, but only after a traumatic event or basically a brick wall of progress. such as the team being trapped in sweetheart's castle, all dying in Humprey, or in the abyss.
Found sweetheart

Why else do you think sweetheart choose him?
Found 3 areas where you can enter Blackspace from Dreamspace. . . 1 is in Sweet Hearts castle - it's where all the bears are in the dungeon. To be more specific, it's top right, inside the cage. Fun fact about that one, if you enter Blackspace, chicken out, and go back to sweethearts castle, the bears respawn and you have to fight all of them again...lol....This Blackspace area, has you walking from one area of a forest, to another. At the end of the forest, there was a door. I killed myself before progressing further though. . . Another is in the Abyss, right past Abbi. Though I think you guys have this down already.. . The third: Which I think is the most obvious one, is where the Shark Boss dude is. it's in his elevator. This one is interesting, cause it takes you to the treehouse area from the original Blackspace. Only thing that's new there, is this tiny "Black Something" that's inside of the treehouse. Interact with it, and it disappears. . . I'm under the impression that there might be more Blackspace gates throughout Dreamspace. The Sweet Heart Castle one was really tucked away. I wonder if there might be more like it.. . 1 last thing to note. There is a new "Something" that I found. It's by the tree with the tire swing attached to it in Vast Forest. Interacting with this tree, and the tire disappears - spooky style. I think everyone has come across this. But...If you leave this area, and enter it again. There is a new Something here. It's unique to all of the other Something's in the game I think. This is in the Hikkomoir route.
I found another entrance at the endless highway. There was a black car, which took me to the houses area from original black space
when entering blackspace from dreamspace, does it look the same as it does at the end of the game?
Yeah. But I haven't delve much deeper into them. As it turns out, there has been a lot of discoveries on how to get to Blackspace 1 and 2 from Dream Space. You can find a list of them on YouTube somewhere.
I found that unique something by the tire swing on my normal route in the game. I don’t believe it’s unique to the omori route
This game has a lot of symbolism on the same level of Cry Of Fear or Silent Hill.
i mean it's pretty clear where the theming for the last resort comes from (that ocean blackjack computer game)
this is really possible!! great theory, it makes so much sense. I was wondering where those characters fit in reality
wow, just... wow
Whoever ordered Sweetheart should have asked for "a donut directly from the oven" and not just "a hot donut"
Such an obnoxious person has no right to be that hot 
The crazy ones are always the best ones 
I think we should stop this thread here 
Yes
What happened 
He posted a link to some study about men preferring to do the wacky wonky with bozo women
Sweetheart Change to be a \[\[big shot\]\] 
>! You know who else has strings attach to them? !<
MY MOM!
Sweetheart doesn't need such human things as "bones." And "muscles." To move that good 
hell yeah sweetheart has \[becomed\] neo 
perfectheart = sweetheart neo
No Sweetheart is Queen. Basil is Spamton. At least in my mod.... .  <-- Quite the Big Shot
big shot 
Nows your chance to >!cut!< A >!big eye!<
Then again, sweetheart has a pretty normal donut hole, unlike jelly filled donuts irl, we can see this in one of the movies, and of course the body pillow.
HOLY SHIT, SWEETHEART IS SPAMTONG CONFIRMED?!?!?! 
They both give good things to people, since the Keeper gave Sweetheart a castle, and may give Omori his own private room.
>!But time went by And the boy grew older And the tree was often alone And then the boy came and said "emoji:something:" and the tree said "wtf"!<
I would guess [Sweetheart's morningstar](). . . It would be in theme with the other medieval weapons.
Isn’t it a flail?
Youre right, i meant to say a flail, then wasnt sure if the morningstar had the chain but it showed with a chain when I looked it up and rolled with it hahaha shouldvd known 
I see, sorry for being ‘that guy’.
you are appreciated!
Sometime we need that guy!
Tha flail has a chain, the morning star doesn't
Yes, this has already been established/pointed out 
I would like to point out **the fact that sweetheart has canonically put a past iteration of Omori and his friends on a literal [medieval torture device]((torture))** (and a pretty horrific one at that)
Hold up where is this canon???
One of 'em has a bow.
Probably not. Its a medieval armory, a simple knife wouldnt go there. Given what’s present, my guess is that its either a flail mace (sweethearts in particular) or Marsha’s Halberd.
Wow you’re being an actual sweetheart
I mean we vent using the dungeons in sweethearts castle and the late maximus lineage was about to report us
They don't know that SWEETHEART is The Impostor 😓
Great idea! Release a marketable, yet questionable, product and then just shift all the blame on Sweetheart. Works every time!
Let’s see if this happens again next valentines
Sweetheart didn’t actually hack her Twitter.. . OMOCAT just let Sweetheart go fuckin wild on the funny bird site and then OMOCAT just beat Sweetheart to death with a nail board.
I love that painting of Sweetheart 
I'm pretty sure that sweetheart is supposed to be a movie franchise in the real world since kel says something about sweetheart movies when he enters hobbeez with you for the first time
I'm still suprised people like sweetheart.. . . (not judging its just that her entire personality seemed like, asshole, or maybe it's because I only did one route?)
Sweetheart get the stars 
What?
So ur telling me that I could've gotten something more rare? Like possible sweetheart plush? 
where sweetheart plush
I interacted with the mirror in Sweetheart's castle when it first happened to me, it was odd it happened though cause the background behind the mirror was the same of the playground's one
This woman is having fun while I’m crying myself to sleep without a Sweetheart body pillow…. . OMOCAT please I’ll do anything for the Sweetheart body pillow.
Pardon me, *raises bat* I have some business to take care of
Why does Sweetheart feel the need to type all that?
Everyone who likes sweetheart is a sproutmole, it says so in the Bible
🌱  .  oh please, do I look like a sproutemole to you?  . 👣
yes, I can tell by the smell of dirty laundry 
Should have been 
And tofu
omoli
Hands down best character
Wait a second. . ...Is it bad that it took me this long to register why he was called Omoli
Yes.
Omoli moment  . Real 
: yes. . (she would put omoli in the blender)
Wait, but what if you're a Sprout Mole that doesn't like Sweetheart? 
<— War criminal (probably)
. . (She has commited \~500 war crimes)
Technically Sweetheart IS a war criminal, one of the laws of War was "Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated." Rococo was imprisoned and left without any human treatment, therefore Sweetheart is a war criminal
True, but as far as i'm aware, Rococo never fought in a war...Unless you count the war between him and all sweetheart's ~~simps~~ fans, that is.
No no, uncensor simps.. . Or, if you're going to censor it, at least replace it with "stupid adoring fans", considering that's what she calls them.
She has 97 mental illnesses and isn't allowed in most public spaces
yea 
probably?
Sweetheart should listen to friends (i mean the OST, not the show) on repeat and every time it ends she forgets everything so she can be jumpscared again 
She has friends? 
I mean the OST
Oh, lol, okay
She doesn't have any friends
Now that I think about it…
I approve of this idea. 
PEOPLE I DON'T REALLY LIKE. . YOU. . MYSELF. . SWEET-FUCKING-HEART. . I REALLY HATE SWEETHEART. . THE TWAT
Sweetheart did nothing wrong. . >!Except grooming a minor, abusing authority, assault, being indirectly responsible for murder on stage and simping over her own self!<
Also domestic abuse
Those are just quirks!
Everything sweetheart does is a product of Sunny's psychological desire for mean girls
it checks out
thats a nice headcannon you got there,. . i'll be taking it.
tbh i did like sweetheart a little, but it was just like “oh fuck off ”. disliked her but in a light-hearted way
I agree with OMOR-MOMENT he seems cool
sweatheart did everything wrong
r/userflairchecksout
duality of omori fans 
sweetheart did nothing wrong, but if she did, they deserved it.
BABILINE PFP
Sweetheart did 50% of what she did wrong.
the other 50% also wrong
And that other 50% also wrong
but can we agree the only thing she did right was her banger theme
By all accounts, I should be one of the Sweetheart haters. I usually dislike characters with many of her personality traits, she is in general a terrible person,and I dislike it when a character is as romance Obsessed as her (like, very dislike it).. . Logically, I should despise her for all of those reasons. However, I like her anyways. Not only do I like a character who I *should* hate, I have her as my favorite character in the entire game. And I don't really understand why, myself.

And then there's me who likes her BECAUSE she did everything wrong 
Mmm food 🐳
Me who hasn’t played the game and just like the characters and themes: 👁👄👁. . Who tf is sweetheart?
 <--- sweetheart
I understand everything now
She's like Dutches from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends
Sweetheart did everything wrong. . . But she's ho- I mean, pretty, so whatever
 He's cute and alse, but very annoying. I am neutral to her
I was just thinking this yesterday, and then I found Roccoco and I remembered why I hated Sweetheart in the first place
Everything or nothing, at least we all can agree that Sweetheart did wrong
Me: (Scrolls though the comments to see if u/CMSamurai is here)
I was asleep, okay? 
Fair, sleep important.
Fair, sleep important.
sweetheart did everything wrong (and that’s why i like her  )
Sweetheart did evnoerything wrong
Sweetheart committed domestic abuse and tortured children. She is fun but i hate her
I thought I was in r/Berserk subreddit for a moment.
I HTATS WEETHEART SO MICH!!,!
Sweetheart did everything wrong but it was funni so it's ok 
The duality of a man
Who's Sweetheart? I only know Tofu Mhmm...Delicious Sweethea I mean Tofu 
Sweetheart did some things wrong, no one is perfect and thats okay.. . EXCEPT PERFECTHEA-
I’m on both side’s
I am neutral to Sweetheart
Sweetheart did everything wrong
battle between good and evil is right here
sweetheart is hands down my favorite character inside headspace..
sweetheart is really tasty when you prepare her properly, although any meal made using her can be ruined pretty easily
Me trying to explain to my friends that omori is a good game despite the sweetheart body pillow thing: uh so uhm omori is a pretty cool game uh just ignore that-
Sweetheart finna fall into a conveniently placed time portal and take over Headspace 50 years in the future 💀
r/foundthesweetheart
Ain't no way this was real...
I like how the members of this sub tripled in 7 hours after my comment
Me

And I'm here being in love with Sweetheart.
sweetheart is great👍
you should've played sweetheart's castle theme, that would be cool
I really like the one the plays during Sweetheart's fight
Sweethearts Castle because that makes me wanna turn into Gabriel Agreste when he danced in season 5 that one time
I've got like 4-5 hours, I can't get past Sweetheart
Sweetheart and The Slime Girls are dead I think? At least they got finished off by Humprey not by us. Unless I missed something
They’re alive in the >!hikikomori!< route
Technically >!the good ending is the canon route and they're dead there?!<
We never go into humphrey again in the sunny route. . so slime girl's and sweetheart are probobly just still the heads and sweepheart
Either that or headspace >!gets fucking demolished in the good end in which case EVERYONE THERE DIES AND IT DOESN’T MATTER MUCH!<
It’s good XP for sweetheart too!
it is!!! i beat her really easily and i was astonished when one of my friends said he struggled with the boss... then i realized i was probably overleved since i had also beaten king carnivore easily...
Well it also could just be harder if you dont understand the fight at first. Or if you get unlucky with sweetheart’s attacks
LEVEL 5? WHAT. . Bro was speedrunning wtf. . Tip: don't go to (next boss) >!sweetheart!< until atleast level 16/17. . Spoiler of where she is: >!you fight her after the garden part where you go up to the show again!<
Utilize emotions it makes the game so much easier but it took me till after I faced sweetheart to remember 1) they were a thing 2) how they worked
some of us are organizing to draw sweetheart, is there a way to add her to the blueprint of tampermonkey??
contact the organizers on discord
thanks, kept typing "give seizure movie" on my keyboard the whole time lol
YOURE KIDDING I TYPED “GIVE TENNIS MOVIE” AND IT MAGICALLY APPEARED LFJAJX
My god it worked for the multiplying moles movie too
wait does this actually work? how?
IT WORKED
used 20 min to see Tofu Production Movie :(
2 year old post but does anyone know if you have to watch each movie for a certain amount of time? I'm confident I've seen and skipped through all of them but haven't gotten the achievement, thank you.
You probably found out by now but I'm still replying in case it helps someone, personally I skipped them all and still got the achievement
Beach. Christmas. Dragon. Dress. OwO. Tennis. Twitchy. Tofu. Driving. Hypnosis. Cheating. . Edit... This was accident... I was typing the names in here in case I can't remember them.
Only one I'm struggling to get is the hypnosis
i sat here for 30 mins w o realizing i already got the achievement  . why didnt it pop u 😭
Yeah that sounds like a good plan lol. . I dunno about rarity, I was under the impression that it was completely random. I could be wrong about that. You're bound to get it soon, though!
Tofu one also took me a lot, and soap opera one + tennis one
The Multiplying Moles Movie is a parody of Badger Badger Badger (Mushroom!)
I'm literally struggling to get the donut one 💀
I want to cry
Thanks for this  <3
i dont know how much timr its been i just know ive seen 10 movies multiple times
Ive been trying for an hour and still cant get the tofu production film :/
That sucks dude. RNGesus is a bitch sometimes. But keep sticking with it and you'll get it eventually! If you need to take a break and do other quests in the meantime go for it, you can always make a save and come back to it later
The Tennis one is a nightmare for me
Seizure Movie. . Days of Our Lives. . Road Trip Move. . Jurrasic Heart. . Christmas Movie. . Hypnosis Movie. . Multiplying Moles. . Tofu Production Film. . The Wimbledon. . Beach Awooga. . Dress . . Alright gg
WAIT HOLD ON OP. I THINK D AND K ARE SWITCHED. You found K (which is supposed to be in Sweetheart’s Castle in the art gallery) in the Junkyard, where D is supposed to be. My guess is that if you go where K is supposed to be you’ll find D. Remember to keep on playing in French just in case!
RESPOND TO THEM, NOT ME
WAIT HOLD ON OP. Based on one of your comments I think D and K ARE SWITCHES. You found K (which is supposed to be in Sweetheart’s Castle in the art gallery) in the Junkyard, where D is supposed to be. My guess is that if you go where K is supposed to be you’ll find D. Make sure that you are playing in French when you go look for D! Hope it helps!
OM MY LORD YOU WERE RIGHT
LETS GOOOO! GLAD TO HAVE HELPED
K i'll try
There's a few things you should add in.. . * For the "There's Something Behind You..." achievement, you can't get the achievement if you take the knife in the kitchen before going to bed. I don't know if this has been fixed yet, but doing the Recycultist dungeon forces you to equip the knife, so you can't get the achievement in the Normal route after doing the dungeon.. . * For the "Bees?" achievement, the wasps nest will disappear once you return to Kel's house after picking up the food with him.. . * The mirror in the Servant's Quarters in Sweetheart's Castle does not show up until after you beat Sweetheart.
Alright, thanks for letting me know! I'll make sure to include this in the doc once I wake up later today.

this would make a good copypasta
Alright
Are both routes (Hikikomori and True Route) accounted for in this guide? I wanted to do the things necessary to get all achievements (perfect) in the game.
The guide does account for both routes: you won’t be able to do everything since you have to pick a route, naturally.
Sorry this is super late, but what about the keys for hangman? Don’t you need all of them to explore all areas of the game? I read somewhere to get the Z key last, as someone who got another key last glitched their game somehow. But I think you have to wait until one day left to get all of them.
Yeah, I can add the KEYS. I'll also test out if the KEYS do glitch out when you don't collect the Z KEY last. Thanks for bringing attention to that.
I just did some testing and here is what I found:. . \-I did not experience any oddness immediately after reloading my game from the force-quit caused by collecting the last KEY. I did this with the X KEY.  . \-If you have the Skip Splash Screens mod installed when you collect the last KEY in HANGMAN (any KEY, including the Z KEY), then the game will fail to load until you remove the mod from the mods folder. The mod simply cannot be in the mods folder when you try to reload the game from the scripted HANGMAN force-quit. I guess the splash screens and the reloading are related somehow.. . I would appreciate if you could point me to whatever it was you found where someone said their game was bugged after collecting a non-Z KEY to finish the HANGMAN game.
I just finished adding the HANGMAN KEYS. If you want, you can use the Google Docs version of the guide and Ctrl+F to search for the KEYS you need: [
Thank you so much! I think I’ve got the keys figured out, but this will be a huge help to others visiting this thread, no doubt.. I’m on one day left. I looked away from my switch after completing the sorting chore (I messed it up but hopefully that’s okay) for like ten seconds and the screen went black with SOMETHING in all corners, is that normal and the sign that I should go back to sleep?. For some reason the guide I’m following doesn’t have a section for one day left in headspace.. Can I ask what order you would recommend doing things in? The Abyss should be last, right? . In the meantime I’m gonna finish leveling up (I heard 50 is the max, I’m almost there) and go to snow globe mountain.
Thank You So Much!! <3
I finally defeated her ty tysm!!
no problem 😃
:)
2 years later and this still helped
How did you get the rain cloud?! I've looked everywhere but I can't find it.
tysm i defeated her
Beat her in first try with this, thank you so much!
Pretty Sure Sweetheart's Bed and Movie Theater count too
I've seen conflicting info on this, but this is good to keep in mind just in case. :D
well... those were the two i had to do to get the achievement, maybe it changed between versions, again, conflicting information
I can confirm! Sweethearts bed and theater chair do count for the PS4 version. Had to go back to every single one when I found this post and tried her castle. Frustrating to say the least, but glad I finally got the achievement!
At first I thought Junko Enoshima. Then Sweetheart.
Hm, so then the Sweetheart's Castle would be a chess board lol
Nice mod, it's looks pretty funny to play. You will add more things or is only about sweetheart and sprouts moles?
There are plans for a lot more, don't worry <3. . (In fact, something is already in the mod)
She’s very important to the plot and all over the game, I’d recommend playing the game, she’s a sweetheart 
We need plushes of all the bosses, sweetheart especially
It's a canon answer, though. There's even a house with donut grandmas in Orange Oasis and one of them mentions Sweetheart.
Oh damn... Wow
Sweetheart even has a special reaction if you use a donut while in her battle.
Really? That's cool
my friend. they think that sweetheart is ugly :((
Her personality is definitely not pretty, but she looks hot regardless to me. Guess your friend has some odd taste.
i can’t remember an explanation in the game, does anyone know why sweetheart has a hole in her?
she is a humanoid donut/doughnut
wait so the whole “sweet, jelly filled donut” thing was actually accurate? lol
>!His folks who are literal donuts mention her in orange oasis!<
Not only that, they have this photo stored in their house
Sure he is 16 and horniness comes in but, assuming he never really been exposed in sussy stuff, there wont be a reason he would make those stuff up, tho this could've been cause by him watching sweetheart on tv since its said that sweetheart is from an anime
This video made me obsessed over Omori. I use to not even know what the game was about or that it even existed in the first place. One of my friends showed to me in a discord call and said I should play it but idk at the time I told him "yeah I'll check it out" and then I just lost interest. Then boom there was the video, calling me beckoning me to watch it, I originally intended to just have it in the background as I drew some art to post in my twitter but after just after watching the start of it I knew I had to buckle down and watch the whole thing. Nearly cry several times but I managed to actually keep my tears in, since I didn't want to cry  (I ended up crying the day after watching the video). And after watching it I just began watching anything with Omori in the title, specially animations and meme compilation, and finally I couldn't take it anymore and bought the game yesterday. Now I'm doing a true ending run and I've already beaten sweetheart!
what about sweetheart fans (they eat tofu for her 😨)
0/10, no sweetheart bodypillow 
“I used to only like SWEETHEART ironically… and now here I am… What happened to me?”
I want to punch it because Sweetheart is a bitch.
SHINEI! SWEETHEART!
Then the problem isn’t that you are a minor, is that you live with your parents lol. If your parents didn’t care you wanted to fuck a sweetheart body pillow then being a minor doesn’t really matter. I do get what you’re saying though.
Wait sweethearts age is confirmed? I thought she was just implied to be an adult.
I mean, you get a body pillow as one of her equips in Sweetheart's Castle and it's a pretty decent midgame weapon.
also pessi, the sweetheart fan in otherworld
I GOT THE SWEETHEART KEYCHAIN . . >!because i already have a body pillow and i wouldn’t wear the sweatshirt in public!<
You mean *Sweetshirt*
Ba dum tss
Sniff... That joke... That joke was so bad.... It just makes me want to...
Sweetheart kinda bad tho
the sweetheart body pillow finna make me act up 😫
Gonna bust a donut
oh trust me, i'm gonna bust that dussy (donut pussy) alright
Even though i hate Sweetheart, i must say, this is interesting
I joked about getting bricked up over Sweetheart but I’m afraid it’s not a joke anymore
Mmm...Sweetheart-I mean tofu
*The Sweetheart dialogue descriptions are amazing...*
Oh god.. . Will my first body pillow ever be of Sweetheart?. . Jesus Christ
Isn’t sweetheart a dude..?
...what?
I thought they were, bc i heard it a thrown around a bunch
No.....
Oh
Excited for my sweetheart body pillow to get here!
Sweetheart bodypillow
a human size pillow of sweetheart
I agree with sweetheart being pride/arrogance.. . Maybe slime girls are lust? Like some kind of mad science experiments way to be specific.
Slime girls are lust because, well... Y'know...
I don't disagree with that one, but I kind of want to go for a more creative and kid friendly way.
Slime girls should be lust, and Sweetheart should 1000% be Pride, nothing about her indicates lust, it's all pride of herself
Both pride and lust fit Sweetheart so well
How is sweetheart lust
Sweetheart has a dating show and she is thirsty for hero (atleast at her portion of the game). . Although considering the origins of slime girls I feel like they fit more
I've been watching most of it, and the stream is REALLY good! Jaiden hasn't actually been majorly spoiled, and the chat hasn't been the worst at spoiling things (yet, lol). Jaiden has managed to avoid most spoils, and the superchatters give useful hints gameplay-wise that don't contain spoilers.. . For Jaiden herself, she's been enjoying it a lot and really likes the real-world parts of the game. She's a bit under-leveled right now but she managed to beat Sweetheart at a lower level.
ok mr sweetheart flair
Sweetheart > Fiction
I hate Sweetheart as a person and love Sweetheart as a character and proud owner of two bangers

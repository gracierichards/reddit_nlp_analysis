They were fun  asf tho and spaceboy got a huge ass glowup
The statue's moving!. I'm sure she was told by Spaceboy(sic) to...
: Uh... uh. . : Help me oneshot Spaceboy. . : Oh fuck yea
:But I wanna me-I mean beat the Space Boy. . :… really
: We Don't Care
:Alright let’s head over to his house
: .... . : Hey lovebirds! How much did you beat the shit out of Spaceboy?. . : (blushing) HEY! SHUT UP!
Space boy opens the door. . Space boy:Hello?. . :Your friendly neighborhood ass-wipers are here. . :Hiyaaaah!
Spaceboy is trans?!?!
Apparently? But the team didn't know that when putting him in the game so there's not much that alludes to that. I think someone asked about it with some art from some days before the game released and they said yes but the ppl working on the game didn't know
That is cool
[oh here's a post with the screenshots w/ proof of it!]()
can u ask for a space boyfriend plush too i'm lasy
I mean, that's literally what Brady thinks it is. He saw the movie in the castle with Sweetheart in a bikini, but in no other instance has he seen a hole in her stomach. He thinks that that movie represented something figurative about her. Even with the password to the statue and Spaceboy- Space boyfri- Space ex-boyf- Space husband's nickname for her, I don't think Brady has made the connection that she is LITERALLY a donut.
All I'm saying is I get why Spaceboy keeps going back
Damm Spaceboy, getting carried away exploring her.
Heath as cap spaceboy, i support that a 100 %
Space Boyfriend needs the Boot! I'm sure he'd get a...Kick out of it!
Well if I'm gonna be honest. . Space Boyfriend because all he did was get the big sad, get married (by the same person that gave him the big sad), gets divorced and becomes emo.
he gives us a free Ice-cone tho
…he’s a trauma victim? Under emotional and physical abuse?
Spaceboy.. . Not as interesting as the others tbh.
Because I like Spaceboy more, and he’s recurring
GET SWEETHEART OUTTA THERE AND MAKE SURE SHE GOES BEFORE SPACEBOY we love spaceboy
Spaceboy is the real sweetie/sweetheart (please get my joke people)
SO REAL

voting out captain space boy / space boyfriend hated him
spaceboy
I think it's me and spaceboyfriend against the world
Actually this is more prominent in Hikki route where development are fairly similar too, Spaceboy also goes full on suppression route to feel cold and neutral to forget his feelings. . . Another thing is how it’s the peak of a mountain, which would be polar opposite of place like blackspace which is more commonly considered as being deeper down, like deeper well. If blackspace is subconsciousness then the top would probably be peak consciousness/control over the feeling/rationale. . . To add to this the Angels are relatively very creepy and serious toned for place like dreamworld. Angels also are the only enemy in entire omori to actually have a skill that turn enemy neutral, even specifically targeting happy target first and foremost before any other skill of happy targets are present. Even more fun fact, there’s even unused text for over pierce heart skill, “Acta deos numquam mortalia fallunt...” which in Latin roughly translates to "Mortal deeds never deceive the gods...".. . Just to top it all off it’s all only accessible via Hikki route which mean the suppression style goes on full swing and start possibly leaking onto other character. . . …Snowglobe mountain is really something else lol
She provided captain spaceboy with like a bit of happiness at some point
Spaceboy might be underrated or fairly rated
If someone with a Izuru PFP and a Capt. Spaceboy flair says so, it is what is needed to be done
Yes comrade🤝🏻
Sorry Spaceboy :(
Noo he’s my favorite character
***N O***  leave my abuse victim alone!

No he should date me
he has two hands
Can you save a leg for me?
I'll take the other leg
Alright and just like that we’re out of room! Spaceboy has reached his full capacity, he’s ours now!. . Or should I say we’re his now 
The mouth

WHAT IS GOING ON IN THIS THREAD
I dunno, help
There's also his "laser blaster"
They both are pretty toxic for each other
Well  . I mean...  . Not really...
She was verbally abusive, locked him into her dungeon while ruining everything he loved, emotionally abusive, heavily toxic, egocentric, and she was never satisfied.
Also physically abusive, >!when you figth space ex-husband, one of his memory is her swinging her mace at him.!<
Oh she's terrible, no question.  . But he is also terrible.
Is he tho?
Well yeah. He's a codependent niceguy who treats his friends like trash. He pins all his sadness and failures on her and takes no responsibility for his own mistakes. He refuses to grow or develop the faintest degree of self-awareness. He's surrounded by people who are trying to build him up and he tosses them away (well, uses them) the moment he's offered the thing he thinks he wants the most, which is to use another person to build up his sense of self-worth.
...did he hurt you or what? I think you're ready WAY too much into a dramatic love story that happens in a depressed teen's head as a way of escapism.
no at the end of his story he evolves after talking to his dad in the hikikomori route, cus yk he is still a teenager or smth i think.
That's good to know. I didn't have the heart to go that route.
yh same, i just watched a play through by merg
> He refuses to grow or develop the faintest degree of self-awareness.. . He's a depressed teenager... living in a depressed teenager's mind....
How so?
The one thing that us shippers agree on. Spaceboy is such a cutie too I feel so bad for him
Absolutely
Spaceboy is a pirate tho, so we could make an exception
Spaceboy deserves better
i always ask myself what if perfectheart and spaceboy were together
Spaceboy × Perfectheart, where Perfectheart makes enslaved sweetheart act like a normal human being toward Spaceboy
This.. . Someone please introduce Spaceboy and Perfectheart. . He needs it and she wouldn't mind it
The best Spaceboy ship is Spaceboy x Robo, Mutant and PerfectHeart, because he deserves it
Is there actually art of that? That sounds really cute
I think there is if you dig deep enough, it's kinda underrated but when you find something it's usually gold
Yeahh capt Spaceboy deserves someone better.. >!like me  !<
Spaceboy deserves a lot of hugs
Spaceboy got out of his way to marry her just so she dumbs him the very next day. I feel really bad for Spaceboy
Comments: Spaceboy did nothing wrong!. . Therapists: If Spaceboy wanted to leave the toxic relationship, he could just *not keep going back.*
well, you can, but, it's undeniable that is very toxic (especially to Capt Spaceboy)
Poor spaceboy 
NOOOOOOOOOOOO SPACEBOYYYYY AAAAAAAAAAAAA 
Rip spaceboy... you will always remain in my heart
Capt Space boy 😍
Capt. Spaceboy
Yup
Capt. Spaceboy?
Nope, try again.
Oh yeah Capt. spaceboy
Yup
Captain spaceboy
Capt Spaceboy
Good job!
...Capt. Spaceboy?
Nah its the unbread twins
Oop. . Haven't fought that boss yet, only listened to their banger theme
Yeah a hell of a banger the theme was
Sure is 👍
Capt. Spaceboy ?
Yes!!
Capt. Spaceboy
Capt Spaceboy?
yes :)
Capt. Spaceboy
Correct! Isnt he just awsome?
Yes he is. :)
Capt. Spaceboy
No
Okay, Spaceboy, we need to have a serious talk in your choice of favorites.
What's wrong with her? Said Spaceboy
Well.... . . . I mean, some people would call her an entitled, narcissistic brat who doesn't care about you and will drain all love and joy and happiness from your life.. . That happened in the game.. . So there's that.
Yes
Captain Spaceboy final chapter (it's the last, so they're empty inside).
Yeah i know that feel: read a good story... and then final chapter.
Capitan Spaceboy, Space Boyfriend, Space Ex-Boyfriend, Space Husband, Space Ex-Husband, Pluto, Basil.
Capt. Spaceboy! :D
Space Boyfriend
omg spaceboy flair❤️
Spaceboy is an awesome character and he deserved so much better, also I see you've got nice taste too! 
Yesss! Spaceboy is my 2nd favorite character (kel is my first if you couldnt tell) and I totally agree. He's also really hot-. . Anyways!
Captain Spaceboy.
Captain spaceboy
Captain Spaceboy!!! 
Capt spaceboy
none of them I like all my friends!... and I don't love any of the enemies as characters so they don't count!!  Except for maybe space boyfriend? I wouldn't say I love him but he's probably my favorite.
on the plus side only one person has said me so that's cool I guess
Captain Spaceboy. The way that heartbreak physically harms him by first putting him in a catatonic state and then actually destroying his heart was quite interesting, and so was the way that Space Boyfriend was an allegory for how Omori does more harm than good to Sunny. What I’d have a problem with is that he’s incapable of learning from his mistakes.
Captain Spaceboy
I can see where capt. Space boy is coming from
In boss fights (except Sweetheart, Space Boy or Space Ex-Husband and Unbread Twins) i used happy emotions for my characters but in normal fights i used neutral.
All that and no Spaceboy.
Captain Spaceboy for sure
uhh ig it is capt. spaceboy
Space Boyfriend him
Space ex-boyfriend him
Dude now I feel even more bad for Spaceboy 😭😭😭
Time to switch your flair to Captain Spaceboy.
I absolutely do NOT want to get involved in this and receive the fourth chapter for FREE from you, because that would make it PIRACY which is ILLEGAL and pirates are BAD totally NOT COOL like >!Captain Spaceboy!<.
i need to kiss spaceboy or i will die
so real
i relate to this
Flair...checks out?
real
Hold up . . Did the new chapter just drop
Multiple I think
How many . I've reached 4. But I can't find 5
Yeah, I can’t find the new chapter either 
It would be quite the shame if someone sent me a pirate copy of this chapter since that isn’t allowed
it too would be quite the shame if they ensured that it is sent to my direct messages as outlined by the reddit user OMORI-ModTeam
Lmao they got him
He looks so. . Cute
i love him so much i need to kiss him QQ. .   . new blorbo...
SAME
I love the “and a bad drawing at that!”
My little simp
Spaceboy looks so adorable in the manga🥹
My son....he deserves so many head pats...
Yarr, any mateys willing to share sum their rum and fine biscuits with me old scurvy-ridden face?
He deserves the world
Bro outside of the controversy i love the art-style
It’ll be fun if we get to see Space Ex-husband later
This is cute but I honestly prefer the hot game version. . Spaceboy my spaceboloved
He is so silly
DID THE NEW CHAPTER DROP??
# YEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
Him just a lil babi boi

Fr
You know it would be so sad if the whole chapter somehow ended up in my dms 😔 (please???)
He really is the Satan of OMORI
The pacing wasn't very good (not chapter 1 level bad) but God it was so funny
oh my god i love him
wait people still care about the manga???? anyway spaceboy is adorable
Spaceboy fight
He's cosplaying as Captain spaceboy
That spaceboy cosplay 🥶🥶
It seems Captain Spaceboy finally moved on and joined the gang.
Captain Space Boy! :)
How cute!! I’d love to do a space boyfriend cosplay sometime :’)
Oh yeah pls do! I want to do a cosplay of him as well, but I’m SCARED of doing the wig :‘/D
Now we just need Capt. Spaceboy
every convention i go to i always look for one! i haven’t had any luck, but one day 😌
Oh yeah I remember seeing Spaceboy two cons in a row too
What parts were made? I think the jacket and gun are but I\`m not sure. Don\`t wanna be rude but SPACEBOY using a watergun is way too funny for me.
the cape/head piece/shoulder pads/ embellishments were all made by hand, the wig was just some random longer haired wig in a good color that they cut and styled. its also not a water gun its just a fake gun thats lights up and looks spacey. jacket and pants were bought separately after quite a bit of digging to find good pieces
Ah
Free at last
you dressed up as space boyfriend in an alternate universe
***AYO???*** SPACEBOY??
***I CAN EXPLAIN***
NAHHHH YOU CANT ANYMORE 📷
Space ex-husband would approve.
Nice cosplay who’s your captain space boy/ space bf/ ex bf/ husband. (Joke)
my pookiepie‼️‼️ <33
Ag oki
>!Also Space Ex-husband being pretty much a statue and then lashing out when they remind him of memories!<
After spaceboy
Fr space boyfriend (the character) made me gay*
I called him "space femboy" when I played (in a good way.)
Wait… . . There’s Space Boyfriend’s bedroom in real life?!
You can change party leaders and use SBF's piano in his bedroom with everyone, each person plays a different tune.
I just want a body pillow of Space Boyfriend is that too much to ask
Primarch space boyfriend 🤔
Damn gotta start calling uses Spaceboys
A Spaceboy body pillow though- ideally drawn extra buff by the (awesome) artist u/Raypunzel4801
I’ll be innocent of simping for the rest of my life
spaceboy, spaceboyfriend, space ex-boyfriend, spacehusband, and space ex-husband bought them all. also pessi bought it all too
You forgot rosa
Tbh if the drawing targeted spaceboy us shark simps could get more progress
Wait shit that means space boyfriend just got blended, ouch
yes i hate her >!(spaceboy kin haha)!< but she's a f>!s!<unny and self-absorbed character so in a way I love her
as a captain space boyfriend enjoyer i am greatly disappointed 
Join the business cat alliance
quite convincing.
Spaceboy fan here! Same.
Captain Spaceboy's CD (whatever it's called) or I Prefer My Pizza 90% Grease.
Personally, I really like *you were wrong. Go back.* a lot because I really am a fan of captain spaceboy- I mean space boyfriend- I mean space exboyfriend- j mean space husband- I mean space exhusband
🟩
. . (Can I bring a plus one to the party)
Yes.
Bringing my homie to the omorty (omori party)
🟪💜
And now, best song of omori, "*Personally, I really like * *you were wrong. Go back.* *a lot because I really am a fan of captain spaceboy- I mean space boyfriend- I mean space exboyfriend- j mean space husband- I mean space exhusband*"
Space Boyfriends tape - I Want Nothing More
I'd argue that Space Ex-boyfriend does die, since he is Captain Spaceboy's alter ego, and you don't see him anywhere after the fight (and I'm pretty sure Space Ex-husband is a different alter ego)
- Try to level up: you'll get XP and Clams, and sometimes free snacks (such as candy) or some random items. Battles are easier the more you farm XP.. - Keep everyone Happy, Estatic, etc. as Capt. Spaceboy tends to get angrier.. - Always refill juice and heart levels with snacks and Hero's Cook.. - Use the ultimate attack as much as you can (specially when everyone is happy and Capt. Spaceboy angry) as it deals a lot of damage.
I’ve heard Paintgun also used to Captain Spaceboy x Rococo
I just used Spaceboy's flare skill and uh... it didn't go quite as planned (I was so close to winning too...)
Damn, for a princess like her, she surely loved the California weather out there. No wonder Captain Spaceboy is constantly thinking of her night and day. 😑
Good cause I will.. . Edit: just realized my flare was spaceboy
Alternate timeline where spaceboy never flies into the castle and instead settles with a pillow. . Or after the hikikomori route gives up on sweetheart and instead uh... oh, the pillow again... yikes
Just gatta have her.
Doesn’t she marry space boy though? She’s at least an adult and also a donut. . Edit: read your comment wrong thought you were calling her a minor
There’s no point in buying the body pillow, Capt. Spaceboy probably bought out the entire stock by now
Either him or that creepy fat guy who still lives with his grandmother alongside Charlie did.
suddenly spaceboy's actions make a lot more sense
Captain Spaceboy: **I TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK**
this is all amazing stuff but i don't need a new hoodie and i ain't spending 80 dollars on a body pillow unless it's space boyfriend
I got stuck on ex spaceboyfriend
Spaceboy could also be Sloth as well.

I knew there were reasons she was the best, and it's the horny one.
-doesn’t elaborate. . -does leave and not return

Capitan spaceboy's space adventure now for game boy, game boy color, a remake for gameboy advance, nintendo ds, and as a minigame in the wario ware saga
Space boyfriend origin story 😔
So basically it’s what the game would be if we played from Captain Space boyfriend’s pov

On OMOCAT's website I already preordered one cuz it's the best shirt I've seen in my life
I feel like omocat took this art as inspiration for her latest work :0
Meanwhile me, waiting for an official Omocat art of Mincy
And cris. And curtsey. And candice. . . Go go go!!
and that chinese fish market lady
"U kIRR FRY"
blue haired girl is cris bro
Oh right how embarissing
np
wait omocat already did art of her?
CANDICE???!?!!!!????!?!?!?
can. . dice. . nuts. . fit in yo mouth
**dies**
you didn't do this...
Yeah, Omocat drew it and put it on their twitter
We need more Polly fanart.. . (I know this is official from Omocat but now that we have a more detailed design, we need more!)
I think CloverWorks (the studio for Wonder Egg Priority), A-1 Pictures (the studio for Anohana), or Kyoto Animation could pull it off (if OMOCAT could get either studio to adapt OMORI as an anime).
God, imagine the smoothness of Kyoto Animation for Omori.
yo imagine if the quality is like A silent voice or Violet Evergarden if kyoani animates it.
It's The Actual Masterpiece I've Played In My Entire Life Even OMOCAT Looks So Cute And The Merchandise She Made Is The Best Thanks For This OMOCAT We Hope You Make Omori 2
I don’t think there needs a second emoticon
Omotoun
Omoru*
[pictured tweet](). . [another tweet Omocat made]()
Thanks, man!
Omocat
I guess Polly is my favorite character now
If we go by the draft designs Omocat had for the Faraway characters, Polly was shown to be conceptualized as somewhere around 22-30.  Whether this still applies to Polly in the final game or not is unconfirmed.
All the fan art and my headcanon was pretty close. Very cool.. . Hope omocat makes more art of characters or maybe even au's and stuff one day
Omocat pretty regularly posts group shots of the whole gang Completely and Totally Fine and just hanging out (Though it's usually for merch deals) so they at least seem to support a no-trauma AU lol
Mommy- i mean mommy- i mean
This is a Starbucks sir
Mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy I mean mommy
Holy shit the thirst comments here. People need water so badly
M I L F
"Its not about if she has kids or not snake. Its about milf energy.". . "Milf energy huh...milf energy"
[Source!]()
does she want a cracker
Nah she wants water to put out the blowtorch
I'm jealous of her fashion
Ikr her clothes and color choice id the perfect mix of sexy/attractive but also judt beautiful and cute.. . Goes well with her brown hair and darker skin as well
r/SUS
Good bot
Polly simps come out of hiding and rise up
Fashionista. . Astounding, impeccable, ground breaking
And maybe if he was 10 years older
And if the woman wasn't a live-in hospice nurse. Flirting with a woman that your family is paying to live there has got to be a new level of weird/creepy.
She's gorgeous!!
Is it Plushie time? I think it’s plushie time.
body pillow time-
YAY POLLY!
Polly my beloved
Reminds me of Niko's mom tbh
Which Niko? Love Live?
Oneshot
Mommy? Sorry.
Whne when she
Whoaa she's so pretty, who would've thought?
Who is Polly?
. . I didn't remember her either.
she adorable :)
:D
don't simp for polly don't simp for polly don't simp for polly don't
my dick is confused
Mommy? Sorry
at some point omocat is gonna start just drawing lewd art and the mods are gonna have a choice to make
*"Oh no, she's hot!"*
This is exactly how I expected her to look like!!!. She looks so sweet!
She is young, told ya guys, she is like 22
Aw, what a cute design.
Wtf I love Polly now???
Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry. Mommy? Sorry.... Mommy?
Major ara ara vibes
Imma be the weird one and say, she'd be an excellent soft dom
Always knew she was a bombshell
It solidifies a best character when the creator makes more art of them in their honor.
kinda reminds me of my girlfriend a bit
*starts gay panicking*
why do i kinda look like her
if you flip the picture upside down it becomes an owo
She’s absolutely gorgeous!
I’m crying over her
Oh she's so pretty
She's nice 
Mommy i mean mommy i mean mommy-
Daamnnn
Polly’s a milf. confirmed.
She's the Mom that Stepped Up
🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
Welcome to simp space
sssssmmmmmaaaassssshhh
Wow, I bet omocat must be really proud making the image so interpretative.
Who knows. I've been told to think outside of a box I've never been in.
I mean, I think omocat go through that too while making the game
Oh. So you guys didnt knew?. Omocat was working for me (read the nick). . So yes,. We gave u depression,. Now. . The money,. Hand me over. NOW
I'm too used to Omocat sharing upsetting artwork/memes, I kept looking for a trick with this one.
It’s more just sorta bittersweet really. Seeing what used to be and now isn’t.
What about polly tho? That one had no tricks
I guess this makes "please forgive me" hit way harder so...thats something
Wait when does that happen?
looks like we've found a new image to worship
We could make a religion out of this.
r/suddenlybillwurtz
No, don't.
Aww.. Well,that's cute.
oh my god thats adorable
Brazil's smile has some Chara vives. I guess it's intended.
Damn, Brazil's got some issues.
This is so cute, i love OMOCAT art style
This makes the present even more sad because she was the one who introduced him to the friend group in the first place
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
FIREFLOWER REAL????????????
cute 😊
What nice art
Everytime omocat tweets something, everyone instantly rushes to reddit so they can karmawhore the crap out of her tweet
Aubey
awww!!
It's so cute :) this is just extremely adorable
:D
:DD
When you got two mouths
BAHAHAHAHA
It’s just them being friendos
That's why Omocat is trolling
Dude,, she’s not even trolling,, this is just cute art of some friends. I doubt it’s even ship bait. It’s normal for friends to hold hands. Again, why do people assume everything is ship art
Thanks to be clear
It's obvious that they were great friends in the past.
i have submitted myself to omocat-shop.com
If I remember correctly I think it's from Omocat's twitter
I don't think this means that they're canon but I hope so. Please Omocat just say it already they are canon or not??
Im betting it all on non canon
Omocat shouldve female version in the game. That wouldve been dope
I'm looking forward to a death battle between Omocat and Sr Pelo since Sr Pelo says he wants to do the opposite with his creations.
sr pelo wants his creations to be manic?
 \* Glances at Mokey's Show, Johnknee and Ill  and Underpants \*. . You could say that.
The only one where the main characters end up happy is the Spooky Month
Ill would like to have a word with you.
Tfw even your creator makes jokes at your expense. Rest in pieces, watermelon boy.
why does everyone keep on bullying the herb boy :(((
weed child
weed kid
Cause he's just so delicious!
We have to save basil from omocat
*BREAKING NEWS: Fans break into game developer’s home, steal a watermelon and nothing else*
We doing this
We must save the flower boy from Omocat
*Some may call us criminals, but we prefer the word vigilantes*
If you prefer being call "vigilantes" than you have to call us "pirates" Free to play.
*whatever it takes*
Oh my god I have an image just like you profile pic, the only difference is the hat
do you mean its a different hat or that theres no hat? Because just having an image of grimm isnt that interesting
Different hat, my one is Grimm wearing my profile pic
you should make that your profile pic, then we can start the Grimm with hat gang
Ima do it now
Done
Nice
I'm laughing at this.. . *~~Send Help~~*
Omoriboy comic in a nutshell..... . Sorry
I both love and hate when creators are self aware of their fandoms cus they do shit like this.
mmm yummy watermelon. . *let's eat it*
this is not ok
>!\*Squish*!<
based omocat
nooooo :c
fr tho that watermelon lookin tasty
i thought we all agreed not to talk about that scene
Omocat: I like to make my characters miserable!. . George RR Martin: I like to kill my characters!. . ~~Hideo~~ Hidetaka Miyazaki: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  . #AMATEURS
>Hideo Miyazaki. . Did you mean Hidetaka Miyazaki?
Yes him. I always mix up the names of Japanese devs ... . FukMuhLayf
cool but where the fuck are the seeds
In blackspace obviuosly
Sadness
Deserved
I could hear the sound effect.
OHOHOOHOHOHOHO ONONONONONOHOHOOH
lmao
This is why I love omocat among other reasons lol
OH MY GOD THAT’S HORRIBLE I LOVE IT
She didn't. SHE DIDN'T.  . . . Also, that cleaver disturbs me.
SHE TOUCHED DA CHILD!!!
mark this nsfw next time thanks
No seeds
NO!!!
lol
No.. you can’t just do that!. . Not after the. . *Elevator death in black space*    **shudder**
Omocat on the right side of history.
Omocat treats it like a spoiler so I think it's a bit of a tiny twist
Scared me lmao I really thought it was omocat that just responded saying it’s tomorrow
I hope that omocat understands I would pay ludicrous amounts of money for a physical switch release. holy shit this art is good
bro same, and thank you!! :D
EXACTLY! THIS IS WHAT OMOCAT DOESNT WANT YOU TO KNOW!!!
Omor is just so cute and chubby  sorry Omocat you lose
Every masterpiece has its cheap imitation. Doesn’t matter if it’s official OMOCAT, they can’t compete with  true plush talent
Omocat just announced it with the image, they can't be bought YET
Oh, that’s cool.
Yesterday by OMOCAT
The first one was announced by omocat yesterday
Congrats to OMORI and OMOCAT for this massive achievement! 🏅🎖🥇
Oh that’s definitely why Omocat picked that to be her birthday
Holy shit!! My guy! Phenomenal job on this! It genuinely looks like an official Omori animation by OMOCAT themselves! If you tried to pass it off as real, I would believe it. Again, amazing job dude!!
“We are want that to happened but Omocat said NO” ;—;
Well yeah, the game would just be another rpgmaker game without it
That make Omori success because it help create a fandom
Wait, does that mean we can actually send OMOCAT messages through the shop? The possibilities…
Lmfao I love omocat, fucking amazing sense of humor
give us the omori drip omocat
A Minecraft YouTuber wanted to play the game, and people on Twitter started to refer to it as “able-ist” to stop him from playing it (when in reality omori is not about any physical/mental condition whatsoever), so omori fans fought back on Twitter and also kind of tried to gatekeep the game from mcyt, and a bunch of controversy regarding omocat was also brought up. Just badly dealt with by both sides of the drama
Isn't Omori about disassociative amnesia and depression though? Also yeah honestly fuck this community for harassing Ranboo into not playing it, I was genuinely looking forward to that after finishing the game myself
woah. i knew omocat was good at drawing. but wooah
He looks like he's having a mental breakdown. Also, I know we all know this but Omocat is so amazing at drawing.
That’s where Omocat’s from so it’s only natural
This is just as sad as the comic Omocat posted on twitter today, now my heart has been shattered twice on the same day, nice job OP!
this is such an honor to hear omfg !! thank you so much :D !!
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
Im not crying. . (AAAAAAAAAA WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY). . I said im not. *cries* . . I thought this was omocats comic before i saw the comments. This means high quality
aw thank you so much! :) its an honor!!!
the birthday comic omocat already made for his birthday made me sad enough already, but this made me cry even harder :,(
Omocat is definitely in on the joke
I’m so mad at omocat right now how could you give me so much gender envy I’m sad
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
I decided to redo it, a bit closer to the real thing by OMOCAT. if anyone wants them in high resolution, here it is: [
thanks couldnt find these anywhere
It's not actually in the game... but it is on Twitter if you wanna go digging through Omocat's page. (Or at least it was. No clue if it's still there) . . ... but they also had to say don't actually make it later, because it's apparently super gross, and people were making it as soon as the recipe was released. . . I don't remember it exactly, but it's like... Orange Fanta and... some kind of coffee.
Lol. No way!!!!
OMOCAT could be lurking in this very sub and we'd never know...

AYO OMOCAT WITH THE DRIPMORI?
This gave me the same feeling as Omocat's character birthday comics, I love it so much!
i hope omocat makes this canon
I mean, they’re from another Omocat comic right?
Yes
I wonder if that was an oversight by Omocat considering that doesn’t fit his personality at all lol. Or maybe it was supposed to be an ironic joke.
I feel like he just takes his jobs very seriously
OH THANK FUCK someone else said it. . Yeaaah that's exactly what I'm referring to. Way too close to home and while I don't think it was intentional on OMOCAT's part....it does seem a bit 'starts witn an N' parent-y. Again! Don't think it was intentional! But that combined with some things I've read about Favoritism and my own experiences.....it doesn't exactly make me feel good about her, personally.. . But because this game is told entirely through sprites and text, we will never know exactly how all that played out, so I prefer to not debate it with others. Just turns into a neverending argument, and I've had more than enough of those for one lifetime :')
Oh totally understandable, no worries! I super relate, there's peace in knowing when/how to choose your battles . . Definitely feel you on The Word™️ though lol, the dishes agreement thing was so real. I've done the same thing for my SG little sibling, the GC privilege comes in handy sometimes even if it comes with constant N smothering 🙃
Omgggggg yeah I- My situation is a bit different because I had it the other way around. I'm the youngest, the baby, but I was always the more academically interested/""gifted"" kid. Along with being the only one born female, it made her coddle me in ways she didn't do to my older brothers....but now we're essentially trapped in the same house together, neither of us pull our metaphorical punches, and we have mutual hatred so I went from being GC to SG 🙃. . That scene made me so uncomfortable, I was just yelling "yOU'RE A GROWN MAN, YOU'VE MOVED OUT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO A DAMN THING "
I heard Omocat's making one yeah, might be a scam though with how long it's taking
what the fuck is an omocat?
probably a gay feline idk man
> Within reported speech there is a shift in pronouns. First-person-pronouns are changed to third-person-pronouns.. . Why isn't it changed to "Who would be able to forgive you?". . >  I don't see how. All evidence points to what I said, and nothing to this conclusion.. . > You have to take authorial intent into consideration when OMOCAT puts lines such as this into the game.. . We don't know what Omocat's intent was. All we have is a few lines that read to me like he is in denial and knows deep down that Sunny did it.
The fans really weird me out.This is a game about loss, suicide, self acceptance, forgiveness and much more deep topics, yet people treat it as a disney cartoon fanbase. It's hard to take it seriously anymore. . Omocat isn't helping by becoming a vtuber....
Don't worry guys Omocat's gonna fix it. By adding more poles
I wish this was real,. . like omocat released a self parody
I mean, people still like, lined up heavily in Omocat booth in Animecon, it's definitely not dead
Is Omocat making more games?
Oh wow, a picture with two characters that look nothing like Aubrey and no actual proof of being official. Did Omocat even draw that? It's not her typical artstyle. And it's on twitter with 2 likes. Can't you send something that is actually outright Omocat?
Maybe, would be a weird thing for Omocat to do for representation though since Native Siberians are extremely rare in the United States (I mean I guess representation is supposed to be about minorities though so that would make sense from that perspective)
Sei lá, pergunta pra Omocat
I want to see more of this McAU
This isn't a McAU. This is McCanon
Item name: McG Uniform. . Item type: Charm. . Effects: +25 Juice, -50 Heart, -5 Speed, +10 Defense, +20 Attack. The wearer starts FURIOUS in battle.. . Description: A worker's uniform from the popular restaurant found all across Headspace, McGino's. You hear the silent screams of un-satisfied customers by simply looking at the attire.
Tagging it to see if it loads later
How did you get 20 upvotes tho
Why the fuck not
It's only a matter of time until a McFanfic is made about this.
Loving this.
You mean- “I’m loving it”
I'm Mclovin it
AYO!!! Thank you so much for this! ❤️
I'm fucking wheezing
This is delightful. Thank you for your service!
Question, where original post?
[McThank me later]()
I would be angry too if I was getting paid minimum wage and being treated like scum by both customers and higher ups. Does it sound like I am venting because I am venting.
getting devil is a Parttimer vibes
Didn't Omocat take some inspiration from this one for Omori?
This ship screams Shinji/Asuka to me, and well, Omocat is a fan of Evangelion, so the influence feels pretty intentional, imo.

what the hell
Amongus

Ok
where is this from
probably had a sleepover at one point before the incident? But this can be taken way out of context lmao
I dont even know what im saying anymore lmfaooo. . clown moment from me sorry 
oh lmao i was trying to say something like that but idk anymore 
No one in their right mind would play Bloons instead of BTD
nahh bruh lmfao
HEY IDK MAN  omocat just dropped this with no context whatsoever cut me some slack

When you outside
And you smell that **zaza**
You never visited your friend's house?
What friends?
Most likeable omori fan
The one's every human must have
Flair checks out
that completely straight moment when you're at a sleepover and instead of sleeping on the couch or floor you sleep in your homie's bed with him
He just like me fr
it’s only gay if you don’t wear socks
What if you wear stockings?
either 50x more gay or the average amount of gay, it depends on the person
What if it’s Santa
HoHoHomosexual. . 
I think this is pretty normal, my friends and I shared beds all the time at sleepovers
I'm convinced no one on this sub has friends lol.
Reddit moment
Yeah?

Gay

: Omori why are you upset? Can I not be a gay mf?
: No.
: Why not?
: Because I said so. >!And also because you killed him numerous times in BS.!<
: Technically you killed him. I just wanted him silenced. Not killed.
: You didn't specify.
Ah shit, here we go again

You ever had a sleepover dude?
I always sleep on the floor. 
I also find my best friend’s bed comfortable
Sleepover, presumably
Gay
Yeah 
I love that this thread is the only one without an argument in it.
There was a thread that was just meme roleplay
Are you trying to start an argument in this thread? 
. . i’ll show myself out 
This is the sacred thread
Or European?
When your parents can afford a nice comfy mattress but can’t afford to be with you for your childhood


He says the hospital is comfortable I think
Did you guys never try your friends beds when you went over 😵😵
What were sleepovers like
It’s a sleepover...
📸
 I just think it's comfortable okay? Nothing else.
bloons has been played
cope

Sleepover
childhood sleepovers.

And they were roomates.
fellas, is it gay to find your best friend's bed comfortable?
Fr though anyone has a theory for the symbolism behind this?
Aware of this. Was just wondering if some lore maniac has a cracked theory about this
bed comfy

oh god my dirty mind
THEYRE CHILDREN
Exactly what I’m thinking. They were like 12 before the incident, I highly doubt there was ever anything sexual between them.
exactly
[*ahem*]()
i did not want to think about it so cuz i knew they were children
because he is one of the few people who gave up sleeping on rocks
good bot
I love your pfp
Am I the only one who let my friends use my bed whenever they slept over?
I think he just tests every bed he comes in contact with

they cuddle on da bed yk
He did that minecraft thing where you can break into a villager's house, throw them out of their own bed and then sleep on it.
Click the citation.
He layed out on it?
SEGGS?!??!!!!1
They havent talked in 4 years meaning that they were 12. Kids. Children. Babies. I have high doubts
they are gay they are homosexual they cuddled on the bed
THEY ARE. . H O M O S E X U A L
Sorry but. . 
Once again i think people are just making stuff up in the comments. This whole sleepover notion is WILD to me. Yes they couldve had a sleepover but who tf ever sleot on the bed? I always slept either on a couch or the floor, never once on the be
is it really that weird to share a bed with your best friend at a sleepover? even if ur a guy (im a guy myself) when I was <12 id sleep in the same bed with my friend, I still have friends who are in college (tbf both girls) who sleep in each other's beds regularly. I guess it gets weirder when you're older but I always figured everyone at least tried it once when they were younger and you slept with someone of the opposite gender
I dont think ita weird i just domt see it as normal. It might just be my own like personal experience but i never slept in a homies bed at a sleep over andni feel like most of the time i also dont hear people sleeping in a bed. I mean weve seen 2 sleepovers in the game and both had no one else in a bed. Idk i could be wrong but i dont see it. Just like the handholding i just dont see it as something that happened or happens unless people are really close
Bruh, I’m (insert age lol) and I still sleep in my homies’ beds. Granted, I only regularly stay the night at one friend’s house, but still. He and I share the twin and just lay apart from one another. I despised laying on the floor as a little kid, couldn’t sleep, so he said “Oh, just come up here!”
Y’all it’s probably just a sleepover.. . I will not allow unnecessary gay shipping propaganda today lol
The gay agenda is stronger than you 


Where is this from?
The wiki

They probably sat on the bed and made flower crowns or something, whenever I had a play date I’d invite my friends to sit on the bed while we played games
when I have a sleepover with my BFF in his house he would always offer me his bed and gets a mattress and sleeps next to me. not that we are gay because we aren't( we are both straight) but come on. don't yall like to talk with your BFF all night before finally sleeping at 4am or 5am?

Does that mean he has been there before
I mean if you have a scanner you can get pretty close OMOCAT has shared pictures on how she does her art so we can see that she draws the image on paper scans it onto the computer and then draws over it digitally
I had the distinct feeling that Faraway is somewhere in America, not only because of the general "American suburb feel" including the Church, but because Omocat herself is asian-american.. . Plus none of the kids (including the other town kids) have distinctively japanese names.. . If they got legally in trouble they'd get sent to juvie, which seals those records upon turning 18.
are you omocat
No he ain't. . 
you ever think omocat regrets not having whites in the characters' eyes in-game cause everything she draws nowadays she puts those whites in i swear
>!If I'm right this may be because he moved on from his guilt in the good ending of the game (he gains the whites back when he wakes up from his fight w/ omori)!<
no what i'm talking about is the sclera.
I may be blind, my bad
1- yes  . 2- yes, OMOcat has been posting the chars in absolute drip on their birthdays on Twitter.
Please Omocat I love the plushies but I've already spent $400 on Omori merchh! my wallet is TOAST
Omocat used parasocial relationships! It was supper effective!

Where can I find it? It's not on Omocats website ;-;
She revealed it on her twitter, like with the official omori plush. I assume they aren’t for sale **yet**
omocat out here hitting moving attacks right in the heart of my wallet
Omocat twitter
😕 I don't twitter oh no
Yeah, it's because these are OMOCAT's OC'S 
between basil, aubrey and charleen (off the top of my head), omocat really likes her queer subtext that isn't even remotely subtle but still just unclear enough that fans get annoyed if you treat it as fact. . way i see it, anyone that thinks this is tumblr-level reaching is forgetting that omocat is the author of stuff like Pretty Boy and therefore just as tumblr-brained as the rest of us. it's AT LEAST intended as a possible interpretation
true! by the way, what's the queer subtext with charlene?  i don't think ive heard of that one.
i get some strong semi-closeted trans girl vibes from her, with the way she's shy about doing more feminine stuff she likes and the fact that her name is something of a secret between her family and close friends. reads like a kid at the stage of transition where shes comfortable opening up to people she trusts but not quite enough to go public with it
ohh yeah true
It's more plausible that this character is some Omocat self insert or another OC. The only thing it has in common with Aubrey is the handkerchief bow, the clothes and even the size of her hair is different. But Omocat usually draws herself as having that kind of bow as well (just see Artist, her self insert in the game) so...
Yeah, you "personally" don't, but others do. Unless it's confirmed by Omocat, you can just speculate and have fantasies about it.
perosonally isn't a word?
typos exist.
thank you, i never would've guessed! time to go back to my medieval house
Pointing out one of my spelling mistakes and acting all snarky isn't going to prove your original argument.
well, i like being snarky, and you haven't been showing any disposition to change your mind, or to listen at all.
Well, you can continue being snarky all you like, but why would I change my mind? I will change my mind once you show me proof instead of just speculation and fantasies. Plus, what is there to listen to? Listen to your snarky remarks and not try to prove your original argument?
so you're not on board? that's fine, genuinely. if neither of us is getting anything out of it we can just end this discussion.
Wasn't on board from the start.
then why would you comment. anyways, let's just end it here.
To answer your question? You're the one that asked, "So you're not on board?" and all I did was answer it. You didn't even have to reply to my comment. All you had to do was end it.
that was never stated by omocat, actually. just tiktok speculation
. . I did it I have become super shipper. . Omocat thanks for the power!
and that statement is based on what? they're all made by omocat, so why wouldn't they be? i believe in canon until proven otherwise, personally.
There is literally no proof for canon so why would you state it as canon?. There is no need to prove otherwise since it wasn't canon in the first place
again, what's the proof it isn't?
Any positive assertion must be backed up by proof. . . For example, saying "unicorns exist" isn’t as true as saying "unicorns do not exist". The burden of proof falls on you to prove that they do exist. In this case, it is normal to assume it’s not canon because it was never claimed by Omocat to be canon. In this case, you would have to prove that Omocat did, in fact, declare this as canon.
let's do this again: the creator does not mean to explicitly state something for it to be canon. that's just bad writing.
Ofc they have, if it's not hinted anywhere nor said anywhere that this would be canon, then it's not canon. That's it and there's no more to it. You can support this ship ofc but it is not canon
Omocat based by fueling the shipping community
In any other case I would agree that the lights going out is just another way of saying the power in general, but since the power apparently didn’t go out then in this case I think only the lights being specified is important to note.. . I do agree though that it’s not realistic for a power company to only turn your lights off. So I basically just assume that they either had a backup generator that we don’t see, or for whatever reason power companies do work like that in this universe. It is possible to lose only your lights during a power outage so maybe omocat thought that would apply here too
>A partial power outage is a problem with the home's electrical system. . Well I shouldn't have said power outage, I meant like a tripped breaker or something. . >Mind you, lights often share circuits with the outlets in your home, so the idea of just the lights being off but the outlets working fine is strange (unless the electricians in your house decided to put all the lights on separate circuits, which would be odd.). . I'm not an expert but I have tried to research this before and i think this is how it's commonly done in some places, but it does vary a lot.

Jesus, this looks so good
This looks incredible, we don't deserve Omocat!
Look at the window edge
Omori plush
love this!
There’s something *behind* the window
She always does the best artwork!
Joined. Don't know what its about. Anyway any news on asti and astr?

Amazing work I gave silver
Hat ghosts are there too
this art is beautiful :)
:D
When console release
For the uninitiated:. . 
>!huh. so this would be her future if the accident never happened.!<
[Wait, what?]()
I immediately thought of that lol
Plastic Love referance?
Indeed
IT’S REAL. . RIGHT FROM OUR LORD AND SAVIOR OMOCAT
this looks like something you would actually find in a second-hand store.
looks like OMOCAT is a woman of culture because plastic love by mariya takeuchi is a banger
No way 😖. Depression album 😫
SHES SO PRETTY ASJIDASUIFZSDF HIUADSLx
plastic love all of a sudden???
OH MY GOD I LIVE THIS SO MUCH IM GONNA IDE
awesome!
This is beautiful!
OH MY GOS I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
This didn't just make my day, it made my entire month. Absolutely stunning
YES
h
omocat UPDATING omori? IMPOSSIBLE!!
I mean, the switch/console versions of the game are basically just an updated version of the game, am I wrong?
Wtf omocat
it's to incentivize ppl to go back to console gaming so devs and game comms aren't so segregated. Then everyone can get every game instead of being left out just bc they don't have a $1,000+ PC for steam and mods :3c. . (I completely pulled this outta my ass, but it's a nice thought)
I agree. I'd absolutely love it if Omocat and team make a new game, but I'd rather it be something completely different than Omori's universe if they do. Omori doesn't feel like it has any room for expansion in sequel material
The Omori Game Twitter account has never posted art or merchandise though. That’s always either OMOCAT’s account or a specific Omori Merch account.
To the many people saying it might be merch, The OMOCAT twitter usually posts merch news, and OMORI game is more-so about the Game, hence the name. This, combined with the Album with spooky ambiance being posted to the OMORI spotify, makes me think this is going to be a scarier sequel.
fuckass japan exhibition
OMOCAT works fast… but OMORI fans work faster.
considering the 2 different camera angles of the same place, it's probably an image omocat/her team took themselves
That’s what I was thinking as well
It’s probably a house in whatever town Omocat lives/lived in when she was making omori
That such a cool figure tho wish I could buy it from OMOCAT shop or something… def gonna be like 294829839238 million hundred dollars tho 😭😰😰😰
gotta whip out the omori credit card
Doesn't Omocat call Omori that on occasion?
I have a feeling Omocat didn’t have the DSM-5 open while playing the game. He is what he is and you can go with whatever head canon you like
Hmmmmm. It's possible!! Even IF it wasn't intended by omocat, it's still a headcanon that has enough evidence to be true!! So I personally believe it.
I don't know if he was written with such a diagnosis in mind, but he clearly has many traits that one might identify as autistic. . So, in terms of writing from OMOCat, I have no clue. . In terms of whether or not the argument can be made, 100%. Is he autistic? I don't know, haven't gotten the chance to ask. . Does he express traits commonly in like with autismic people? Absolutely. . . I also, as an autist, found him incredibly relatable. I liked this tiny hair beast. I am possibly biased. . . So, um, if there was a poll of yes or no, my vote would go in yes. Just because the character can be easily identified as autistic, which is the (i assume) definition of "autism coded."
. . this drawing omocat did. I just love it so much
. . definitely this 2nd anniversary art from official Omocat twitter! i could stare at it in awe for hours<3
this type of collage art is fascinating for unrelated reasons. if anything were to move, everything else in the picture would fall into chaos. you dont even have to touch nothin;if time simply flowed normally, omori would close his eyes, hit his head on the transparent stairs violently, fall, and know his friends will be here soon. E:oops I tried to use returns now my thoughts are a run on sentence
ARTIST is omocat the creator of Omori itself...now everything makes sense
What if OMOCAT made herself in the game?. She's an artist too
Omocat should really say it then if it is
True
Omori is confirmed to be real and living in omocats house
And is probably having a good time there.
On the Omocat store it says shipment for the physical copies won't start until June 17th
I REALLY hope the digital version comes very soon. I have been dying to finally get my hand on Omori and I don't care whether it is digital or not, I want it! I hope it is at least early or mid spring.
Yup? I am as well! Just explaining how I'm very excited in general
I doubt it though
Nothing wrong with hoping
Yeah
I'm not really sure so correct me if i'm wrong. . But  [this link]() seems to imply that Omocat could do it for free with a program
On YouTube, the OMOCAT channel
Agreed, like he's the opposite of your standard blank protagonist. The whole game is practically the player discovering who he is lol 😅. Weird choice by omocat
This is real! OMOCAT posted it on her Twitter and other platforms: 
It is real, the Omocat store just recently sent out an email on it.
It was posted on all of Omocat’s socials! Here is the Twitter link: 
Check Omocat’s Twitter.

Thank you!
I really cant wait for them to be released, but I hope Omocat will also stock up on the Headspace plushies, i need omor ahhh
Well, it's based on an indie game by Omocat, based on *the* indie game by Omocat would make you wonder about the indie game referenced.. . If *Omori* was written on the description, then it could have been "based on the indie game Omori, by Omocat".

The point is that the description does not tell you what indie game the product based on, so it is correct to say "based on an indie game", instead of "based on the indie game".
Yes, and you're still missing the point that, in a vacuum, on its own the description does not address which indie game we're talking about.. . Also it does not imply that Omocat has multiple games, the "an" is reliant to "indie game", not to "Omocat", so she can have one game and the phrase is still correct.
Omocat please just tell us the price I'm begging you 
I want to know how screwed I am
@OMOCAT Will there be Real World plushies?
I said fuck it and went to buy it and the $5 shipping price changed to $55-. . . Sorry OMOCAT but you are on CRACK if you think I'm paying that hell nahhh
I just want the artbook  I don't care about the official walkthrough, why would they bundle it together? It will hurt the sales anyways with the insane pricing.
They’re following the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack model by bundling DLC so they can sell the pack for a extra $30.
Right? And yet she'll still make tons of sales anyway! Her prices are crazy but her loyal fans are even crazier.
Collectionists 
I am really hoping that this was an accident and this isn’t the actual price because is this is this is absolutely ridiculous. I do have mad respect for Omocat But if this is the price I feel like she should be ashamed because this is just fucking ridiculous and this is just gouging money out of her hard-core fans
Exactly.. I understand that indie game merchandise can be a bit expenditure as it takes tons of effort and money for the indie game developers to create such products,. but $70 for an art book is just stupid.. I think omocat went a bit greedy with this one…
especially considering Omocat (the company not the person) is a literal merch studio so it's less hard for them to do it
I would have understood if it costed 30 USD, that is expensive but understandably so to an extent.
"This can't be good for me, but I feel **GREAT**!". . \- OMOCAT
I really really really really hope that this was a mistake and at first I thought it might’ve been but after hearing some of the other stuff Omocat did I’m doubting it
Was really looking forward to this but guess I won't buy it anymore unless something's changed but doubt it
Yeah exactly the same here
Not a mistake, I sent omocat an email and they said it’s so expensive because it weighs ~2.26kg and they’re using a courier company. Kinda bummed cuz I was looking forward to it but I’m thinking I might cancel my preorder because I can’t really justify the $182 aud even if it was my parents buying it for me
Also I acknowledge it was irrational to buy it in the first place but I was really excited and just was Not Thinking but after thinking about it logistically. Man
I just can’t believe it and yeah this is major major bullshit I really hope the team realizes they’re mistake and fixes it but after seeing some of the other similar shit that Omocat has done it’s probably not gonna happen
Yeah Omocat seems to do that like how when they had that poster sized artwork for the anniversary of Omori and it also came with a bunch of small art work cards, it feels like it's only done to force the price to go up.
That’s just kind of some shady bullshit lol. . I really looked up to her I don’t know how to feel right now I don’t know I might be over thinking this because it’s almost 2 AM where I live
Yeah I really enjoy Omori but how the Omocat store is run not so much, my biggest issues is the wait times as my one order took 3 months and I'm also not a fan that pre-orders are charged the day of the transaction. Like today I was charged for the book when it's not releasing until the end of this year. Also not the biggest fan of how radio silent Omocat can be like recently with the whole situation of the game not releasing digitally in parts of the world and not on ps at all, and they didn't make any statements about it until it actually released and they said it was now live which was annoying since the day before they tweeted about the game being on sale on steam
>my order to 3 months. . Same thing happened to me but it almost took a year had to contact support too 
Geez that’s awful customer service
Just want to add to this that my order took basically 5 months (A YEAR THOUGH!? I THOUGHT MY EXPERIENCE WAS BAD).
maybe probably because I’m shipping internationally but I felt like they almost forgot my order since after I contacted customer service the merch came to me in 2-3 months
That would not be fun especially with how their customer service is known to suck
If I can recall they would always answer a week after I sent an email and I really dislike wait for that long
Yeah that's quite the long gap between your email and theirs
I didn’t actually hear about most of that stuff but yeah kind of fucked people have been waiting to be able to play your game for like ever and you aren’t even going to give them a reason to why they may have to wait longer like what the fuck I don’t even know anymore I’m so fucking tired
It was the same story with the release of the actual game. I haven't been part of the fandom for THAT long, but I know that Omori used to be kickstarter project and that Omocat received way much more money than the actual goal. She (allegedly) acted the same way back then and rarely ever updated the community about the progress of the game, people were pissed and even wanted a refund on their donations.
Wow and I assumed she became like this because of getting a big ego from giant success from her game but no she’s actually just kind of a bitch to be honest wow I’m kind of shocked right now like genuinely for a while she’s been my role model just wow like I don’t even know anymore but thank you for bringing this information to my attention
Yeah, I was shocked as well and still kinda am. It's a shame because Omori is such a charming game that has a special place in my heart. I would have never thought that someone who created such a cute game could be like this.. . I was also a fan of Omocat's art because I generally like cutesie "weeb" stuff and just like her drawing style. I think this is a case of "You can still love their work but not be a fan of them as a person", though it's up to you if you want to keep supporting the artist or not.. . I guess what we can learn from this is to not put people on a pedestal, especially those you don't know in real life.
I mean… she’s not THAT bad??? like i’ve seen people who’ve done way worse than just not update people on a kickstarter and not be called that much horrible of a person
No one said it's the worst thing a person could ever do, but it's still kinda shitty and worth criticizing, isn't it? Especially if the Kickstarter goal was 20.000$ and they earned 200.000$ it should be a given to not make your supporters feel like you left them hanging.
Really a lot of assuming goin around without actually knowing the truth
Wasn't it priced at $143 as a reference to the motif/arc number in omori?
Honestly at this is kind of money gouging because I know that there is Super fans who have been there from the beginning who will pay that and it’s just sad why the hell would Omocat do this?
She likes money.. . Really there is no other reason for it.
Yeah since I said that I definitely realized that :(. . I guess I’m just kinda surprised because I had this image of it Omocat in my head but in the past hour and a half it’s completely shifted all at once so I don’t really know how to feel right now lol
She's always been a little sketchy.
I am kind of wishing I didn’t just learn this now because this was kind of a shock for me but hey what can you do about it. . Edit: I meant I wish I learned the information sooner not that I didn’t learn it at all lol
Yeah, and unfortunately she just continues. At this point, she could price something thousands of dollars and it would be sold-out within a few days lol. She knows her fanbase and how to use them.
Do you know what I think we need to at least try to show her that she can’t do just do this because if she gets away with this she’s just gonna keep doing it Like I just think we need to do something about it but I don’t know what
let's be honest you'd do the same thing
Not really
Yes really, if you made a game that took years to make, you're gonna want to profit off of it. I don't support the price and I honestly think it's outrageous that the shipping is that much, but stop acting like you'd take the moral high ground.
I am not saying that i wont profit off of it but I wont sell my game merchandise at 400% the price of the game. Its not about moral high ground but rather the ridiculous amount for an art book.
I don't think it's all her decision. It's not like she's the only person running the whole store. There is going to be 3rd parties and other's. It's too early to judge when we don't know the whole deal.
I don't think it's all her decision. It's not like she's the only person running the whole store. There is going to be 3rd parties and other's. It's too early to judge when we don't know the whole deal.
A. How did you not have that image of her before?  She's always been greedy.. . B. Why is it bad to be greedy?  She made a great game and wants money.  Selling it for a high price means she'll sell less, but each is worth more.  She may actually make less money from these books than if she sold them for less.  Plus when the books stop being sold it means there will be fewer out in the world, making them more valuable as collectibles.
If she might make less money from these books than if she sold them for less, why not just sell them for less? Being greedy isn't necessarily a good personality trait and shows Omocat's character. Sure, she wants money, I get it, but that price isn't justified regardless. . Yes she made a great game, but I doubt the art book is actually worth 70 or even 40 dollars. Charging every non-US customer additional 55 bucks for shipping is just vile.
Charging 55 for shipping is more likely an industry thing.  It could have to do with publishing rights, manufacturing rights, etc.  International shipping is always very messy in any field, which is why you see companies that have multiple entities for each area.  For example, Nintendo of America is a different company from Nintendo.  Unfortunately OMOCAT is not quite large enough to have an OMOCAT Europe or something.. . Regardless, I understand your frustration about not being able to afford something you want, but anyone should know the argument "why would someone make more money when they can just make less?" is pretty silly.. . As for hurting her character, I don't think that really matters.  It's very unlikely - both statistically and based on what we know about OMOCAT - that she will ever make another game or big project of any worth or fame.  So if she can squeeze more money out of us, then why wouldn't she?
Well I didn't say "why would she make more money if she can just make less", what I meant is that she could even sell more and potentially make more money if she sold it for a little less, because more people would buy it, which is the same thing you said in your previous comment.. Yeah the weird thing is that shipping is only that high for this particular order, but not for any of the other products. Idk, just doesn't seem to make sense if you charge the same for shipping from US to Canada as from US to Germany. I've ordered books from small creators from the other side of the world and never had to pay THAT much for shipping. Maybe like 20 bucks was the most I had to pay plus import duty.. . I get that people like money, everyone does and sure, if you have the opportunity to make more, you take it. It's just that you still have to stay kinda reasonable with your pricing to not fuck over your customers and the fanbase that's been supporting you and your project for years. . . I was fine with paying 70 bucks for this, maybe even more, but what's overkill is the thought that every non-US customer has to pay pretty much the same price on top of that just so it can be shipped over to them (import duty included).. Either way, of course in the end everyone has to decide by themselves if they want to buy it. But in my opinion, greediness can only be justified so far. There's a point where it's just getting ridiculous.
This
I mean, she is rich. That's the sale number only for Steam. I know that the game was a huge hit on the Switch in Japan. Also we don't talk about all the merch lol. I'm really dissapointed that the guide + art book is not at least available in pdf format on Steam.. . 
na there’s something more to it, prolly expensive asf to make and took a long time idk, you’d make more money having it at a price of 50 otherwise
I think it's because she wants/needs money, I hope this didn't turn into a situation where you rely on OG fans to get money, I mean OMOCAT is not like that, right? 
I don’t think she needs money because of the price of merchandise it’s a bit more on the expensive side but not unreasonable and it’s shown that like 70% of game profits are from merchandise
It's not that far off to think that OMOCAT is actually like that, unfortunately...
I unfortunately have to agree to this, as we share the same thoughts, but I still believe in her.. (a bit)
~~i too believed into putin a bit as a russian until he declared war~~
That's very fucking expensive, I'm from overseas and some of the things that i ordered from omocat shop i had to pay for customs since they don't add taxes for people that are not from america, so imagine paying 70$ + shipping + customs, Kind of bullshit if you ask me
Even for us in Canada it ends up being $160 . (About $123 USD)
man, that's fucked up, I don't remember if they are doing it but they atleast gotta give a discount if you surpass a certain ammount of price on the purchase, and i mean a REALLY GOOD discount
I agree!. . The closest thing they have to that is if you spend over US$150 on one order then you get free shipping
Only in the US apparently
Wait actually? How the fuck? Just how? WOOOOOOOOW OMOCAT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
Yeah shipping there is usually $10 (I just ordered some stuff) so yeah it’s like $80 in all
OK I fucking pray that this price and the shipping price was an accidental accident and not on purpose because holy shit that’s like the same price as the item itself
I doubt it was but I guess all we can do is hope because I know damn well I’m not getting it
This is just so stupid like just why literally this whole situation could’ve been avoided if the art book and the guidebook were separate but then of course if they were separate then who the fuck would buy the guidebook
The guidebook is kinda useless like it doesn’t come with the game you have to pay $80 more for it (4 times more than the game on steam) who is the guidebook for, I doubt anyone will use it to help them
But I mean it’s kinda not out of the unexpected:/ a lot of stuff in there is pretty pricey
Yeah other than for like nostalgia for guidebooks sake I don’t see why anyone would buy it but the art book on the other hand I mean who wouldn’t want it one of the most praised things about this game is it’s amazing art also like we have the Internet so we don’t really need guidebooks anymore lol
Yeah it’s only for the novelty
In my opinion I feel like what should’ve been done is that she should’ve done a pre-order and then based on the results of how many pre-orders they got after that they make the amount of extra after pre-order based on the amount of pre-orders because if that was the way they did it it would’ve mostly been best so everyone could get what they want
Yeah
Why do you think omocat has any say in shipping costs dgkjdkhgd
Yeah that’s a valid point it’s just that a lot of the time I have seen people selling stuff online try to trick you by having a really high shipping price but yeah you could be right because shipping has been super expensive lately because of gas prices and Covid stuff and all that
As if there isn't a less pricy option, come on...
Omocat be like: Funni number go brrr
I can see the complaints about the shipping costs, 55 dollars for shipping is quite extreme, but the price for a 350 page hardcover art book is going to be pretty steep. I've seen others of smaller size go for a similar price, and they weren't hardcover!. . It's also irksome seeing all the armchair analysts arguing and feeding into each other about how "wow Omocat must be so greedy, they're a giant bitch, sucks to have found out this way" as though a mildly expensive art book is somehow a reflection of their character and worth dragging them for. Even if you find it excessively priced, assuming a whole bunch of shit about them is just uncalled for.
It's disappointing how entitled some people here sound yikes. I collect artbooks and this price isn't too far from the usual price for its size. A ffxiv artbook ,usually 300 pages, goes for $40, but it's cheaper because of Square Enix's sheer resources for mass production. The 300 page Granblue Fantasy artbooks go for like $50-60.. . I do agree the shipping is weirdly pricey tho. . I don't want to know what these people would insult an artist with after seeing how high commission prices or handmade goods go for.
Yeah I agree completely. The shipping cost for some books is kinda wack, but the price point is reasonable, especially if you look at it as a sort of “collectible” instead of just “some Omori books”. They are softcover though, jsyk
Oh, they're softcover? I saw someone mention hardcover. Either way, 70 dollars for a 350 page artbook isn't exactly super unexpected. I've seen books half that size for 50 bucks at places, so it's really not as crazy as people are making it out to be.
Yeah I completely agree
@ the fact that it costs so much you're given the option to pay a fucking art book in installments. Omocat's really trying to cash in.
I mean I guess they are at least interest free I guess lmfao
Oh my God I didn’t notice that. . The fuck
Everything on omoshop has that for some reason. Even the cheapest items lol
I've bought a few Omocat things from Aus and the shipping is always ridiculous and takes months to arrive, on top of the high price of the stuff. I've ordered the book but did so in a rush and I'm not sure I can really justify it to myself the more I stop and think about it.
Yeah I guess we’re just gonna have to wait and see what comes of this and I definitely don’t want Omocat to get hurt or anything but I do want her to see everyone’s points
Omocat is high on orange joe
Well, we're basically paying for 2 books, all fully illustrated by OMOCAT, that are 300+ pages in total. I don't it's that unreasonable of a price.
Omocat probably just wanted to make a 69 joke. Unfortunately, my wallet doesn't find it funny.
We shouldnt rly get that angry and saying omocat is greedy when most of these art books are 70$ so thats a standard. I get it if 55$ dhipping bugs u yeah its pretty fucking stupid. But 70$ is normal pricing exspeacially for an indie studio.
Agree with you on that one but I guess it is what it is then. Really hope Omocat will sell them separately soon to save a buck or two
Am I one of the crazy ones that bought this? Got it for my wife as an early gift, she's been following omocat since their inception. But damn this is pricey as hell.
Nah you’re not crazy, I just ordered one too. It didn’t gouge me on shipping like some other people, so imo the price wasn’t too bad
the first thing i thought of when i saw the price was the post on her twitter talking about how omocat is a team of over a dozen people. i see this as more of an expensive fan item to help pay for things while they work on other stuff
At this point I'm wondering if Omocat made the physical release only $35 on accident.
I think it mostly depends on the website and the quality but i don't think OMOCAT has no control over the pricing, atleast from my experience
Why the hell is it $70?? That's crazy expensive and I live in the UK and I can determine that no matter the quality an OFFICIAL Walkthrough and Artbook should NOT cost that much.. . OMOCAT we all love you but this is just out of hand..
Very very true I don’t know what to say that hasn’t already been said but just why
Probably the reason they’re “overly” expensive is because if they were “reasonably priced” then scalpers would end up buying like half of the stuff and selling it for double the price. Omocat (or let’s be honest some third party probably ) choosing a high enough price stops scalpers from buying out the merch since there would be few people willing to pay for a double increase. Any profit a scalper would make would be minimal, and not worth it.. . That’s my theory anyways. The price doesn’t seem awful to me, although a bit pricy. Considering how rabid Omori fans buy out the merch, I wouldn’t be surprised if there have been cases of scalping. If anyone has any knowledge let me know!
I'm sorry but this is not an absurd price for a high quality art book. OMOcat is allowed to price her art as she sees fit.
Personally, for me, shipping+taxes is an extra 17 dollars, I'll be willing to buy it, but it should of 100% been two separate books for 35 each at the bare minimum and fix the damn shipping problems omocat
Literally my first thought. Watch omocat drop NFTs next
Lol. . I am so glad those things are finally starting to fall off though but if she did start selling NFTs I would just be completely done with everything to do with her lol
Ive already probably racked up 100$ worth of merch but the book price is still absurd. Pretty certain it is the most expensive item too haha
It is very easily the most expensive item on the Omocat shop not even just in Omori but like in general
Really. What the fuck. I love the game and the art but when regular mainland US shipping tacks 12 dollars onto a 70 dollar art book plus another 4 dollar tax, I'll just be forced to find some other media to be inspired by. I love Omocat and her creation but this is an injustice to the franchise. We really need to say something about this!
Honestly I agree, omocat really soared too high on this one. The game isn’t even that hard that can help anyone that is a diehard fan anyway. They’ll just see things they already knew in the first place. It’s really absurd and I am glad more people think so.
Say what you will about omocat, her roots as a fashion designer are very apparent when she drops new omori merch.
Oh here we go again with people not reading comments and just assuming things. Haven't seen this before!. . I'll say this one more time and one more time only. I do not want shit for free. I am frustrated because rather than fix the wrong she has done over the past YEARS, she releases a new product. Do a google search on their shipping problems. People waited months, I think I even saw over a year before, for them to ship their purchases and it never happened. People have emailed them with objectively reasonable questions and never gotten answers. I personally spent almost 100 Dollars on their shop on a few shirts, and the prints on them cracked literally before I could even wear them. I have 10 year old shirts that cost half what Omocat's shirts cost that look brand new. . . I'm complaining about their business practices as a whole. The fact that they charge what they're charging, for the products they're selling, rather than fix the wrongs they've committed, is what pisses me the fuck off. It's unacceptable.. . So you're right I'm not being personally fucked over because I don't like her prices. I'm being personally fucked over because I PAID her prices and received shit tier garbage. And I'm not the only one.
I'm an artist, OMOCAT is one of my favorite artists, Omori is fucking phenomenal, I'd pay with my kidney for Omori merch. I have a problem.
Knowing Omocat she probably said 'haha 69 funny" or something
OMOCAT is a comedy Genius
Probably not, since hector already has his plushie on OMOCAT's shop
Theres a hector plush?
It's called going outside and putting a face on a smooth stone
The comment above is correct
I have a burning need for this. Damn omocat boutt to do a wallet biopsy on my ass. x.x
Omocat just making anything at this point 💔
Can’t wait to drive my omori theme wrapped car to the omori art exhibition to then pay for it with my omori credit card, can’t forget i have my omori shirt and perfume on, don’t forget about the omori plushies waiting for me back home on my omori pillows, then after a full day i can finally use my omori lubricant🥰

Omocat is a greedy bitch, what can I say
True true omocat is making anything for a bit of money now like we don’t need perfume bro like give us an omori anime instead of perfume
Atp there will be forests, streets and a private military owned by omocat😭
Omocat doing literally anything but make another game (please please OMORI was peak I need another game from the goat please I beg of you)
I swear all OMOCAT ever does with OMORI now is just merch that can sometimes be low quality or weird collabs no one cares about
I mean, there's not much she can do, it's a complete story. . . ...Unless she gets a fever a has a dream
and dreams of an ending so inspiring that she would even want the world to see it
Omocat greed
its scary seeing people ship kids.. . I mean, theres already lots of evidence that OMOCAT loves shotas and still defends it to this day so im more so scared that their idealogies are rubbing off on other people's surreptitiously.
Omocat also ‘ships children.’ Why dont ya go whine at her too?
Imagine coping with your trauma so hard that you actually envision yourself as another boy coping with different traumas.
Literally me
Don’t call me out like that

Hello charlotte be like
Fucking banger of a story too, everyone who liked OMORI should play it.

Ok so fuck me right.

this is literally what i do
that’s literally me (im a girl btw)

Omocat: real world plushies gonna be real in 2030 and the only canon ship in the game is kim x aubrey ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|trollface)

Idk why but seeing Kim just makes my blood boil a bit
Maybe it's the "yee yee as haircut" she has
Omocat based for that one frfr 
We have hidden a toblerone somewhere. Find it and you can change anything to be canon.
That wouldn’t ruin the game, that would ruin people’s lives.
NO
Why was the first person I thought of Todd Howard
I thought of J. K. Rowling
it just works man
Just her announcing there'd be another game as a continuation
Mark as spoiler bro 
A bit too late for that looks like
Was a pretty big spoiler, probably a good thing mods dealt with it

oh my god

yikes
Please tell me those screenshots are photoshopped. . . I’m running out of copium.
As someone who was around at the time and actually saw those personally, no they are not.. . Omocat was called out multiple times for her weird obsession for over merchandise of -you know what-. The shirt thing was just the biggest one.. . I'd like to believe she has changed after so many years since it seems like she has kinda got over that but I may be on copium too.
Source?
“All shipping is wrong and stupid they are all children remember”
I hope Omocat would twete that.
People are like "omg, if a ship is confirmed this game is ruined for me" nah bruh it isn't, shut yo bitch ass up. I think there is a way to ruin it a little but idfk...
This is fake, right?
its been great and im so glad youve all enjoyed rhe game but i think its time to say goodbye to omori
Alongside a picture of Omor plush being held >!over the edge of a tall building!<

"\[Insert one of the actually cursed ships like >!Sunset!<\] is canon". . I can only imagine the chaos, especially on twitter 
Reactions to the ending
"YIIK: A Post-Modern RPG is now Omori 2"
"How everyone reacted to the truth is ".
Todd Chavez? What is this, a crossover episode?
This is the real January 6 riot
anything depicting what happened after the good ending. 1. the speculation is fun and calls for characters analysis's, which i love. 2. knowing what happens after the true good ending defeats the whole purpose of the game. in the sense of the purpose of the game, what happens after "doesnt matter"
"the bad ending is the true ending"
The console esclusive content will not come to steam, cope and buy the game again
or add a mod that adds the exclusive content
New omori NFTs
*Now I know that it was quite confusing, but the good ending isn't the Canon one. The Canon ending is actually the neutral ending!*

i know but i was too lazy
its there
hello i am omocat and i like little boys
I support 18+ Omori art  . (I can already hear the mods coming.)

Ah yes, OMORI 2.0 where the entirely of adventure is real and not a dream but ending isn't.
"None of you have found the actual canon ship yet. Keep looking, I'll tell you when you get it right."
I CRACKED IT! THE PRETTY BOY AND THE JOCK
them telling the fan base to stop shipping same gender x same gender cuz they're homophobic. most of the omori fandom are mentally ill queer teens sooo
 omocat said what
"Omori 2 will be released as a Pachinko machine"
bring back her old deleted tweets
"We are pleased to announce an animated film based on the events of Omori by partnering with Illumination Entertainment."
"i like children". . &#x200B;. . 👮‍♂️:🤨
"*controversial ship* is canon."
More jumpscare and more trolls than just the bears
We all know what I’m thinking 😈😈😈😈😈
TODD
damn, diddnt thought about that
Sequel kind of implies official content not mods, I don't have anything against mods but it's very different a fan making something and omocat making something
oh yeah, true. . sorry
Very bold of Omocat to make the official statement . . That gay boy couples CAN have kids.. . YES WE CAN. 👏👏👏👏👏👏


 I forgor the truth
Fogori 
Maybe, without a confirmation from Omocat we can't say 100%. Im sure they prefer to keep a lot of things unconfirmed to leverage imagination
cumspace . . contacting omocat to name it like this rn
no that's omoriboy's space
Omocat I don't feel so good.
I would've totally bought those
Well that hit harder than any poetry book could.

Well fuck now you spoiled the game for me

Bro spoiler this shiz
terrible manager i would have instantly bought these
there probably were different reasons
Is it possible to fire another person's manager?
thats called aggravated arson /j
Curse you, OMOCAT's manager! I wanted a THE MAVERICK T-Shirt!
oh but they approved the body pillow stuff?
noo i want those
those would have sold infinitely better then they thought they would
Isn't Omocat her own manager?
That’s what I was wondering as well
I would have bought the first one I’m sad
I wouldve totally bought it and would wear it every day.
why do people have managers how does this happen
No bc I would spend all of my college funds on those

THOSE WOULDVE BOMBED LMAO
DAMN YOU OMOCAT'S MANAGER
Wtf omocat
i would’ve bought the one on the bottom. . . edit cuz i wrote buyed instead of bought for some reason?? i’m fluent in english idk how
This was on [Omocat’s Twitter](), as well as her other socials!
Hehe is an onomatopoeia of a laugh, so in this case omocat is laughing
I think omocats planning world domination
Plot twist: She already has her plans of world domination set up. By the simple press of a button, she will take over the world before you can blink. It's too late, there is no stopping her.
oh shit lmao
It's a statement against NFTs. By "Hehe", Omocat expresses the ridiculousness and the absurdity of the situation. The tweet is probably minted to express a form of irony shared among the millennials and gen Z against boommers... Wow
Yo Socrates it's a fucking random tweet
omg you really did take my comment at face value hahahah
OMOCAT: hehe.. . Me: ಠಿ\ಠ. .. ...what the?.
Omocat is becoming Omori.
[Omocat vs the omori fandom rn]()
Well then Omocat is just laughing at us
Omocat is omocat.
Just press “Translate Tweet,” Twitter offers OMOCAT to English translations now
Omocat now legally owns my soul
They didn’t, but when they restocked back in like January you could also preorder them as well. . As for notifications I get email notifications from the Omocat shop
Oh OK I'm gonna sign up for that then
Frozen take: I don’t think Omori is coming out, I’m pretty sure Omocat took the money and ran.
GUYS, HE’S STUCK IN 2017 , WE NEED TO GET HIM OUT 
I'm glad I didn't even know about it till December 21
I didn’t even need to pay for it by the time I played it!
I know right! And the trailer looked so cool..
>For one they aren't even canon, but that's an entirely different can of worms.. . İ am not believe these are written for nothing. İ believe OMOCAT want us to find like this.
I'll just leave a link to one of my older comments here, since I'm honestly tired of repeating the exact same argument like a broken record:. . 
yes. i guess omocat forget that
I’ve gone ahead and sent Omocat’s team a message, thank you for bringing this to our attention. . . . Edit: I’ve heard rumors that people are sending the creator hate mail, to the extent of death threats. I do not believe I need to remind you all to be civil, while someone’s work can be criticized and even reported for copyright infringement, we do NOT tolerate bullying/harassment, especially death threats, so please, do not go after the creator in this way, or really any other purely malicious way.
Doing god's work 
although i agree its a ripoff, saying they "copy the content warning" feels weird when that's just the standard template for a content warning.
How come so many people decide that when someone does something illegal or just scummy, people decide to send death threats? It's kinda stupid
It’s messed up
Twitter
I know right? It istantly makes them pass to the wrong
>a captivating 2D Maze Game that will transport you to a world of intricate puzzles and immersive exploration. . literally just a black and white maze with absolutely nothing in it
Nothing truly deserves death threats. . \*sees some fan games of other games\* Ok, *Not many* Things deserve death threats. . (Sidenote: I understand I shouldn't be making a joke about this, But still, There are some people who do pretty bad things. Copyright is **nothing** compared to what I've seen made of other IPs)
Ya copied some pixels? Die im hell 
Why do people attack the creator?
because the creator created this?
Welp, nice one.
Even more screenshots found from the dev's Discord server here: . . . . This isn't just some kid doing this for fun. I guess this game used to be based on his reverse engineered Crab Game source. The same guy was making hacks for Crab Game too, which is pretty weird that he wanted to make a game like it himself. As you can see from [this](), it used to be a 3D game before. That was probably changed for legal reasons.. . But yeah, this has been monetized, and has infringed multiple copyrighted games. u/1CrazyFoxx1 Thanks for contacting Omocat. This cannot continue like this.
And even more.. . . . I'm not going to dig any deeper now. Basically this guy reverse-engineered a copyrighted game and tried to sell it with a different name.
Alright, calm down. It's a free game clearly made for fun on the side by someone trying out game development. This isn't some kind of copyright infringement case where someone is flipping assets for a profit. This is someone who's clearly a fan of stuff Like OMORI and is trying out developing with assets that aren't 100% theirs because, even if it's just RPG maker MV, starting out with something simple just to show you can get something out there before moving on to bigger projects is good as a starting point. I doubt that even OMOCAT really wants to take the time out of her day to try and legally smack this kid who's just messing around and uploading something free and dumb to steam to show that they can.
I think the main problem with this though is they put it on Steam instead of just showing it off on their Twitter or even itch.io as a “fan/practice” game. They put stolen assets on the big for-profit marketplace, which generally means you’re looking to make some sort of money or publicity, which is perfectly fine with your own original work.
It might seem like that on the surface, but there's a lot more going on. Check [this comment.]()
wtf i can’t believe omocat stole these character desifns!
If the game isn't being sold for money than omocat can't do anything about it, they aren't profiting, but if they are she can. Not to say that this isn't wrong, but it's also not a big deal, omocat is chill with her IP and even let's their be fan merch
But fan merch is: "hey, this is Basil, from omori, the game we both love, I made this myself, wanna buy one?". . While this is: "THis is completely my own game, I did this myself, originally me, this is my game and this are my own character". . Even if the author isn't making profit, it still is inappropiate use of Omocat's IP
You can file a DMCA even if it isn't making a profit. Companies do that all the time.
*cough* Nintendo *cough*
Check [this comment]() for more information. It was monetized before.
Considering the Japanese stuff, probably
Isn’t the game named after the Japanese word hikikomori too?
Yes
The game is about a shut in. I think the game being named after a term for shut in is pretty reasonable.. . That is unless I'm getting r/woosh'd
In this case it's absolutely intentional, though. Look at this art from Omocat back in 2013: [. . It says "Hikkikomori" in Hiragana on the right.
Also, Im pretty sure in the original omoriboy comic theres a panel talking about the origin of his name, and its from hikikomori
Yeah I think so too. It would make the most sense. It would be far too big of a coincidence if Omocat knew the term hikikomori and then created a game that just happens to be part of that term while the game is about someone who is in fact a hikikomori. And the route where you stay inside and don't open the door for Kel is even called the hikikomori route.
it's hikikomori not hikkikomori
Ok
the first thing i thought reading this is that it was asking whether omocat invented the name mari
"Truth" will "follow you into your dreams"...............................................
The game has a lot of subtle details that can take multiple playthroughs to notice, I'm sure this is one of them
My favorite one is that everyone forgets about the snake who gives you clams. First time I saw him I thought something was strange with him. Wasn't until three months later that I understood why.
Literally just realized that Snaley's deaths are also foreshadowing
Okay what weird about the snake and what do snail's deaths foreshadow
That's some chad level detailing if that's the case.
Br\*ton 
mate it's from lower brittany in france not britain 😭😭
Even worse, Fr\*nch
(silent slow clap intensifys)
[Something like this?]()
maybe, omocat is like the bojack horseman of video game creators. anyways obligatory me liking how me and mari have the same name 
Do you like pizza?
yes 
I would say so
Undoubtedly. There are references made in other character's names (Like Omori coming from hikikomori), so, even if it was accidental, the production team would have been aware of the name's meaning and decided to integrate it.
Breton 🤢🤮 (worst elder scrolls species)
Yes 
probably.

You can check OMOCAT’s Twitter or Instagram page within the next two days, and she will probably post the release date at 5:00 PM Pacific Time! The plushies will probably release at 5:00 PM Pacific Time on the release date, too.
They haven’t released yet, but when they do, you can buy them at www.omocat-shop.com! The release date will probably be shown in a day or two on OMOCAT’s Twitter and Instagram, and the time of day they start selling will probably be 5:00 PM in Pacific Time!
omg thank you for telling me :D
No, but there should be a release date posted on one of OMOCAT’s socials within the next day or two at 5 PM Pacific Time!
Yippee!!
Omocat’s shop is gonna have it up for preorder soon
These are official plushies that will be sold on www.omocat-shop.com sometime in the future! The release date has not been revealed yet, but it probably will be revealed today or tomorrow on OMOCAT’s Twitter or Instagram.
But why not? He is a great Aquarius and his birthday is according to Omocat 18th February, which is also MY birthday.
I know for a fact both are lies because feb 18th is MY birthday and only one person can have that birthday at a time and I don’t remember letting anyone borrow feb 18th
There are going to be available on the omocat shop, but not available yet 
Omocat shop, but not available yet!
Okay Thank you!!!
Art by OMOCAT.
LOLLL
im pretty sure its an artstyle from omocat
I suppose it's a signature omocat thing; a quirk maybe? Either way, it's not all that bad! Makes the sillys look all the more wholesome 
>omocat is a fujoshi. . Source?
you do know omocat baits sunflower pretty periodically right like this isn't obscure or anything is just omocat baiting again lol
Idk if id use the word bait more like adds moments. I mean the whole calendar has moments
oh I mean in general saying omicat baits the ship a bunch is the most neutral way to describe it. just generally speaking they do it quite a bit, like, outside the calander, too.
Ah ok i get what youre saying but id still say bait gives off a more like negative connotation to it. I think they intend on it being a least a little canon. I certainly expect one of the ships to be a little more confirmed in the art book
they're like a perfect replica of my parents, when looking for a reference for a toxic couple omocat looked at my mom and dad and said "perfect"
oh shit your mom locks your dad in the basement and forces him to eat from a dog food bowl too?
wait what?
i need indonesia and suomi languange. . tell omocat
And i need an official italian translation...
gum rolls in his grave
Mau jadi translator bang?. . Too bad Indonesian language isn't pretty popular in the gaming industry (exception for mobile gaming)
I saw an Indonesian gaming news article once that said you can "choose your character based on their gender" in OMORI, so i guess localization into Indonesian is quite needed lmao. . ([link for anyone interested, second paragraph]())
That was actually supposed to be a feature in the game, but it was cut for time. Notice that the article was written in 2015, way before the final release
damn
Omocat should add traditional Chinese besides simplified
agreed
It's Omocat XD
Bruh 🗿 gg
XD
i'm talking about the real life body pillow that was, for a limited time, available to buy from omocat's website
oh
Yes. Omocat loves messing around and is basically a member of the community of the game she made instead of a community manager or something.
Goddamnit not you again
it's always me
She hardly interacts with the community. . . .  She just comes to us and milks us for money sometimes
I'm not gonna say yes, but...
She milks... the creature
creepcast fan spotted
My bank account, yes
Wow, that's super cynical. Who are you, me when it comes to the devs of CotL?
Dear OMOCAT bring it back plssss
It is!. . Omocat is just chill like that. Game devs who are like that are the best.
No lore, just a funny goof from omocat
Headcannon: they are both characters in a popular indie game called "Omori" developed by artist "Omocat"
Jock and pretty boy, they’re from a comic Omocat made.
Pretty boy is in the game??
In the park.
Because Omocat is an artist
I believe a reference to OMORI's GF, from the original comics omocat made. . She was created of le horny in le head
I mean OMOCAT did tell you to not pull the lever but the curious people we are, we pulled it. 
oh... i thought the post was asking how omocat came up with the name and was about to make a comment on everyone else's assumptions, but uh... huh.
I think that’s the shading, omocat likes shading things with a purplish color
You can see that they're all wearing t-shirts from official omocat shop. So it probably isn't story scene.
dam
depress
deshpresho
yeah, im starting to form several headcanons in my mind, and Omocat doing potential shipping material, i feel is not going to be good
maybe maybe, my friend. i suppose only Omocat knows
omocat, the creator of the game, made it to promote the merch :3
dam  . Omocat you are sending some mixed signals here!
yeah, but it might not be that at all. this was actually made by Omocat lol
dam
dam
dam
dam
dam
dam
zam
yh it's from Omocat actually
wait, they're all (or most of them) are wearing shirts from omocats merch shop.
yh lol it was promotional for the omori fans
It’s the advertisement art for OMOCAT’s shirts that released a while back. Every character in the art is wearing a shirt themed around themselves
Goddamn that t shirt is so cute but idk if that'd look right with me lol
I'm straight but omocat got me simping more for. Hero and Basil that Aubrey and Mari.. omocat makes me question my sexuality.... (Kel is just there for the borgers)
WAIT PRETTY BOY???? omori side character had a whole story what!??
It's short but yeah. . Lemme see if I have the link. . Here. . 
oh my god that was so cute!!! im putting this as canon in omori fr
It is!! THEY ARE SO CUTE

Anyone who read this comic should watch RainingKetchup’s dub of it. It’s pretty funny
Link please?

Tnxx 
FOOTBALL
oh no it's paqoe's pfp
If OMOCAT ever does do another game (I believe she has showed interest in possibly doing another game), it would cool to see it based off of these characters! Their designs are very interesting 
The omo team barely survived going through Omori’s production. I’ll actually be surprised if they did
For sure, but it was a learning experience where they got to learn from their mistakes. If they ever decided to make another game, I'm sure it would be a lot more organized (with what we've seen, I still do not have high hopes for good communication tho lmao)
this is all theoretical though, omocat can just chose to not make a new game. and if she wanted to it would take a couple years anyway. still cool to think about!
Yeah, of course. . It's just- That artstyle is just too good-
As far as I know, most of the pages for these comics were on some defunct website linked on her Tumblr but I don't feel like giving up just yet because of how interesting it'd be to see these guys.. . There are barely enough people talking about this, let alone Omoriboy and Pretty Boy. So it'd be cool if more people in the fandom would see this and maybe find it somewhere.
Those guys look very interesting wtf
Guess she stopped making them after Omori. . Idk where you can find the old ones though
I remember finding out the other say omocat is responsible for pretty boy. The artstyle felt so similar i just needed the conformation.
I actually read Pretty Boy before even playing Omori lol, even as tiny as it is it's so depressing to me, I should read the others
no idea but the girl to the left of pretty boy looks a LOT like artist (angel's sister) . . ok just checked [the wiki]() and apparently her design is actually based off of her! 
Wait is that angel's sister?
I’m pretty sure she finished pretty boy and made a pamphlet with the comic, but that was taken off the store. You can still read it online, idk abt the others I just love Pretty Boy. . Edit: Could I get a link to the other ones? They seem interesting!
I think I found Amber!  . 
Love, I think?  . 
Either she completed or she abandoned.

 This video is as close as you’ll get
I like amber
Mono? Is that you
Omocat is a talented woman. If only she would be more open with us more kind and reduce the prices on merchandizing because Toby fox could never. ConcernedApe could never. I swear 🥲
huh
They're characters from omocat's other comics, totally different characters. They share some design pieces as a self-reference.
They look friend shaped.
Does Love have a comic?
IS THAT PRETTY BOY, MONO LITTLE NIGHTMARES?
They went to black space
Lovely this is still seen
IIRC guitar guy (Micheal from faraway town) actually came from an old omocat comic, but I can’t find it anywhere anymore and the wiki doesn’t even mention it on his trivia section… :( but I know it exists because I vividly remember reading it
Wait! I found it! . 
I only knew about pretty boy where did the others come from?
WEG. VERSCHWUNDEN . Nicht mehr da
I noticed that most of them are similar to todays designs.
HoLY shit i love love
I miss OMORIBOY 
I think Omocat did not really bother that much.The phone is still working (could be powered by battery tho) and the friggin microwave that consumes hundreds of WATTS! She just wanted lights out for the athmosphere.
I always thought the omocat tweet was just her being funny lmao.. why would she be named Aubergine
Yes it would. I have a couple of ideas on why his hair isn’t messy: . . 1: Omocat didn’t think about that. . 2: Omocat is bad at (in her opinion) or doesn’t like drawing messy hair. . 3: art style. . I have no in universe explanation. Maybe Sunny hated having messy hair because he hated how it looked or because it would get in his eyes?
i mean sonny is always dressed nice and looks groomed so maybe he took care of himself in that aspect
4: still felt like he had to be ready for the recital. Would also explain why he still wore nicer clothes and things
Makes sense
Nah can't be 2, I looked at the other art omocat did and she can pretty much draw any type of hair she wants.. . She probably deliberately chose this hair design for them,why? I don't know, it's probably easier to animate by yourself or something...
Because Omocat Kinda has a certain style when it comes to designing the face of characters to be different…
Omocat isn't a barber she can only do so many bang styles obviously 🙄 /j
Just OMOCAT's style, or to hide awkward forehead space, I imagine.
omocat has a same-face syndrome thing going on but with hairstyles
this bothers me so much please omocat why
i know it could be interpreted as art style or artistic choice but i've gotten so used to it that it gives me sense of familiarity and comfort. seeing that style of basic simple hair reminds me of omori all the time because omocat has practically adopted the style
Because omocat is right handed.
Its omocat’s art style
Omocat staple!!
omocat forlogoret to fix their hair
Where's goku?. . I think omocat just doesn't know a lot of different hairstyles, drawing is hard
Omocat got creative
idk, I mean its not like omocat can't/doesn't draw other bang styles because there are characters in the game who have other bang styles
But that's how OMOCAT pronounced his name in her twitch streams
Boom it's Bay-sil case solved we can go home fellas
Omocat also calls him bay sil
Omocat pronounces it Bay-Sil. He was right, you and his Dad are wrong. GGs
That may be so but Omocat specifically used bay-sil for him so it's Bay-sil officially
Omocat says Bay but in my heart it’s Bah
Your heart is wrong❤️
That why my taste is so bad?
Yes, she has said it like that. It's pretty clear the game is set somewhere in the US. Also I think with names it wouldn't be proper to pronounce someone's name how you think it should sound, it should be done how the person said it. So the closest thing we have to that is Omocat herself, I'd think
The name is supposed to be pronounced Bah-zul (not said by Omocat, but like in general the name is pronounced that way), plus I’m British so the herb is also pronounced that way. So.. he’s Bah-zul lol
If Omocat says “Bay sil” then that’s the correct way
Omocat pronounced his name “Bay-sul” on a stream
I've heard omocat herself say bay-sil so that. But I'm European so I say bah-sil since to me it just rolls off the tongue more
I’m bri’ish and pronounce the herb bah-sul but given that it’s his name and he’s American I pronounce it the American way that omocat pronounces it (with a bay)
I pronounce it as Bay-sil and so does [Omocat]() but Bo En pronounces it as Bah-Sil and he's cooler than Omocat so I don't know who to believe anymore.
It's Bay-sul, OMOCAT said his name out loud multiple times in this video \^\^  . . .  [
I pronounce it Bay-sil, which is also the way Omocat herself pronounces it. I don't really think it matters what pronounciation is right, though
Bay-sed
Bae-sil
When I started playing the game I called him Baz-il and when i realized that was the wrong pronunciation (omocat herself called him Bay-sil) it was too late. I can't get Baz-il out of my head
You forgot the r
Omocat pronounces it as baysil so that’s how I pronounce it
Omocat did a stream and pronounced it Bay-sil, so that's the cannon one. . Edit: the vod can be found here 
The most common way is bay-sil so.... Omocat also pronouce like that so why not just follow her
Omocat pronounced it Bay-sill in her stream on his birthday, so yes there is a correct way to say it and it’s bay-sil since the creator of the game said so B)
I know omocat pronounces it as bay-sil on her stream, so I believe that’s the proper way.
Omocat pronounces it as Bay-sil.
That doesn't mean it's "objectively correct." Unless the game gets voice acting, I wouldn't consider any single pronunciation canon, regardless of the source.
omocat literally made the game, though. i personally don't really care about how people pronounce it, but that's as close as canon as a pronunciation can get in a game like this
Omocat also said Orange Joe is supposedly coffee and orange juice mixed together, but the in-game version seems more likely to be a brand of orange soda from what details we can garner from the game (bright orange coloration not possible with coffee mixed in, plus it comes in plastic bottles and, if memory serves correctly, cans from a vending machine - containers common for soda, but not really for coffee). Needless to say, I don't think everything Omocat tweets is canon.
just because some things the creator says don't make sense doesn't mean it's not canon to the story they made. it's possible to ignore things and believe something you like better, though, especially if it's something unimportant like the recipe of a drink or the pronunciation of a name. . . plus, omori is still fictional and the subject of orange joe isn't really something to be taken seriously, so in this case a made up explanation could easily be given, like "it's bright orange because the fictional brand of coffee has a different colour than real coffee" or "there's another product added in that changes the colouring without changing the flavour", or just "it's not actually made with coffee and orange juice, the company that sells it is shady and gives out fake information about its contents"
It might just be the artstyle Omocat was going for, like how the portraits (besides Omori) are only light/dark purple
it may be because a lot of the designs changed during development and omocat didnt bother changing old art
I know why omocat did it, but I’m a little disappointed the reason the tissue box was there was retconned
I don't think so, but all the items originate from the Omoriboy comics OMOCAT made before developing OMORI. I suppose they're just things that they find comforting or to take their mind off of certain things...
Omocats
Omocat writing the most messed up things imaginable and putting them in her game.
I Actually think omocat slipped that name out during one of her streams
Do you have a source or a clip of this or anything? I have not heard of this before, and I’m 90% sure it isn’t true since suzuki has been a common headcanon name since before omocat would talk on stream. Unless she talked in some old stream I’m not aware of
I mean, it could be that she liked the headcanon name and adopted it...
same. been a fan of omocat for forever
i found omocats legend of zelda comics when i was younger and into legend of zelda, so i went to her youtube and watched the first two trailers.
Back in 2017 my friend were going to a con, saw Omocat’s booth and they advertised Omori. Hooked ever since.
My girlfriend is an artist and a she follows OMOCAT, she told me she wanted to play it because she heard amazing things about it, we play the heck of it.
I’ve been a fan of Omocat since her early Tumblr fame and loved her Omoriboy comics. I was there the day the kickstarter was announced (yes, I’m old af).
I’ve been a fan of omocat for a while so that’s how I found out when it was first announced . . but didn’t actually play it till this year!
I had been following omocat for years after first reading Pretty Boy, then when looking for new games on the switch it popped up
Omocat did that Hololive tie-in a while back
I had been following OMOCATs omoriboy tumblr since the beginning baby!! 
I’ve been a fan of omocat’s art for a long time and i heard abt the game when I was  in like grade 8 I think lol, had no money so I couldn’t support it at the time but I was very excited when I heard it had come out (& I’m an adult now with a job so I can buy it)
Least insane Twitter Omocat moment:
Save it for the group chat, Omo.
i mean,its omocat,we know how omocat treats omori
Damn Omocat! Why?
Pretty sure it wasn’t scrapped just a fun drawing Omocat posted.
On one hand that would mean omocat having to redraw every single cutscene with Sunny's opposite gender.. . On the other hand, Hikikomori girl.. . I'm sorry omocat.
Yeah be nice and possible other genderbends for another characters, I think would be cool, but it’s to much work honestly for Omocat in the past. If she did that we could’ve got omori in 2020.
Fantasizing in the context of this situation has a sexual context you're heavily implying which does not reflect the reality of the ships most fans make, . . You're acting as if we have no idea who these characters are but we do, we all experienced the game and it portrayed the characters dealing with heavy issues and we experienced their growth throughout the story, it's only natural that people would want to imagine a peaceful life where they settle down after those events where they can be happy, that's what most people are doing that you seem so disgusted by.. . You believe you have some sort of moral high ground here but the issue you seem to have is not about morality, it's about your own perception of what ships inherently imply.. . As I alluded to before by your logic every writer who has ever written a story with a minor in a relationship is therefor creepy and morally wrong for doing so or do you have some justification why it's okay for Omocat or J.K Rowling or The Duffer Brothers or anyone else writing about youth in relationships to get a pass but when fans do it it's creepy or are they creeps too?
The definition of "fantasizing" is just a Google search away dude. . . You have no relation to these characters. You do not know them, and they are not your friends, fantasizing about them is weird ah 💀 I've said this already in another comment, but unless you yourself are around their age range, don't fantasize about them. This includes the headspace characters, because the shipping art of 12 year olds is especially creepy.. . . There's a big difference between creating a story yourself, and fantasizing about preexisting characters where the relationships have already been established. People who create stories make characters, and have to establish relationships, and how they act around other characters they create. Romantic relationships may be established to further move along the plot, to create attachments towards the characters, or to appeal to a certain audience.
Again my issue with You specifically using fantasize is that You are using it to imply something more than people typically imagine for these characters by using the word.. . Once a character and a story is out in the world it's fans have the freedom to continue that story in any way they choose this is their head cannon, the fans choosing to take established characters and stories and continue it in the way they would want it to go. . . It's been something people have done all throughout history again regardless if age therefore they themselves become the creators of their own branched narrative based on existing works which in essence is no different than an author writing a sequel to a story with established characters. . . I used the example of a parent or a brother to try and convey a point that you clearly missed because relation to the character has nothing to do with this it's about wanting whoever is being shipped to to be happy in your own head cannon be it a real person or a fictitious one, you implying it goes further than that into a more sexual territory is based on your own preconcieved notions not anyone else's as the vast majority of those who ship characters do not take it there, because That would be creepy.
I'm really not tho? Seriously, Google what it means because this is just getting sad 💀. . . Of course the fans have the creative freedom to expand upon these stories, but that doesn't mean what they do is always morally okay.. . . So seeing some random kids in a park and fantasizing about them being together is okay, because you just want to see them be happy? Weird thing to double down on ngl
Some of these are genuine criticisms ie long segments that haven’t got anything to do with the story, everything else is just bashing the game to make something else seem better. I heard OMOCAT cleared the “sh0ta” controversy up already.
The WHAT. Also can you please send me whatever the fuck their apologies were or whatever they said in response?
Someone decided to bring up old posts from when OMOCAT was younger, some of them contained the word “sh0ta” or depictions of young men (not sure of the nature of these pictures, wasn’t stated in what I read. I would guess they were innocent or OMOCAT would’ve been crucified). OMOCAT apologised for use of the term, as they didn’t know of the actual meaning. A while ago terms like this were used interchangeably for “anime boy” or “anime girl” before the p€d0s hijacked the whole thing.
i’ve seen the pics of the shirt and it’s literally just a kid. nothing remotely sexual abt it. i think another controversy was they made a fujoshi shirt but again it was so tame and made in like 2012 like,, who cares lol we all did stupid vaguely problematic shit back then. i think it was more a comment on internet culture than anything supportive too. . and yet i still see so many people on twitter calling omocat a freak bc of two t shirts they made
I saw the shirt, had a picture of a young boy who kind of looked similar to OMORI. Apparently they were partially supposed to be a parody of a similar shirts in Japan at the time which just said ‘boy’ in English. Shota I believe just means boy in Japanese.
thank you so much for the context, seriously was abouta be furious until you cleared this up. Thank you so damn much!!
Np!
Sounds like a similar situation to "Rebbeca Sugar sexualised Ed Edd and Eddy characters" but it turned out she was, like, 14 at the time...
LMAO
do you have a source? /pos
I think if you Google something like “OMOCAT” shota parody shirts you’ll find some sort of internet drama. It’s a shirt with a boy on it with the word “shota” which means boy. People got it mixed with the…other meaning
i was more talking about the post where OMOCAT apologizes but after searching for a bit i found it. i’m a bit complexed on it because i have seen posts where people say “how could OMOCAT misunderstand the meaning of shota in these old posts”. OMOCAT has said before that when the company was start, OMOCAT was a teenager. So these posts (and I believe the early comics of OMORI too) were made when they were younger. In regards to some of the posts I actually can see where a misunderstanding could be and where it could be understood as them understanding the bad meaning. I see a story could be made for both sides of the coin. I do believe that since that was nearly 10 years ago and OMOCAT was most likely a teen for those posts that they have changed or been able to better themself. i love OMORI and the message of forgiveness and overcoming trauma that it has. maybe it’s possible that OMOCAT put out those posts because of their own trauma or something. i don’t know but i would really love to believe that someone who can make such an amazing thing bringing to light mental illness is at least somewhat a good person.
yea its the "shota" vs "shotacon" thing.  . some people say shota is a shortened version of shotacon, but shotacon is already a shortened version of Shōtarō complex. you dont shorten a shortened version. also shota is basically the male equivalent of loli/lolli
butthurtness
I do recognise that Omori it self has some issues, but they did not hamper my experience at all. Honestly all the somewhat major problems are external to the game, certain things in the community and omocat herself.
I think I'm a bit out of the loop here, what are the major problems that you mentioned?
I honestly wouldn’t call them big problems (well besides one but I’m not sure it’s allowed to talked about it here) I was just being hyperbolic, but if you had to know it just some personal gripes, I wish the community could make up new jokes rather then constantly over use Kel and Stairs over and over. As for omocat besides the other thing I don’t like her rules she enforces on people making fan made Omori stuff, even if this is something that’s completely reasonable I find it a bit too restrictive.
Can you give an example of what she doesn't allow?
. You can see them all here, very first post
I don’t see anything wrong with that, she’s just protecting he intellectual property. She’s only talking about SELLING omori fanwork. It’s actually pretty nice of her to let any omori fanwork get sold considering it’s her intellectual property, she could’ve outright banned any Omori fanwork being sold and could be straight suing people for it. So if anything she is actually being pretty nice
Thats how I feel about games tbh. . You can be critical and stuff, in fact I think thats important so you can gain the perspective of why people may dislike the game, . but overall if you enjoyed the experience as a whole, are the criticisms really a massive deal?
what’s wrong with rpg maker games? it’s just a platform to make games, nothing wrong with it
idk it’s just kinda weird and u didn’t rly elaborate. . rpg maker is just a platform for making stuff. it’s like going “i hate games made with unity”. it’s just kind of a weird thing to care abt when i don’t see any kind of issue with rpg maker when used well
That's weird... I really don't see what's wrong with RPG maker
Personal preferences are there for a reason, is it just unreasonable bias towards RPG maker games or something else? please explain
But if you make a good game with it despite all the limitations it shouldn't be a problem right?
Uhh.. okay...
I don't know the full details but apparently OMOCAT said she liked shotas or something 7 years ago and twitter decided to cancel her for that. . Edit:don't have any confirmation on this one but she also made a picture shipping 2 male characters which I don't know why is apparently wrong
I read from another comment that Omocat just used the term without knowing what it meant, she apologised already ?
Yea but for some reason no one listens to a apology
(Necropost, but I just came across this) There's a super old apology post in her blog, yes.. . I honestly think it's kinda weird to think she didn't know that, especially considering [these tweets]().. . Do keep in mind, however, those are a screenshot so it's entirely possible it's fake I guess. Even if they weren't, I really don't think this is a big deal. Not only was this 7 years ago but it ain't even that bad.
The omocat controversy?
I find it funny how this person tries to call out OMOcat for shit she did but ignores the fact that Scott literally donated to the Trump campaign.
Yeah what scott did was really fucking scummy. I have no respect for him anymore. I dont want my lgbtq+ friends being hurt because scott donated to transphobic and homophobic organizations.
That doesn’t judge an entire person’s character.
I know. And I don’t judge his entire character on it. I was just raising the point that trying to call OMOCat problematic as a reason to hate Omori is flawed if the creator of the game your comparing to has has also done stuff.
Ah your one of those people listen I’m not sure if you heard about this but it’s called having a different political opinion I know very shocking
What? You mean about Scott’s donation or OMOcat?. . Cuz look, my knowledge in what OMOcat “did” is limited. So maybe I’m wrong.
Scott donation
Oh, that. . . Well I should probably clarify that no, I don’t dispose Scott over just that. I actually respect him quite a bit. But his donation was made to a campaign that clearly wants to hurt people like me and my friends and family. So I’m very bitter about that. I still respect what Scott did and respect his game. But I just do not respect his choices. And i don’t have to.
Well thank you for the mature response but I’m sure scott only donated because he thought trump would be a good president to fuel the economy and probably didn’t agree with views on immigration
Whatever his motives were, whats done is done. I do still respect him as a game designer and respect his games. He’s clearly not a hateful person because he treats his fandom so nicely. It’s sad, but I just can’t bring myself to stand by his support of trump. I won’t force anyone to agree with me though.
Alright nice chat
the person ur arguing with is being too nice. . scott is a shitty person for donating to the trump campaign. there’s literally no benefits to trump in any way and if it wasn’t done out of malice then it was ignorance/stupidity and is *still shitty regardless*
First time? You've never seen her 7yrs long hate thread on lolcow (wanted to see what all the controversy was all abt, worst mistake of my life).. . From what I've seen, people hating on Omori that care enough to make these are really biased.. . They just hopped on the Omocat hate bandwagon that started when the game began to be delayed without frequent or detailed updates, leading to believe that the whole thing was a scam of some sort (the game even got on r/shittykickstarters), and you can see this even on some comments under the 2017 trailer on yt. And obviously, some of the real life accomplishments of Omocat (like her graduation) didn't help, and people started accusing her of horrible things (like using the money for her private life instead of making the game). The only thing on which I still didn't do my research about is the whole shotacon controversy, so I don't have an opinion on that.. . Of course there are a *lot* of other things to say, but for the sake of my comment's length I won't write them here. . . If you notice these posts usually revolve around hating on the creator instead of criticizing the game, and even when they do, it's just some brainrot take like "the game is boring", "it's an rpg maker game" or "it's Earthbound inspired". They either just never really played the game and want to be a part of the contrarian gaming community, or they hate Omocat so much that it prevents them from enjoying the game (really sad imo).. . She did wrong things, for sure, but that was due to a lack of experience, that caused her to underestimate several things, and you can clearly see this if you've been on forums and twitter about the game during development. . . I personally think Omocat doesn't deserve all the hate she got/gets.. The game wasn't a scam, and it turned out to be one of the best rpgs out there, if not the very best.
Preeety sure that none of omocat’s comics sexualised young boys. They’re all just wholesome love comics.
Well, when he has a point, is a lie, sometimes it's actually a good thing, and some things really don't matter, like, who the fuck cares if omocat is a shotacon, i know omori doesn't have shotacon content so who the fuck cares about omocat or development time, i care about the taste of sausage not the way its made. . (And also, fnaf is bad lol)
Fnaf is bad?. . Hmmm..... . Fnaf 1, 2 and 3 are pretty neat, same goes for 4 and SL. . but the rest are jokes. . You're right, but at the same time not
the games aren’t even comparable. . being violent or scary doesn’t dictate how good the game is. . I’d argue the game probably wasn’t even meant to scare anyone, at least not nearly to the extent FNAF is. . the only valid point in my opinion is the thing about Omocat sexualizing young boys
Unbased meme ,didn't even mention fnaf creator donated to big gov that was against peoples rights and didn't apologize for it cuz he believed it was the best decision.. . If there gonna mention omocat (who was very much apologizing for what happened and won't mention it or do any of that ever again as she heard it was very bad.) They should point that put.
According to Omocat in [this video]() at 6:15 the figures are individually going to be $28 USD and the 6 can be sold together for a cheaper price that buying them separately.
So, it stings.
I think Omocat said they would be $28 on stream
That’s a really good price!
I think it's a bit much speaking the size comparisons makes me think they're half the size of a funko pop
Might be smaller but definitely higher quality than a funko
Oh absolutely, Funko has 0 quality control, it's just a shame they're probably gonna sell out in the first day and only restock once in a blue moon like the plushes.
Like the Neighbor's Room T-Shirt.  Been waiting for that to restock since forever.
Its my only issue with the shop at this point. The best selling merch is almost never available to buy. I was looking through the OMORI section and I was so relieved that they at least had shirts and hoodies because it was refreshing to see something really nice like the plushes or pins per say is actually within reach.
Omocat said they would be on the price range of $30
Omocat said on one of her livestreams on Steam that they would be the same price as the plushies; So $28 
I believe Omocat said on her debut stream that they're gonna be under 30 each?
probably way more than they’re worth, Omocat overcharges like crazy 😐
As someone who's managed to get the plushies the first time around, here's some words of advice: Omocat usually gives a time when stuff like this is going to be up for purchase. If you're planning on buying these, you need to be there right before or exactly at that time. Have your account logged in and payment details and addresses in beforehand so you can be ready for the launch. (The website goes down sometime before the launch) Don't take the time to look around. Know what you plan on getting and immediately check out.
$28, Omocat said so in a stream, dunno what a full set will cost
IIRC correctly last OmoCat stream she said something like $28 USD each.
15$ a pop, if Omocat is nice they might do something like 60$ for ALL of them
I wish omocat came out with these in March because I had $134 I didn’t even end up using, and now I only have $50 😭
Classic omocat
There are literally posable figures out there from much bigger brand names and manifacturers that charge 10-15$ for the same height figure. Open any site like rarewaves, amazon, ebay etc... Figures like these that Omocat sells go on the market for less than 8$ and people are just paying for the brand name "Omori" and nothing else. People are just gonna go to sites like Aliecpress or Etsy to buy off brand or hand made merch of Omori since its way more affordable.
Sketch like omocat does in the official omori website with the Sketchbook if you click it.
Knowing OMOCAT probably 50$ minimum
Probably around £40-£60. Most Omocat merch costs a pretty penny. Don't really know about dollar value though.
A lot. Omocat is so cool and a major idol of mine but holy shit she likes her prices. I've bought omori merch myself but it's not cheap. Worth but could definetly be cheeper. Calendar event was expensive as hell
In normal stores they would cost 30$, but this is omocat, the one who uses our feelings for benefit, so maybe 60$ each
You say that as if it will make it go faster if it’s one single artist. Also do you even know anything about production or omocat?
if OmoCat is releasing this all at once then ?? its gonna take a long time??? come on, patience
yea for sure i agree, though omocat seems to really like leaving things up in the air and hinting but not explicitly confirming a lot of stuff in game
I think OMOCAT once said that Omori's story could only be told properly in game format, or something along those lines. While I'd love more OMORI content and a way to spread awareness of the game to more people, I feel like a tv series wouldn't do it justice, especially if it's made by Netflix 💀
Yeah, that's why they ditched the webcomic early on.
I mean, to be fair, they could do something like Bandersnatch and implement choices into the series.
An interactive series would be even worse 
NOT NETFLIX. IF OMOCAT GIVES IT TO NETFLIX I'M GOING INTO MURDER MODE. 
I'd be pretty excited for it if it were animated. It has to be animated I'm not watching a live action series. Also I'd like for Omocat to still be somewhat running things in a way. Also they need to add at least something new to the show that wasn't in the game to be somewhat interesting.
And that is exactly why the text was cut. For starters, it ruins much of the twist. Secondly, it's just not necessary. Finally, it doesn't really fit the scenario properly. . . If you're going to use content that OMOCAT had deemed unfit for her final version to argue with me about very important aspects of a character, then you'll just be wasting both of our time.
it went on to delvelope a game called omori under the name: omocat
Very clever…
The true ending
check omocats youtube channel please 
Yes it's confirmed by OMOCAT that this is coming out
Omocat posted it so im guessing it is
You're not subed to Omocat on YT, do you?. Yes, this is real
(>!are those cards in image 2 still in the Omocat shop? They're so cute!!!!<)
They were for the cafe I think? They might be available still but they weren’t on the omocat website!
Aw damn :( thanks anyway
OMOCAT merch shop
I started the collection 3 years ago so its taken a long time to get so much, but i have my own job and im only a teenager so i have absolutely nothing else to spend my money on and its Very uncostly when youre in that situation, a lot of it is also bootleg plushies that are like $3 and cheaper little decorations, i believe the most expensive thing in the collection by far is the giclee print which was $40 on omocat shop
I thought Omocat was a woman lol
I'm talking about omori >! creating new friends in his dreams!<, not omocat
I just realised I misread that , I'm sorry. . Anyway, thanks for clearing it up
OMOCAT uses they/them I think 
I got mines off Walmart. Im pretty sure you can buy them on Omocat’s website tho
It’s actually crazy that people are still buying even with the terrible quality drop. People need to stop funding these terrible plushes, omocat is just cutting corners to squeeze more money out of her community. No more love
i mean most people would have gotten the first drop if they could but they sold out after a DAY and most ppl weren't ready
The Omocat one looks stoned out of her goddamned mind.
Stonocat
YOOOO OMOCAT PLUSH???
Why does to omocat one look drunk 💀
I heard that some people contacted customer support and they were able to get a refund, however, I don’t know if they do replacements. Honestly, for a $28 dollar plush I expected better. The quality of the new plushies are so bad that I’m considering no longer purchasing Omocat products until the problem has been acknowledged and fixed.
This is actually very interesting :o. The bootleg is toootally visibly the best out of all of them by a landslide! Suuuuch good quality…Omocat could never!!
Seems like Omocat was playing with the forehead slider
It's from Omocats official website! It's sold out now :( if you want to find one, I'd recommend eBay or Mercari, but they might raise the price a lot
thank u!
Omocat's website! Which is where they also sell the plushes, figures, etc. It's currently sold out, but people might resell them, sadly at a way higher price tho
Mostly from Etsy, and the Omocat shop
I got the news via mail.. . At the bottom of the Omocat Shop site, there's an option to subscribe to their newsletter.
Whatever remains of Twitter, the OMOCAT accounts are there.
And also Instagram
Yeah , like when is omocat restocning the CDs ?????
the omocat store!
omocat llc
That's just part of the stand
it still goes around her neck lol
Ugh... Again? :(
I thought that was her hair.
I dont get the joke
Did you finish the game?
Yes
Okie yay congrats!
OH FUCK I JUST GOT WHAT THE JOKE IS. . 
How do you feel after realizing the joke behind this meme?
Amused. Its funny and some sort of good detail from Omocat
That's nice, there is plenty of room for the rope
The hangwoman
damn is that-
I see red circles, where Goku (downvote me)
the red circles actually make it harder to see what ur talking about
omocat knew what she was doing
Pros:. . \+ Bigger Flowers on crown. . \+ Brighter Color. . \+ Bigger Head. . Cons:. . \- Tighter Clothes. . \- Hair doesn't stick out as much. . \- Smaller limbs. . \- Limbs are significantly harder than old ones (hard to take off the already tight clothes and decorate). . \- Worse shirt design. . \- Tiny robes on the overall. . \- Flowres are hot glued to the crown. . \- The back of his hair are unreasonably long and wide. . \- Bad back posture. . \- No neck. . OMOCAT are cutting cost way too much, suffocating the poor plushies and the small limbs are signs of poor blood circulation,
Agreed. Quality control and customer service in general has been pretty bad with the Omocat shop.
this is official merch omocat makes
Thanks
From the official Omocat site.
Ok, thanks!
It's like a little museum of OmoCat & Omori stuff with a little shop in the front
aw man 😭 i made an omori shaker keychain to sell at my booth and i didn’t realize omocat already made something similar. . considering its rare im sure theres lots of other fan-made shaker keychains out there!!. . 
Yeah Ive seen a lot of these shop posts lately. . Whoever is in charge of the shop should not be in that position (I think Omocat is in charge? But especially for an entire community like Omori I feel like there should be people specifically for this)
I like pre orders, i always forget that i ordered something and its a suprise everytime, fuck omocat tho
That'd be why, omocat likes to cheap out on the restocks for whatever reason
I’ve seen other plushies come without noses and if you care enough you can 100% e-mail omocat support about it and they’ll send you a new one… this is really funny though
this was my guess as well, judging by the trend of omocats prices $80 sounds about right
Omg where is this being sold? On the OMOCAT website?
Yess and it comes out on the 21st!!
Fuck nearly £60 I was already robbed by the GSC preorders now omocat is robbing my broke ass
omocat’s shipping prices make me not wanting to buy anything anymore
It’s the official omocat store! You can buy them   here!
jesus christ omocat needs to find a new manufacturer
They should’ve stuck with the old one
does anyone know why they switched im not very caught up on the plushie manufacturer lore all i know is the new batches are horrendous in QC and the OG were ditched like immediately (?)
I have a speculation she’s trying to cut costs but who knows 🤷‍♀️
id fully believe it honestly, usually a seemingly random change such as this is because money
“HOW DO YA LIKE THAT, OMOCAT? I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT! You have 23 hours before the piss drrrrroppllllets hit Faraway Town, now get out of my fucking sight before I piss on you too.”. - Omori, 2025
the omocat legs curse has been mutated by nui
I always thought these were just tall socks, but since OMORI has a bra in his bathroom drawing in the sketchbook, the crossdressing theories begin to make more and more sense. Let OMOCAT cook.
that was made from the omoriboy days so i doubt it
dude he's a CHILD
?? teenagers and children aren't the same tf
After all the fanbase discourse over the years Omocat wouldn’t dare. These people would skin her alive if she made ANY of these characters canonically straight lol.
Omocat >
Yeah i completely agree, bit disappointed but I'm sure omocat is excited and i appreciate the content
Yeah, it seems good so far. It’s interesting that Omocat’s telling parts of it out of order from how it played out in the game. I’ll follow along, but I don’t expect it to even come close to how great the game was.
grrr greedy omocat!! /j. . 
I don't really care I didn't make the comment to sound reasonable. I simply do not like giving omocat my money
OMOCAT APPROVED THIS SO IT’S CANON
No OMOCAT made it
level 100 big brain characterization.. . Bravo OMOCAT and Nui I-forgot-your-surname.
Dude the whole thing is like 6 pannels and it's only the first chapter, give it some time, Omocat made this, not some fan, she wouldn't just destroy a character like that, she literally made it.
>Omocat made this, not some fan, she wouldn't just destroy a character like that, she literally made it.. . No, Omocat is not the one writing the manga. Even if that was, that doesn't necessarily stop someone from destroying a character.. . Aubrey never swings that bat in game, not once. Trying to basically bash Kel's head in is fairly ooc.
Sure, but Omocat looked at it before it got published of course, it's not like she doesn't know how the manga looks like, so she saw the scene and was like "yeah, that's Aubrey".. I'm not trying to prove some headcanon view I have or trying to sound annoying, I'm just saying that if it were *that* bad, Omocat wouldn't let it through. Again, I'm sure this is just because it's the first chapter, there's some flaws I've heard people complain about: pacing, ooc interactions and the story being in wrong order, but to all of this I say, just wait a bit, let's let out a few more chapters before calling it bad, let's trust the it for now.. . PS- this is totally valid critisism, I'm just saying that those relatively small things shouldn't ruin the entire manga imo.
>Sure, but Omocat looked at it before it got published of course, it's not like she doesn't know how the manga looks like, so she saw the scene and was like "yeah, that's Aubrey".. . Just because Omocat wrote the character, does not mean they're right about her 100% of the time.. . >I'm just saying that if it were *that* bad, Omocat wouldn't let it through.. . I disagree, I think it is just that bad.. . >let's let out a few more chapters before calling it bad, let's trust the it for now.. . I agree, don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna wait and see more chapters, but the way Aubrey was done in the first chapter does not give a good first impression.. . I'm still interested in the manga, I don't think it's completely ruined, but again, not a good first impression.
Certainly not a good first impression, I agree with that, not for the same reason but that's further proof they messed some shit up
Fun fact, the two fonts we see in the game are OMOCAT's handwriting, the normal one being on her right hand and the scary one being on her left.
That's actually sick as hell. Love that.
To be fair, wasn't OMOCAT herself outed in a similar fashion recently? Everyone just kinda forgot about that, because, I mean, nobody likes it when the person behind a good story turns out to be yucky.
i think theres a significant difference between edgy tweets from a decade ago and actually putting time and effort into drawing those things. that's not to defend what omocat did all those years ago it's just that theres a lot more plausible deniability that they were genuine expressions of inappropriate attractions and not just extremely insensitive jokes.
hating on it for so many (valid) reasons im bout to leave this subreddit just for this release but also because of omocat's actions
Dear Omocat. . FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP BURNING THE SUN YOU GONNA KILL ALL LIFE ON EARTH YOU KNOW WHAT. . FINAL KAMEHAMEHAAAAA. *blows up Sun*. YOU AINT BURNING NO SUNS NOW!!!. . YOSHAAAA. . -sincerely . VEGITO YOSHAAAAA. . . Wait ..
bro are you good
No
Does it have anything to do with omocat tho? Or just a fanfic?
It’s official, OMOCAT didn’t make it herself but she approved it and it’s been announced on the official social media accounts.
Well he's a human after all and losing control can make you violent so this can happen to anybody. Plus the manga is under the supervision of Omocat so this is how Omocat wanted to Hero to react. Also I'm so tired of seeing people saying that the manga didin't respect the characters, cuz it's literally under Omocat's supervision, so no matter what, the charcters in the manga are how they wanted to be by Omocat. They're not your characters, so stop denying them for your headcanon and see them as the creator want to portray them.
Maybe Omocat's bangs looked like that and they decided to put the same bangs for all the characters.
 I mean sure the One we got Is Just chapter One of omori, but Is still cool to see and know Is real, i Hope that omocat changed a bit
Omocat's teaser for it on her channel is in English, so yeah?
OMOCAT BRING THIS TO AUSTRALIA YOU BASTARD
Only on console edition tho bc omocat screwed the OG supporters (PC players) over with content available on every platform but pc
Well, at least PC can just mod that stuff in, plus more
omocat told me that ortiel from the hit game and movie “cookie clicker“ will show up fr fr ong
It's probably the artist fault not Omocat's
Obviously Anime central, exhibit hall booth #205. . Check omocat's twitter if you don't understand what I'm saying lmao
My friend got me those on the Omocat website before they sold out!!
Tyyy!!!!
it's actually just the one from the official omocat shop!t5\31hpy:2463
I WISH LOL . OMOCAT, HOLLYWOOD PLEASE PLEASE HIRE MEEEEE
It probably was going to be canon that they reset/rebirth when they die in battle, but Omocat decided the lore would be better without it. Hence it being cut content
What if that artist is omocat haha no way... Unless..
i like the implication that omocat shouts "INSPIRATION HAS STRIKETH!!!" every time she draws something
what insration did omocat needed to draw basil on a watermelon-
Do your childhood friends not turn into watermelons and explode regularly? Real life is the best inspiration!
omocat is *both* of the artists in town?? the theories run deeper
If rococo is inspired by the artist.... Rococo omocat confirmed??!?! 1?1!!1! NO CLICKBAIT!!! 1!1!!!!11
I know but I thought this was why omocat choose a lightbulb as the theme.
That’s a pretty cool find, but I think the light bulb is just.. light bulb shaped, at least that’s what I believe Omocat intended it as
People have read into this before but I think it's just something you see in some neighbourhoods, I've seen shoes on powerlines before and always just assumed some kids threw them there for a laugh.. . Don't feel like Omocat meant for it to have a deeper meaning.
The attention to detail that OMOCAT has placed into this game is absolutely stunning. Doing a second playthrough now and seeing how many not-so-hidden hidden details I find is amazing. Great theory!!!
“Accidents happen, right?”
It’s selling your walls to omocat
I'm pretty sure it's because it's means "I love you". . 1 = I. . 4 = Love. . 3 = You
how is 4 love and 3 you
Love has 4 letters and You has 3.
To add on, this was something in Mr. Rogers' personal symbology. He felt that 143 meant "I love you" and actually weighed himself every day to stay 143 pounds.
and this theory also states that the 'i love you' meaning for 143 is still valid
Because it is valid? That’s what the 143 means… You’re overthinking it
Bro the OP just said that
I'm pretty sure that at the time I made this comment, the Op didn't mention anything about "I love you" so I commented on that.
Fair enough
143 means I love you. 143 is an internet slang numerical expression that conveys a message of love.
With all due respect, I highly doubt omocat cares that much about the defenestration of prauge
Because the "I love you" acronym
Isn’t Omocat a she?
whoops, i forgor to check the wiki before making this💀
That might just be a very strange coincidence, I think it was because of the number of letters in the 3 words
What exactly is your point here? Also, who is the ‘he’ referring to?
N...no? 143 corresponds to the number of letters in "I love you", to me, that's more obvious than whatever 214 is.
Ain't defenestration specifically about windows?
Yes
>!That's how many steps she fell down!<
jesus christ, how big is omori’s damn house??

Honestly this whole theory is weak. The reason for 143 being "I love you" is obvious, defenestration does not include pushing someone down stairs, and omocat is a she.
This feels like a minor stretch
Maybe because Fred Rogers used it as I love you? Not sure…
It's actually supposed to be I love you, but this is my new crack theory!!
Defenestration is a term used for when someone throws someone out a window. I don’t think anyone in this game got thrown out a window
How does 143 mean the pizza thing?
bravo ~~vince~~ omocat
I always thought that it referenced the number of letters in each world . . I (1) love (4) you (3)
It means I love you I think
We thought Omori was about moving past trauma and forgiving yourself, but it was really a metaphor for the Thirty Years War! It's so obvious now!
noone in this thread getting that its a joke lmao
omocat's a girl.
Autist here and I personally feel like he does but ultimately unless omocat confirms we’ll never know, especially since autism symptoms overlap with so many other things
Pay attention to everything, most things are tied together or have a secret meaning. Omocat and the dev team did an astonishing work at making everything feel cohesive.
Omocat just beat Sweathart in the most epic way possible, off screen
Among us is about to launch a coup against omocat
I thought omocat is dead but... She is back
Because Omocat lives in Cali ;n;
Thank you ♥️ I would kill to draw like omocat though 😂
Omocat really fell off.
i ordered it instantly no time to think about the financial reprocussions 😭 the artwork is so beautiful
Holy shit I am in so much pain what did I just do to my wallet
I couldn't do it, I want it so bad but I'm too responsible, it's so painful
Whatd you buy?! I didnt get this message!. . I want whatever it is!!!
[OMOCAT released a series of prints to celebrate the first anniversary of the game.]() Gorgeous but quite expensive.
I discovered this game around the start of the summer this year and haven’t looked back since. This community is so great and I’m glad to be apart of it. Merry Christmas and happy Omoriversary everyone!
Same, this community is so wholesome and enjoyable that I couldn't ask for more.
And the poster set is $143.
Heh I get it.
nobody is going to talk about how cool characters look at the top?
It looks like the old designs for the real world group
Rowan fans are feasting rn
this is just one of those times I wish I knew how to read
jokes aside, this is fantastic. . I've only known OMORI for 4 months but even so, it's still crazyyyyyyyyyyyy
> ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY . . Not sure how to feel, so many emotions, so many memes. . For the art, "Magnifique", as some wacky Europeans would say
Found this game around August, it has been a glorious ride of schizophrenia, amusement, sadness and more.. . Hell, I haven’t genuinely *played* it but I still love the community, characters, lore and so on
You should. I cried like a baby just because one frickin minute animation at the end of the true route. It's not the same if you're watching a video.
Fair, I spoiled myself cause I didn’t know how good it was and I just wanted context so I can’t imagine what a ride it must have been to fully play it
I spoiled myself too! I believe OMORI is the kind of game that because of its sensitive topics, some people must look out for some spoilers first, avoiding surprise triggers. Believe me, it's totally worth it! The game has so much love in every detail!
**this is fantastic!!**
i can just imagine omocat resisting the urge to draw kel with burgers on his mind
I thought there was gonna be more content added to the omori route
Congrats. Your game made me forever worry about you in everything you write, especially with sentences such as. . > Every time I'm happy, a part of me is waiting for all I have to slip away.
:)
Should I!?
I don't need it.... I don't need it.... i definitively do not need it..........
Damn this guys a fuckin poet
Aw man that looks so goo-. . \*checks price\*. . ... yeah, no.. . I love Omori, I love the dev's work, I love the dev's art but Jesus fucking Christ, no.
Really proud of OMOCAT and her team! They really deserved the award with how much Heart they put into the story of the game.
I'm excited for any other game Omocat wants to make!
wow Omocat is based
Basedil
Ok but itd be very funny to see omocat typing “hMhghsghrhhhghghh 🥺🥺😢😢😭😭 im so alone” for the next five days as she cry posts
omocat said they were going to maybe do things next year. but that’s next year
She’s gone mad
chainsaw BRRRRRR: one of the squid sisters. . whip crack: idk who uses a whip in game lol. . snaley explodes: snaley explodes . . cat screeching noise: experiment 667 broke out again
snaley explodes: snaley explodes
does more need to be said
SQUID SISTERS IM WHEEZING--
Surely* (damn it)
SNALEY NOT AGAIN!
This is what happens when you tell us to not drink oranje joe OMOCAT, those are the consequences of your actions
Omocat had to much Orange Joe.
IS THAT A CHAINSAWMANREFERENCE?!!1!1?!1!?1!1?1?!!?!1?1!!1!1??!!?1!?!1?!1!
The six year game development was stressful, I’m glad she’s having fun
Wow omocat really just got taken over by sweathart didn’t she
It’s all her fault the subreddits actin up
This whole Sub has become an advertisment for an Anime Bodypillow....  . How would I explain this to people?! "I just bought it ironically..."
“I just bought it because it’s a better way to end a bloodline then with my boring hammer made out of comets.”
Im genuinly curious, is this a warhammer reference?
It’s a reference to this obscure indie game called omori. One of the characters can equip an item called the comet hammer, however they can also equip a body pillow that does more damage.
her pulchritudinous face really shines in those photos, whew..
Lmao the location is headspace, I’m dead
Sweetheart hired a lab rat to take over the OMOCAT account
help i can't stop laughing for some reason
Capitalism
Oragne joe
No.
I kinda understand the other points, but being upset aboit the paywall is kinda unreasonable. The rest of the chapters were free which is really generous for anything Omocat creates, have you seen the prices of Omori merch?
omocat announces live action OMORI
OMORI would make a fantastic drama series
omocat amongus
omogos
Omorgus
When the OMOCAT is *SuS*
It does suck tho. . I tried the official omocat recipe and wanted to vomit
Twitter and Instagram, look at the Omocat accounts! On Twitter the Omori account reposts them :)
you cowards give us pet rocks
I am afraid the pet rocks are a DIY deal since they are vintage
"Pet rocks not included". . Sad, depressed, devastated even...
miserable because I'm a boss
^MANIC ^BECAUSE ^I ^CAN ^FIND ^ROCKS ^AND ^USE ^THEM ^AS ^FLEXING ^CONDOMS
the left is a mood
Agreed. Wish i had the money for it cause it’s hilarious
Link to the merch 
sad sad sad. . sad sad sad. . sad sad sad
I bought it cuz it’s the onlything that’s hasn’t been sold out yet
Best April fools merch
sadness
Is this an April fools thing? ( sorry if that’s a dumb question)
Yep! It’s exclusive merch just for today from 12:00am PST to 11:59pm PST
Aw
Borderline false advertising to tease the rocks like they did other merch, then include the rocks *again* in merch pics only to say in the fine print they’re not included. Makes you wonder what the purpose of the arm magnets are - they’re not that silly by themselves.... . Also pretty hard to justify passing this off as $20 value, but you know what they say about an April fool and his money.. . Also OP can you flair this as ‘meta’
WOOO I MANAGED TO GET ONE LMAOOO
To anyone who ordered it, have you received a shipping confirmation yet? Also it's been completely taken off their site instead of saying "sold out". Plus it said "we are offering no refunds for this" when/if you bought it. I feel like there's a mystery going on here.
If this is still relevant. . Yeah i got my confirmation mail a few days ago and its on the way
OMOCAT did
You can buy them in the Omocat store! 
Oh it's official merch?! Dope! Ty!
NP 
Please don't be a sad comic OMOCAT
Omocat was cooking when they made these
I knowww what the heck they are super cute
If that's the case, please hire me OMOCAT 🙏🙏🙏 /j
I think this is because a lot of the height comparisons made RIGHT after the new art was released were estimations. This still might be inaccurate though... sorry if it is!  . In the end I don't think Omocat wanted to stop headcanon heights, either, so this chart is more for fun than anything and not set in stone.
i found omocats account guys
DON’T LISTEN TO THEM, THEIR A SPY SENT BY OMOCAT, DRINK AS MUCH ORANGE JOE AS POSSIBLE.
OMOCAT's past 
what ? Did they do something ? :0 Or are they okay ?
Let's just say Omocat said and did a lot of things that involved little boys, after which she tried to cover it all up and claim she didn't mean what she said even though the evidence says otherwise.
Oh.. I thought she had a hard childhood when I saw that on the iceberg
i know that there is a video esplaining it but now i can't wacht it, could you please esplain the omocat past? you mean the drama around that shirt she made?  . . . and also what white serf style 6 is
Yeah, that's pretty much it for Omocat's past.
With some basic math, and assuming the caffeine in a cup of coffee is evenly spread throughout the liquid, authentic Orange Joe would be slightly over 87 ml of coffee, and nearly 463 ml of orange soda, assuming a non-caffeinated orange soda is used. Neither number is actually this clean, but even factory canning machines aren't perfect, any soda is going to fall within a certain margin of error between cans. So just using these exact numbers shouldn't significantly deviate from the taste of Orange Joe.. . For a number that can be used to make an arbitrary amount, it should be about 84% orange soda and 16% coffee. Of course, Omocat probably didn't actually do any math for a joke drink, and given I'm just using OP's unsourced numbers its hard to say how accurate this would actually be.
It's not by Omocat though...
Nice.. . I’ll never not be angry at Omocat for silently deleting this damn game from the store.
same. I’m still pissed over it.. . hopefully one day it returns, one day
Wait what happened?
wait what happened?
They took it off the store without a single word or explanation and haven’t expanded any further on it.. . I planned to buy it after my playthrough on gamepass but didn’t get the chance because of them.
Totally agree with you on that. If there was a way to buy it, I would. Just one minor correction: It is still available on the [PlayStation Store]().. . . . And both the Switch and PS4 versions are available physically as well on the [Omocat Shop](), so even if they were delisted digitally there still would be ways of getting them.. . Since Xbox never got a physical release, it's lost. You either bought that while it was on gamepass (a few lucky few), got it from gamepass and now is stuck with a game that does not boot or didn't even gotten the chance to play it at the time.. . So yeah, if they want our money bring the damn game back. Other than that I don't dwell on the morality of getting a similar version (Windows Store Version or Modded Steam Version) at all.
then OMOCAT and co. should send a DMCA if the mod creator is making a profit over their assets. i should email them about this.
Not making a profit over their assets, since no one is buying the mod, and any merch is sold without making a profit
what were omocat's plans for omori in the coming years?
I DIDNT REALIZE JT WAS OFFICIAL OMOCAT ART IM SOBBING
Oh no omocat is gonna become jk Rowling in the future.
This just fuels my need to try it.
Omocat it's too late, far too many souls have suffered the fate of orange joe
This is your fault, you dared them. I mean I did too but we don't need to talk about that.
You god damn hypocrite XD /lh
I will forever curse coffee for years to come.
I WILL PUT ORANGE JUICE ON MY COFFEE. . AND NOBODY WILL STOP ME!!!
*He was pronounced Dead 20 minutes later on January the 1st, 2022, at 8:20 PM.*
Their closest friends claim that the jam covering their body was part of some weird thing they were doing and certainly now a failed attempt to revive them
Oh that doesn't work damn
They must've used the wrong jam
Oh that explains it
No one can stop me
1984
Too bad I don’t have any orange juice :/    . . For now, I guess I’ll have to stick with chocolate joe or eggnog joe    . . Edit: I just had a dream where I made coffee and poured eggnog into it. Help
Wine joe
Waits its a legit drink?
Ye, omocat shared some OMORI-themed recipes on Twitter, an Orange Joe is just orange juice mixed with coffee
oh god, INTERESTING
I will drink orange Joe AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME
this is what orwell warned us about
Omorwell
You brought this monster into the world, now you have to live with it
please do not the orange joe. . . Edit: oh my god I just realize why it’s called orange joe. . . The joe part is a cup of joe, which can mean a coffee in some places.. . . I think we’re smart enough to figure the orange part out
… it’s because you mix in apple juice!
I NEED IT
Society can't tell me what to do
I am going to drink Orange Joe
the power of the governer is only as strong as the consent of the governed
I’ve sent hundreds to their death……. What have I done?
If it's any consolation, /u/DarkShadowYT21 said that they liked it.
true
fine i'll just have a glass of pilk
I don't like coffee and I don't like orange juice, so I'm probably fine.
Perfectly valid.
I already did it was ok
Literally 1984
I like how there's several replies to this tweet of people doing the exact opposite
A majority of them are saying they will drink orange joe
That sign wont stop me because i cant read!
Orange Joe

Too late
well now i fuckin have to.
DO NOT LISTEN, ORANGE JOE IS AMAZING.. . If you can get a decently acidic coffee it's honestly pretty good
I WILL NOT BE STOPPED
Too late OMOCAT, you can't stop us now
Please do not start the New Year off by killing yourself. Thank you.
Oragne Joe
I know a good recipe involving making syrup from oranges and peel and adding it to cold brew and carbonated water. Will post soon
looks like SOMETHING has hijacked OMOCAT'S twitter account!
#YOU CANT TELL ME WHAT TO DO
Well yes but actually no
Your mortal concoctions wont stop me, something that is immortal.
I will keep this in my mind once I'll have finished with medication that interacts with caffeine
Alright time to drink orange joe
I’m gonna try it
Too late
I already screenshot of the recipe and the others I’m gonna drink it no matter what
The only way I will stop drinking it is if you give me the recipe for those cookies I’ve been having a meltdown
Too late
Yea it's uhm... terrible, lol
no
Too late.
Aww but I was planning to x)
that ain’t gonna stop me. i hate coffee but imma still try it
i will do anyway
Don’t care ORANGE JOE FOREVER
i will c o n s u m e orange joe
Who's Joe ?
- .-
I literally just saw a while ago a post of someone drinking orange joe
It's too late
this is just like george orwells 1984
1984 by george orwell 1949
Oragne joe
Too bad
Well wtf omocat?. . I thought she was charging $35 for just the cartridge
I preordered for an extra 5 and it came with all thus
I ordered mine through the OMOCat website, haven’t gotten it yet… but my brother who ordered it through FanGamer got his already
Same, I pre-ordered a few weeks back from the omocat shop, I wonder when they ship
Is the one listed on Omocat and Fangamer the one that comes with the extra stuff?
Okie, I was confused because on Omocat it was listed as "Standard edition" but I couldn't see anything about a different version anywhere, I thought the one in this post might have been a deluxe
I didn’t think to ask my GameStop bc I had already preordered on the omocat website, then I got an email saying it would ship July 15 instead of July 1. Bruh I gotta grind the game out in a month basically cuz I ain’t got the time in college
No. No school talk. U make me sad.
😭 I can’t run from it forever
They aren't released yet, but they should be one the OMOCAT shop whenever they're released
Oh cool! I must grab one once they are released or it’ll be sold out!
They should come back as pre-orders like the other plushies did since they're in high demand. OMOCAT has already confirmed they will bring *some* items back (unfortunately not all of them tho).. . . Since they would be pre-orders it would probably take quite a few months before they even begin shipping them, but it's better than nothing!!
>!GOD FUCKING DAMN IT OMOCAT STOP MAKING ME CRY OVER THESE TWO!<
IM GONNA FUCKING CRY WHY DID OMOCAT MAKE THE GAME SO SAD
I think that would be much better, if omocat didn't change it
It would have needed a good build up imo. . If he just pulls a gun from nowhere that would have been weird
Like the truth who dorsn't make any sense despite being a good twist.
Wich one ? The Omori one is from the Omocat shop on internet
100% accurate Omocat confess that it's you
Thank you omocat for the game but we'll take it from there. This doesn't make any sense 
Why?
They’re too tall! No way an malnourished dude that hasn’t seen a single drop of vitamin D in years is 5’7”. Or maybe I’m just projecting since I’m only 5’8”.
OMOCAT needs to do something about it, it's her character after all.
I think the original artist should be notified as to what happened to their design as well.
Omori if Omocat was bad at character design
omocat knows what to do to activate ptsd
For real. I literally jumped when I found that. I was not expecting it
omori fans when they see a black egg shaped figure with three ends at the lowest part
8 years of preparation finaly paying off
Maybe you can contact with Omocat to arrange a deal?
It’s not so much an omocat thing and more so a Nintendo thing
how is it a Nintendo thing? If other game creators can make and sell full fledged GB/GBC/GBA games without legal issues, you should be pretty good.
That's cuz Nintendo hasn't seen them yet, and once they do, they will not hesitate to abuse dmca to remove them.
Nintendo does not fuck about
r/redditsniper
I mean, if Limited Run Games can do it, maybe Fangamer can as well?. . 
That's insane precision. Omocat should found your project
OMOCAT WHYYYY
Omocat works In mysterious ways
If you contact omocat they might send a replacement
Darn. OMOCAT should consider seriously going into charity.  . Try and keep responsively all of your remaining plushies out of reach so they don't get set upon by a cat or a dog next time.
It honestly kind of crazy how much space we successfully made on r/place.. . There is way bigger game subreddits on this sites and they faild to get a place or are so small that you need to zoom in real closely.. . And meanwhile we got two spaces with name for the game/subreddit and large enough to see without zoom.
While other subreddits exceeding us in numbers we exceed them in mental illness which make's us the more powerful subreddit.   .    . GLORY TO OMORI
Glory to Omori! 
LMAO
GLORY TO OMORI!!!!
Glory to Omori!
We were organized, communicative, aggressive, and very lucky. For how small this community is, we gained A LOT of ground.. . The amount of allies we had benefited us greatly as well, but that's because of communication.
The diplomats that helped secure Star Wars and Germany, big round of applause for them 
With great mental instability comes great communication abilities. . \- Uncle Ben
I was extremely surprised at the fact we could keep anything on the board. It's pretty insane when you think about how many people were participating in it.
And the fact that we were able to keep our place in the middle of the canvas is just unbelievable.
OMORI 💪💪💪💪💪💪
Another sub for a game with about the same reach couldn’t even keep a 3x10 space for more than an hour. I’m so proud of everyone here that defended with me.
We did put in a lot of effort and sleepless nights 💪. . Glory to Omori!
Yeah as a player of the osu community I kept seeing all of your guys art so now I will be checking the game out soon. Never would have seen the game otherwise.

&#x200B;. . 
So this is basically u/jifs-not-gifs but it appears on even more threads.
I’m so surprised that we had so much space on that canvas I’m proud of us
Omori did not succumb 
Glory to omori
I just finished Omori this morning and I love this game so much. I was really surprised how big Omori is cause I don't see it anywhere else besides people saying it's a must play whenever it goes on sale. Glad I took a chance and happy it's still so loved after a year it came out
GLORY TO OMORI!
we made the cut boysssss
i cant tell whether that pun was intentional or if my mental state is just that messed up


Noiceeee
Y’all went absolutely Bananas on r/place . In terms of quality and defense of space, I was so surprised and proud of this community. Going back for my 3rd play thru just because of it
I'm so happy! I love being in this community I only managed to.make a heart but it was still so much fun to take part in this even especially with the omori community! The omori reddit is really the only reason I have reddit!
Yessssssss
This made my day
. . Yayy
 The Omori characters are happy
I'm so happy rn
Words cannot describe my happiness.
I tweeted so many times at Omocat during the event and even after. At least it was finally noticed
Soon, Omori will take over the world
It really surprised me when i saw how much space we got  lmao good job everyone


LETS GOOO
AHHHH IM FANGIRLING HARD RN
 WOooo
That's so cool, the OMORI community made so much things. Amazing!
We also got the Taskbar icon! Hopefully Omocat saw that too.
Thanks for the game
Brad Armstrong my favorite Omori character
Wait, doesn’t that mean Omocat could sue this restaurant if she finds it? Orange joe is technically her creation.
I mean technically. But lets be honest here she has to,. . A. know that this is happening . . and. . B. Actually give enough of a shit to actually do something about it.. . &#x200B;. . I don't know much about her character but most indie devs tend to be more lax with thier creations.
I'm pretty sure the mixture of coffee and orange juice has existed before the publishing of the game and considering it's just a word play of the words "cuppa joe" and "orange", which isn't a special original copyrighted name, the case would probably be thrown out even if Omocat tried to sue them
Fair, was just curious.
Imagine how funny it would be if they learnt that all their suffering was not an accident but it was built by a group of people led by someone named OMOCAT just for the sake of making a game with a good story. . Bonus points if they learn about the vtuber thing and all the other endings or the subreddit
Truman show but it was the showrunner's passion project and their every scene is them rambling about it until truman's too tired to stand up for himself
Holy shit it's the real Omocat🤯
Who’s the artist for this year’s birthday set? First it was OMOCAT, then Nui, so whose style is this?
i think its omocats art cause it says omocat at the bottom but that might just be cause its the company. if its not omocats then its probably minced art
dawg omocat be making MAD bank
Welcome to Money Space.. . Only Omocat is allowed here.
No idea though omocat shop has a “Notify me when restocked” feature!
The Omocat Shop! All plushies are sold out though 
Nooooo I wasn't even aware they were out today 
right??. . omori could have been completely black as normal and white at 1 hp but instead its the opposite this hints at omocat trying to show black color as weak therefore being racist
the body pillow made me lough for some reason.    . . omocat never change please
Wow. . Is there anyone in this filthy planet who actually expected for OMOCAT to release a bodypillow?
Ah, yes, a bodypillow as a Valentine's special.. *Omocat really knows the members of this fanbase*
My thought process:"Hold the phone did omocat make a bodypillow?""Oh it's just a blanket, that makes sense."Scrolls to second image"AA-". . &#x200B;. . Also that keychain looks nice
It was only a matter of time until Omocat fucking snapped
I can understand delays, i can't understand ignoring every mail I sent to support. Love the game, screw the omocat store.
That's true , I can't defend that even if I wanted to, maybe they'll get their sht together this time who knows, hope your merch arrives soon.
Aw, that really stinks that that happened. As some random internet person, I can’t speak for OMOCAT’s shop or her team, but I’m really sorry to hear that.
OMOCAT NOOOO
ehhh that's a crime so it's not that unexpected, but if you are interested I heard omocat has a store on the deep web
Ok this is the moment, where I question Omocats motive.... . Just why?!
I can just imagine OMOCAT drawing this with a maniac expression
Looking at her bikini picture in the game, you can tell OMOCAT really amped her bust for that pillow. Not complaining, just something to notice.
OMOCAT knows the audience and I am disappointed in both them and the audience.
Omocat looking how everybody ignore hoodie and buy dakimakura
Ask Omocat :)
Good point actually :v. . But OMORI's age restriction is to either 14 or 16yo or older people iIrc, so that's not much of a problem. And if anyone under that age play OMORI and get traumatized because of it, it's not Omocat's responsability, but it is of their parents.
Well im only saying this cuz, well most of Jaidens fans are like 11-15 so im really worried about the people who are under age that would be getting g into this fandom
I love that OMOCAT isn't ashamed of OMORI's questionable origins
Omocats art has really improved
This is the equivalent of finding out Bruce Wayne is Batman. 
BRUCE WAYNE IS MAN? 
You’re not gonna believe who Superman **Actually** is! 
No fucking way
Nolimitsman*
KAL EL?????. . CLARK KENT???????
IS HE STUPID. . 
Is he stupid?
Goddamit Arkham...
I thought Bruce was in aslume city?
is there a lore reason?
WAIT BRUCE WAYNE IS BATMAN?!?!?t5\31hpy:2460
That feckless playboy? Psshhh, no way.
Theory confirmed: Omori is Batman
The butts match !!
No it's not
🥓
Those two are the only canon gay couple in the game.
I don't know, OMOCAT hasn't said anything yet about those two.
Who’s the guy on the left I forgot? I know who Pretty Boy is though
Jay (also knows as Jock)
Ohhh
Idk what this comment is trying to do lmao
Probably trying to annoy people who have LGBT hc lol
That's my guess lol. The queer shippers
Well they're not any worse than the hetero shippers 😂
No I completely agree. I am a queer shipper and yeah the heteros are just as bad (maybe even worse at some points)
As a fellow queer shipper I can confirm heteros are just worse on some point
Where’s this in game?
The two can be found at the playground on Faraway Town. Pretty boy can be found sitting on the bench and the Jock can be found on the basketball and both can be interact. On day three, the two can be seen having a conversation, you can interact with them to see their conversation.
Pretty Boy also gives you bandages when you talk to him Day 1 iirc
He really a pretty boy
He does.
I remember them but I had no idea about the comic
On the screen
Which one
Yours
I have two: phone and samsung smart fridge which one?
Samsung smart fridge obviously smh
You also don’t play on the Samsung smart fridge? It has some extra content
Fr tho... The hidden lore is insane i dont think people talk about it enough 🤯
Yeah definitely the ice cube boss lore is insane 😳
Nice, what's it all about?
Jock meets cute gay nerd, becomes gay.
wholesome story
You found it. . 
Paqoe
I VERFIED IT
Truly a silent clubstep moment
i wonder if the clubstep truly is silent
NEVER ask paqoe about mens mental health‼️‼️
I had no idea Omocat made the comic until just now. I knew it was in the game, but I thought it was just an artist who made it.
the meme comic... truly a relic of a cringier time
OMOCAT!???
Yoooo I remember reading this back in the day. I loved it.
yesss as a long time omocat fan i was so excited when i played the game and saw them :)
Oh god I truly thought this was Pursuit for a moment till I realized who these people are
U gotta give credit to the jock guys gaggle of goobers who helped him get laid.
It has existed for a pretty long time, so it's a bit odd that you learn of it now.
I did *not* know Omocat of all people made this. How am I just know realizing?! 

Wait, is it about homosexual?







HUH
Gay ass
Then who are the characters ment to be.. (Please no pro ships)
pro what
they are their own characters
Ok
yuckidy yuck yuck
Pretty femboy*
homophone
My favorite phone
i was testing this subreddit's bot if he was gonna delete or lock my comment
i fucking knew they looked similar
You don’t know how long I have been waiting for someone to say this.
I think in the character files, theirs is named "PB&J" or something.
wtf is the picture this is so gay
♥️
Omocat is to be a considered an anomalous object therefore it has no pronoun to be addressed by
Oh cool so you’re only telling me NOW that the skip we thought was a Euclid broke out! You KNOW it’s standard procedure to update a skip’s class to Keter when they break out! Do you know how many people could’ve gotten hurt?!
Stop this void entity right this instant!
Its a few dozen or hundred so lives no-one would notice
Just a note, just because something is Keter does not mean it's dangerous, just nearly impossible to contain reliably.
Yeah but OMOCAT is a humanoid cat type creature. She could be related to the Nine Tailed Fox for all we know! Do you want a K-Class Scenario on your hands? Is that what you want?
SCP:4729-OMORI
WE omor 
By it I'm referring to the name itself, not the person omocat as an it
Omocat is actually an ancient genderless deity roaming this planet forever.
before the first nation.... . . before the first tribe.... . long before the first human witnessed their own sentience.... . Omocat allready roamed our mortal plane.. . the universe tried to banish them in an event u might remember as the comet that whiped out the dinosaurs... but it barely weakened the deity for the loss of its dino-followers was just a minor setback for soon. . soon an ape started walking
Isn't omocat a girl?
nobody knows
My favorite part was when Omocat said "It's Omocatin' time" and omocated all over the place
I'll say it here, this doesn't sound as good as it did in my head before writing this lmfao
no no it's perfect
Omocat be like 143
Homed stuck. . 
I thought for sure Omocat was female.
She is
Omocat has awoken!
Wait omocat is a guy? I swear my brain forgets way too much. Edit: I just realized i am an idiot.
Omocating
This Is The Only Valid Answer
Why is my comment downvoted what did i do 💀
Idk mate 💀i think it's because you Said 'he' but idk
Reddit☕️
You are on Reddit bro
Oh shit you're right
I down voted because you were asking why
Yes omocat my beloved.
Omocat is back. All hail the Omor! 
Oh why omocat?. . Oh why must you take my stimmy?. . Why must I give in...
Ah yes, the special move of OMOCAT. . The MERCH DROP. . Deals 9999 damage to all our wallets(and us)
yes, it seems like it. omocat did announce that a full omori collection will be coming after the initial merch drop a week or two ago
honestly, not sure if omocat gonma make it a thing, ending >!seems to be made open ended om purpose afterall!<
Yeah, true. I’d really just love to see more of these characters in the future. Or perhaps another story that’s also set the Omori universe…🤔
definitely! i too cant get enough of the game as well :>
I think I'll speak for everyone: Please don't buy clothes in order to resell them, the stock is low and don't ruin someone's happiness in order to make profit,. . The Omocat (and Omori) community seems to be very nice and I hope that everyone will get what they want
Even Omocat was shocked as to how quickly the ships started lol, especially since I think there was only a trailer out at this time
I mean makes sense since Omocat made Pretty Boy
I'm crying and shaking rn Omocat would never say thaaat!!! 
Don't crying.
 Shippers when two people have good relations. (They must be secretly in love). . Also omocat knows her demographic is mostly LGBT gonna milk that shit like all corporations
Milk that shit? Bruh this is a years old tweet lmao. Please get out of your mindset that every time a piece of media has gay implications, it is just a way for corporations to make money off the "woke agenda".




The art was by OMOCAT. . But all of the edits such as the Bisexual flag were made by me.
She saw her little bro do it and now she wants to do it too
Lol
how do you know she's bi?
Omocat does. She knows all,
You wouldn't dare !
Omocat loves a good story, do you doubt her willingness?
Omocat on her way to start a war between Sunflowers and Sunburners:
Omori shippers: we like all of them except the most realistically healthy ones
It's not fun if it's realistic 
[Psssst]()… . . Edit I found [another cute one]()
We have the power on ao3
meanwhile sunblings supremecy:
I'm your average Sunkissed enjoyer who doesn't care about shipping discourse as long as you don't bother me. But if you do bother me, I will figure out how to roast your OTP after you said my OT3 is weird and wouldn't work out.
Sunkissed?

i love omocat's art so much 
Ah yes, the JUC box
love me some JUC
I think it's supposed to say "JUS".
REAL!11!1Q!1QS
[source]()
Ooo this is a really good find, this art style by OMOCAT is a lot different compared to a lot of the art in OMORI!!
Omocat wants it to be real and you know it 
It's not like omocat doesn't throw other ships a bone once in a while.
Seriously. Im pretty sure Omocat is just kinda giving moments for every shipper to enjoy at this point
As someone who likes a wide range of different ships, I really appreciate that!
Yeah i agree. Idk if i ever want any of the ships canon, tho i guess i have a preference for which one id rather be. Many ships is nice
I will set this as wallpaper for my next linux rice.. . 
Good job!
LETS FUCKING GO

Seeing these to together brings me happiness points 🙂
i love the new style but a part of me will always find this style just the slightest bit more charming 
**Plays Powerpuff Girls theme while reading comments like in a slander video**
Knowing Omocat, this most certainly isn't a Sunburn art, so I won't say "blessed" just in case.
What??? She makes tons of ship art lmao.
Did she draw this today?
Nope. . It was in 2014. . 
**get ready for a war!** /s
AWWWWWWW
Blessed 
Their name is on the bottom right
Begun, the ship wars have.

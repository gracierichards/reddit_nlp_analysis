Damn, not sure which shirt to buy. The Basil sweater is already sold out, lol.
But look at basil too, it seems like it's a representation of him "sharing" the pain with omori.
Got the Basil shirt as soon as it dropped!
Beloved Roselily shipping aside, I love Basil's shorts; I want a pair like that.
“Roselily” THIS NAME WARMS MY HEART-
From the first teaser email I had my heart set on basils shirt, I’m so happy I got to get it since usually all the merch sells out before I can even look at it
"Hey Basil can you lean forward a bit?". . "Why?". . "Nobody needs to be reminded of that."
who took the photo, if not basil though? 🤔

woah its BASIL from OMORI
OMG THEY MADE BASIL FROM OMORI REAL????.
Me when I see ~~Basil~~ any character.
That's BASIL from OMORI
Whenever I see basil on my screen my anxiety is suddenly gone
uh i think the motor neurons' reaction against seeing basil is giving a DOWN vote 
as of right now this is the most popular Omori meme of all time, Basil deserves the love!
Basil has trauma
>!revenge for what she did to basil!<
Basil become SCARED and HAPPY!
Basil as Asgore's Child real??????
Plus his castle is filled with vines, bushes, thorns and chainsaws. I'm sure Basil and Asgore would like to garden with him at times, but run away once he decides to prune his plants.
He empathizes too much with the child, Asgore can’t bring himself to turn him into a Basil-kebab.
Isn't Basil parentless? He probably has Polly assigned from government.
Polly said his parents hired her to watch him since they're always away if I recall.
I like this relationship. I feel like Asgore and Basil would be a great father and son
Asgore adopting Basil?...heh looks interesting.
Now hear me out ,Asgore adopts Basil-
Isnt Basil parents are dead?
Basil, tying the bedsheets into a rope: Ah shit, here we go again...
That's now part of his instinct,>! staging suicides.!<
"I didn't mean to; it's just   M U S C L E   M E M O R Y"
"it wasn't my fault it was just, it just became a hobby idk why i am doing this."
 "oh no i'm approaching sunny's body and picking it up". . \*basil hangs sunny's body\*. .  "What do you mean muscle memory?". .  "uh-". .  "How do you even know how to tie that correctly? Were you *also* involved in the murder of my honey sweetie darling gravy-chan!?". . \*hero shoves basil down the stairs and hangs both of their bodies above their beds\*
Spoiler tag didn't go through
LMAO DUDE
GODDAMMIT, I shouldn’t have laughed at that
They'll all get a turn eventually .\.
No, I swear that didn’t just make me laugh…. . >!lmao!<
\*basil drowning noises intensify\*
Basil glad he bedridden orelse this is going to be WWE matches
Fair enough lol, Basil is not gonna be happy about doing all this over again
At least we know that this didn't happen since watering Basil's flowers gets is an extra ending cutscene with sunny and Basil the only two people in the room. Meaning the others probably left.
fucking watch me. . you gonna name your child fucking basil/pesto??
I looked it up. Theres apparently like 16000 people named Basil
Gg, well played
Basil
It kinda makes sense, Basil is a plant and if you like plants you can name your child "Basil."
Yeeeeaaa les gooooooo Basil mama WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
looking cute might ignore basils mental issues later idk
polly really deserves some love for keeping basil alive and being there
People will say how is basil depressed 🗿
A lot of people think basil was depressed before “it” happened
Nah that guy was a chill homie
he was just a bit shy I think
The thing is, is that how he contributes to the story
sorry but I dont get what you are trying to ask english isnt my main language
Sorry, I suck at explaining
you werent that bad I just couldnt get it
He gay
That's not confirmed is it?
Its is confirmed 100% don't you read the news
I'm sure it's not, not that that's the point I'm making.
basils motherrrrrrrrrrrrr
Are Basil and Polly blood related? If not, dude’s really just living with a milf
>!Basil's caretaker!<
im Basil fr
heh heh i feel sorry for Basil XD
after that Basil questions reality.
And then flees faraway and finds some weird as robot monk and becomes a robotic green nija that can deflect anything
Basil: oh...o-okey then.
That one was not only a little bit of trolling. . . That was a medium ammount of trolling at least for Bagel boi
Considerable amounts of tomfoolery
Incredible ammounts of >!destruction of his mental health!<
*everyone's
i have to know if basil was in on it
"Y-yes I know it was a  prank hahaha... *Hides bloody scissors*"
maybe.
"the cameras right there!"
Basil had to do his ol' shtick again
"It was just a prank bro" - Basil
If Basil was in it he would would just chuckle nervously!. . . If he wasn’t he would probably have a mental breakdown. (poor child)
Poor basil
Poor basil
Basil x Omori is so gross. 🤢🤮
They're just friends.
Basil x Sunny tho
Omori fans aren't making porn and you really shouldn't let a vocal minority of the community ruin the fun for you anyway. Though there should be some limits to shipping, like, you shouldn't ship Kel x Hero because that's just weird and disgusting. But I don't see any problem with people who kin Basil and are also gay so they like to think that Basil is gay, too. I am bisexual myself and I like both Sunny and Basil so I just like seeing them happy together.
Nah, it was Basil in O2, I saw him walk away without reporting it
I can confirm for Basil, he hasn't said anything the entire game idk about sunny tho
I saw basil >!kill omori with garden shears in medbay!<
YURI X BASIL
>!Basil: Hey OMORI, uh why i***s MA***-!<
basil?
Basil =?
Imagine Omori breaking the fourth wall further by pointing up to the sky and telling Basil that this is only the first hour of the story
New Game Plus where Omori just goes "yeah I already knew that. Now come on it's time to grind for cans."
“Restart anew with all your trauma!”. . edit: did I just reply to an ancient comment
You need to wait for it to ferment first.
2 months, minimum.
Yup
did YOU just reply to an ancient comment?
Yes
Oh yeah he did
yes, yes he did
yup
Yes, you did
I think you might have
You can directly go to Blackspace as if nothing happened
Omori but it's film bloopers.
Omori: *thumbs up* "Good save, Basil."
Bruh shoutout to SOMETING for stopping BASIL from spoiling the twist.
SOMETHING is the real mvp of the story.
SOMETHING my beloved
>!Basil: "In that case, we need to do whatever it takes to cover up the spoilers... **whatever it takes**"!<
Ah yes . . . Omori 2
Depressing Boogaloo
Omori: And you know what happens to those who spoil things don't you basil. . Basil: Wai-. . Omori: THAT'S RIGHT, HELL!. . Basil: ***A-***
you're going to brasil
Tomato tomoto
Omori: That's right, HELL!  .          :
>!Join Abbi!<
>!That’s it, to Blackspace you go!<
Thanks bro, leave it to twitter to spoil the rest
Mf wanted to ruin the game so Omori went full dictator censorship and blacked everything
If you're not familiar with the character charts + other dev notes (which I'm sure is the case for a lot of people), it's not really that strange. Polly's broadly portrayed as a responsible, (likely) professional caretaker fo Basil and his grandmother, which has a rather broad age range (late 20s to before retirement age). I can see how people would interpret her motherly concerns about Basil to be her being significantly older.
That's the thing, she doesn't give off a professional aura. She looks like she knows how to do the job but is awkward doing anything out of it. Her dialogue mostly consists of not understanding Basil's problems and worrying over how to do so, like... a young adult. Also the way she speaks sounds more mature than a teenager yet not quite how an old woman would. Idk man she screamed 20s hardworking woman to me.
pov you are basil
I wish I was basil
"I am depressed,anxious over eveything,ptsd ridden over the ultimate crime and im alone and my old friends gone but got hot onee-san looking after me so worth it
That almost sounds like one of those ridiculous titles for a light novel.
Fuckin chad pfp, you even play fuckin twewy, literally the highest sigma
Very worth it
100% worth it, depression is temporary but hot onee-san is forever
🤨
Man I wish I could've >!hanged my best friend's sister and framed it as a suicide while the guilt haunted me for the next 4 years and anxiety filled my every living moment while one of my best friends relentessly bullied the shit out of me!<
down bad?
Down cataclysmic
thats a better interpretation
Very poor choice of words.
Bruh
im hoping you mean this as in she looks like she would be a good mom (considering his parents are nowhere to be seen at any point in the game in any capacity) and not anything bad
Or water to water basil
Thank goodness basils house is one story
Yeah that would prob be condiderd workplace harrasment.. . Obvs if she is fine with it itw okay i guess...aside from the whole basil being underage and prob 10 to 14 years her junior kek.. . But woof woof bark bark
If Basil wasn't gay as fuck, \^and in a constant state of pain\^ he'd be the luckiest bastard in the world. . Ftfy
She's basil caretaker or you know adoptive mom
Lucky Basil
Anyone who says basil is lucky, is a creep for thinking so. She's clearly like a mother figure to basil.
God damn basil
I feel she could have been a bit more important . . Espically with her trying to be kind to Basil despite all he's been through
Yay I got free stuff I got a unhealthy addiction, hours of my life having fun playing a game over and over getting all endings, hour opon hours looking at Reddit groups and fan art, on less tears to shed later cause I miss my old friends and looking at basils photo album makes me remember time I had with my old friends
There is a difference between an excuse and a motivation. Trauma is not an excuse. What Basil did was wrong. But it is a completely valid motivation, you can understand why he did what he did even if it was bad.
The same goes for Basil tho lol. . Maybe he wants both of them 
I like basil. I prefer sunny and Aubrey. But I like basil :)
well we are talking about Bagel here
Well yes but I do love Basil on his own!! (Sunny too, but we’re talking basil politics here)
i tldr'd it in [another comment]() but it's hard to feel more Grey abt a character we simply don't know beyond a surface level.. . we got to know everyone else thru lil comments or flavor text or even just the dreamworld, but basil? we never get to meet basil that deeply. how can any complex feelings come of that?
Because Lines like these "It tells you to follow its lead. It says... it's the only way out... It says... that everything will be okay.". . "You hear pacing, the crunching of the grass sifting back and forth. You think you see a figure pick something off the ground, but you’re not sure. You keep staring at the leaves overhead. Everything will be okay... You think... Everything will be okay.". . "You hear shuffling. You hear dragging... and creaking... and pulling. Something is happening, but you refuse to look away from the leaves. Your head feels fuzzy again. You bite your tongue and attempt to wake up one last time, but it’s no use... You’re still here.". . These are all in sunnys pov so it makes it sound like sunny didnt even know what was happening and was following basils lead and didnt even help the hanging part as he hears basil hanging her but doesnt look . . And about the lie basil unlike sunny who actually forgotten the accident (dissotive amnesia i think is the term) basil has full memory of it but refuses to tell them
Ohhhh i see i see. . I never found these lines myself in game or by searching around, that does help it make more sense
I'm not sure if I can speak for the first commenter but I don't like that dog cause it blocked the way to Basil's house at some point in headspace and I was really worried I wouldn't be able to water Basil's flowers cause I assumed that was a vital step to getting a good ending on my first playthrough.
I mean... You weren't *wrong*, but you weren't really right either
imo there's so fucking much of basil we don't know.. . - what happened to his parents?. - why was he scared of calling for help at The Incident?. - why was that his plan to help fix The Incident???. - what the FUCK trauma happened to make him distrust adults to the point that polly is literally in the dark and only maybe his grandmother understood and aspect of his life and she may have not even been awake for it all???. . people call basil annoying but i think his story is severely under-shown.. . we see sunny's side of the story. - his mom's absent. - his dad may have picked favorites w his own children. - sunny's always been a daydreamer. - sunny's become terrible at differentiating reality and fiction. . and all of this kinda explains shit like bringing a knife to the real life fight w aubrey, or him barging into other people's houses and just touching their shit.. . but what is basil's story of it all. what made him like this, to the point that talking to sunny (someone who didn't seem to respond verbally to things) was the most he felt heard and talked to??. . if sunny/omori's trauma reaction wasn't shared by basil, what was basil's reaction when *he* became a recluse?? did he ALSO have a fucked up version of reality from isolating himself in his room??? does he have a diary that explains himself more???. . the entire story of omori is set up so you don't know who basil is until the final third of it. it's set up so the whole process thru the deep sea and humphrey is more meaningful because it's easy to forget finding basil's ur Main Goal when he's someone u didn't ever meet or know.. . but when we DO meet basil, it's all plot related. we don't get to meet him like we do the other three. we don't get to see their quirks and personal growths and issues.. . - we learn kel acts how he is (like seeking u out to knock on the door) because even at the lowest after The Incident, his parents ignored him and went "What About Hero?". he's been framed to show the family attention has never been on him thinking abt himself, but thinking for others (obliviously and clumsily).. - we learn hero is the same in reverse, he "snaps out of it" after The Incident because of how kel was treated by their parents. his whole moveset is about helping keep others (and his own) HP up. it's kinda been frames he becomes a doctor BECAUSE of his mom, and if he wasn't a doctor he'd have been a chef BECAUSE if somebody else.. - aubrey has been shown to us to need to fend for herself. as a child she's more sensitive to the boys' banter because she HAS no one really looking out for her, and as she grows older she grows nails and claws and bites back with her own words when she never learned to properly cope with things. she wants to care about others, but she knows she needs to put herself first.. . but what do we know about basil and his history, *really*? if he's living with his grandma, what happened to his parents? are they alive? did they die? are they the ones paying polly to be an in home caretaker? when did basil move in to this city with his grandma in the first place???. . it's easy to hate a character who the plot relies so heavily on and yet we have the barest level knowledge of.. . does he even have hobbies besides plants and photography?
This. This perfectly encapsulates all of Basil's problems. He just wasn't explored enough compared to everyone else. Granted, that does leave plenty of room for fan interpretation but the base game should have really let us know more about him.
Hopefully some of the switch exclusive content gave give us some more info, Basil seems to be a big focus in it.
from what i've heard, unfortunately not. it seems like basil joins for a boss rush thing maybe??? the discord talked a bit about it, but i'm planning on buying the Not Yet Released physical edition (i like to collect physical copies of games that make an impact) so i hadn't tuned in all that deeply.
Ratio
>!for me it’s that the way the real world version of Basil tried to save his friend was shockingly elaborate and twisted. Staging a suicide was the sickest possible way to cover an accident up.!<
Omori lore
this is a really good analysis on basil i love and care him so much and i didn't know how to put that into words until now LOL
Wtf, comments deleted, wtf happened here
aw no really?? i really liked the thread. . it was a big analysis on basil and i guess they deleted their account or something
I'm interested in why you think Basil is queer-coded? Personally I haven't seen any, but if you have any reasoning beyond him being clingy and him having some traditionally feminine aspects I'd love to hear it.
I understand what queer coding is? Don't know where the miscommunication happened there.. . But I was kinda afraid it'd be that answer. Granted he absolutely could be but I think it's odd to consider it "obvious". Being emotionally vulnerable and open to me is simply breaking a harmful masculine steortype. I dont think it should be used to determine if a character is gay
I mean, fuck, i do find him real cute, but I have no reason to actually believe he's gay. That's just pure toxic and stereotypical
>pale skinned, blond haired, blue eyed, emotionally available sensitive character with traditionally feminine hobby's. . Try not to assume emotional guys are instantly LGBT+ challenge IMPOSSIBLE. . Most of what you have just listed are some of the worst kind of gay stereotypes possible. From the physical characteristics that anyone could be born with to Basil showing any level of comfort towards his male friends, it's honestly sickening as someone who has been openly gay since their teens and has lived in the 1990s.  . Omocat making the Pretty Boy comic doesn't equate every feminine guy she makes as gay, that just doesn't make sense logically.. . We have no reason to assume Basil to be gay in actuality, it's all just harmful stereotypes that people try to press onto basil and which were created by homophones to generalize gay people. The fact that you're using it to justify Basil's sexuality is laughable at best.
IMHO, just because it's based on harmful stereotypes doesn't mean it's not happening. Social coding will always be dependent on what the majority understands and perceives. If most players perceive Basil as a gay boy (btw I'm not sure this is the case, just hypothesizing) because of his feminine traits and emotional personality, then that would configure him as a queer-coded character.. . Yeah, that's not ideal, and we should push against toxic stereotypes, but, alas, that's my opinion. :>
I agree people will believe what they want, but I think the game itself pretty obviously gives no actual evidence of Basil's sexuality. People can try to legitimize their headcanons with random evidence that has no logical basis behind it other than what other people might believe, but in the end it's no more credible than horoscopes. Just pseudoscience.
I was never accusing you of being homophobic, and I never meant it to be interpreted that way.  . I'm accusing you of using bad stereotypes of gay people that misrepresent what a gay person is in order to justify Basil's sexuality, which is naive but not homophobic.  . You can relate to Basil in any way you want, but I take issue with anyone declaring Basil to be gay in form except your headcanons. Omocat very intentionally left sexuality out of her game and focused on friendships instead because otherwise it would distract from Omori's actual meaning. Hero and Mari are a great example, because we don't actually know if they were dating or not. They could have just been close friends that had feelings for each other. I think Omocat designed her story like that for a reason.  . Sunny and Hero's sexuality are the only ones we can infer, but even those are contested. I only wish people stop projecting sexuality onto characters like it's fact.
>I never stated it was a fact,. . No but you implied it a few times.  . . . >**but I do think Omocat was SAYING it without saying it,** and of course lgbt kids aren't exactly the popular kids at school. . Which is really what I was stating with the words “like it’s fact”   . I appreciate that you did clarified it as personal interpretation several times in your original post, but I’m really just taking issue with the stereotypes you’re using to justify Basil’s sexuality. You’re welcome to continue believing what your believe as much as I’m welcome to criticize it. No hate, I just needed to push back on those points.
As I've said before, the problem is that you have either misunderstood this entire conversation from start to finish, or your too young to actually know the difference between a theory and a fact.Until I know which of these is the case, we'll never be able to resolve this matter. What's more, I don't really care to resolve it since doing so would be a huge waste of time for something that you either already agree with but have somehow misunderstood from the beginning, or something you'll eventually come to understand as you get older.  . Also, a bystander (like Basil) should not determine a relationship. They can observe it, and give their opinion on it (like Basil did) but ultimately Basil doesn't get to decide if Mari and Hero are dating.
Lmfao this was never about the difference between theory and fact, and was about you trying to deny that Omocat even tried to imply Mari and Hero were in a romantic relationship through her writing.. . >Also, a bystander (like Basil) should not determine a relationship.. . Oh use some context clues for once. If Basil is calling them a couple in the photo album all his friends get to see I think it's obvious everyone knows they're a couple.
Fuck off, he's gay af. You're just weaponizing homophobia to be homophobic and erase his queerness
[I encourage you to study up on LGBT+ stereotypes](), otherwise you come off as super ignorant and no one is even able to understand you, let alone pay attention to you.
wtf are you on?
You may live to see manmade horrors beyond comprehension. . 
Well queer coded isn't specifically for queer characters, being non confrontation, soft, liking flowers and being shy are traits stereotypically given to gay men/gender non conforming amab.. Queer coded are for characters that holds lots of traits stereotypically given to queer people.
Not really? Queer coding is done to hint at a character bring gay through certain aspects about them. If those aspects are done for a character who isn't actually gay, then it's not queer coding.
Not necessarly, queer coding can be done unnitentionnaly by the creator, especially if it's rooted in bigotry, like lots of older Disney villains have queer connotations, but where not written to be queer.
Queer coding has a super long history of being used not just to hint at a character's sexuality, but to give them particular visible traits in order to hint at other invisible traits. Disney queer codes most of their villains, though none of them are outright being shown to be hyper feminine, flamboyant, or gay in any actual way. Gaston is even confirmed by designers to be queer coded, though he's explicitly straight, per the narrative, but that attempt at hyper masculinity and constant over-compensation was seen, at the time, as a gay trait. It has some of its roots in the Hayes code from early Hollywood, when it was against the code to display overt queerness in media. . . [Here's a good and quick video on it](). The definition up front even explains that it doesn't have to be explicit, and that it doesn't have to actually imply they're gay.
Nothing in the game says anything definite about sexuality for any character. It is up to the player to see how they view them, so here are my thoughts.  . . . Basil is pretty androgynous and doesn't stand out as either a girl or boy too much. The name is also pretty neutral. This basically describes a lot of non-binary people and how many are in that neutral/androgynous zone. I also found that flower crowns are a subtle symbol for being an ally or part of the queer community. Lots of celebrities who are allies or queer have worn them, and or people have edited them on in photos. I have also seen them on many queer-coded characters in shows and games as well... either canon or as popular fanart.
Not sure if you meant that using he/him pronouns rules out being non-binary, but many non-binary people use pronouns other than they/them like only he/him or she/her, or even a mix of he/she, or he/she/they. But yeah, I think its pretty unimportant in the story overall other than to add onto the bullying/isolation of Basil.
Everyone starts somewhere, and learning about the community is challenging if you arent apart of it yourself, so dont sweat it as long as youre trying :). . Though I will say that most trans people dont want someone without permission to say their deadname. I know its just online, and I probably wont ever know Emma, but the idea is that I would never need to know Emma’s deadname, so why say it yknow?
This is such a good analysis that I'm bookmarking it. Thank you
It should not be possible to be this fucking based. I love seeing long, analytical takes like this.
👏👏👏
>!He was a 12 year old put into a situation where he just saw his best friend kill their sister. It's not like he thought deeply about the ramifications of what framing a suicide entails. He was stressed the fuck out, and I don't think I need to tell you people don't make good decisions in those types of situations, especially not children. He immediately regrets doing it the moment he realizes what he just did. The game really shows you just how utterly ruined he is afterwards.!<. . >!This does raise the concerning question of why the hell would a 12 year old's first instinct be to frame a suicide in this situation? Like seriously Basil, what the shit happened to you? Don't fucking tell me you've been having suicidal thoughts at that age...!<
i don't think it's all that unrealistic or rare for a child that age to have suicidal thoughts.. . As concerning as it may sound, it might be true, it is hard to deal with those feelings when you're not mature enough to properly process them.
>!Yeah, I get that and I don't blame Basil for not considering the consequences of his actions, it just leaves a really bitter taste in my mouth that he did the most fucked up thing to protect Sunny but seemingly (we don't really have information on that) doesn't even care about Mari or the fact that she might still be alive, sunny was too mentally unstable to take appropriate actions but what is Basil's excuse to not call an ambulance and staging a suicide as first impulse? !<. . BTW, it should go without saying, but I don't intend to engage in a serious arguement with strangers about fictional characters, I'm just curious about the opinions of others and I don't intend by any means to offend people who have different opinions than I have
Yeah I'm not his biggest fan over this, who knows what would've happened if Basil didn't guide Sunny through all that
>!Basil had to do something horrible in order for his amount of guilt to be as bad as Sunny's, they both did something horrible, but that doesn't make them horrible people.!<. . >!As someone who's been through a very traumatic event, at the time it was happening nothing felt like reality, I was entirely in self-preservation mode, as if I was in a nightmare. I made a lot of mistakes because I couldn't think straight, I just wanted to get out of the situation. !<. . >!To me it makes sense Basil would impulsively do something drastic out of fear of losing Sunny. !<
Wait, what
You've finished the game... right?
waitwaitwaitwaitwait. I thought >!Sunny staged the suicide, and Basil photographed it. Did I interpret that scene wrong? It was all disjointed photos, but Basil being the photographer, I thought he was the one taking the pics (because he didn't know what else to do). I would argue it's far from elaborate, though. He was in a panic, and a child. And, from what they've probably seen of death, if you cause one, you're in trouble, and since she fell, she probably had wounds. The only way for a death to occur that isn't punished, from their limited knowledge, was for it to be self inflicted. Regardless of who did it, I could absolutely not blame them, being as young, traumatized, and panicked as they were. People have done far worse, far more elaborate, and far less sensical things in similar states.!<
Well I don't know the spoiler thing but SPOILERS AHEAD. . . . . their was a thound better ways to do it n.1 make as if she triped as she has a bad knee and it wasn't that hard to lie saying "her bad knee made her trip and she fell" . Or just calling the ambulance she probably wasn't dead as hell before the hanging
Calling Basil a psycho is just stigmatizing actually psychopaths, he has no characteristics of a psychopath. . . >!Again mental illness doesn't correlate with doing bad things and the story does enough to give us Basil's perspective on things and even Sunny does have a view of him that doesn't paint him as the evil guy the haters make him out to be. He might have done somethingbad but that alone makes him not bad and that is true for Sunny as well!<. . >!Basil made the situations worse for Sunny than before, but it isn't like Sunny had anything against this idea, since he helped with the cover up. He didn't wanted to believe he killed his own sister and didn't wanted to live with that. Basil, who understood this made the plan with empathy in mind. Basil's problem isn't a lack of care, it's him caring too much and doesn't actually have consequences for the actions people take against him or others, which is why he does not fight back for most of the story. Also the reason why he didn't said anything was so that no one would hate Sunny and though it seems like he doesn't care about them, I see it as him not really feeling deserving of their friendship after what he did. Obsession is also the wrong word, because he never forced Sunny to be with him, he didn't even broke into Sunny's home in all these 4 years and in the end accepted Sunny moving out, if we can go by the good ending.!<. . The differences you want to point out has many flaws in their arguments:. . >!1. We see a lot of Basil being haunted by it and though it can be see from Sunny's perspective, I think it's due to him understanding Basil very well and knows that he also didn't liked what he has done. . 2. Sunny is also under a different position than Basil. He has pushed Mari and knows that it was him until he repressed it, while Basil could never have believed that, he believes that something did it and as such his view on the event is obscured and not accurate. He does not know it was Sunny, only unconsciously, but he was under the delusion that it was something else. Basil could have never told anyone really anything, that they would also have understood. Kel, Aubrey and Hero would have been more confused by his explanation than anything or come to the conclusion themselves, though mostly they would get him therapy sessions. He cannot speak up the truth because the full picture has only Sunny, who has the best memory of the group.. 3. His fear of departure is due to being left truly alone after Sunny is gone, and he doesn't want to deal with all the stuff he did on his own rather than wanting to possess Sunny.. 4. I disagree that Basil doesn't have redeeming qualities; For one we do see a lot of good qualities of Basil throughout the story, with the headspace, the black space and the real world, both past and present as well. Basil obviously cares for the group as he made the photo album, grew flowers for each of them and in the end was the one to encourage Sunny to come out after he was unconscious as Sunny knows that deep down, Basil shares the same anguish as him and both know what has to be done.!<. . >!Ultimately Basil is very complex and he actually is one of the most interesting characters, but the qualities you seem to not really see in Basil are parts of what makes him who he is. He is the soft boy angel, he is also the bagel you love to eat, but he is also the one to lie about what his best friend did and made that many times worse than it already was. I think his kindness is not a bullshit thing, it is a huge part of him that shouldn't be denied when viewing his character. Basil and Sunny are shown to be good people who did bad things, but they ultimately are able to undo that damage. That is how I think the game wanted to make us see it, after all Sunny and Basil are both important for the best outcome of the story and without either one of them, there is no good ending.!<
110% agree! During stressful situations, everyone reacts differently. Flight, fight, freeze. Then there's survival mode. Then there's rationalizing... . . Everyone here is putting a lot of pressure and expectation on a 12 year old who likely hasn't encountered death before outside of going to a relative's funeral or losing a pet, so knowing the consequences of his actions isn't something he's going to think about in the moment of trauma. Also, the fact people call a 12 year old a psycho because he doesn't, in the moment of someone's death and coming to grips with his friend's responsibility in the literal minutes afterward, when he is so used to being alone, is honestly a drastic take. >! His parents aren't around, he's constantly taken care of by a nanny whose primary focus is on someone more in need, his grandma, so he has to fend for himself and has few role models. Kids aren't equipped with the same knowledge adults are, so they'll focus on what's most important IN THE MOMENT. For him, it was making sure Sunny wouldn't be branded a murderer for what was an accident, but to a kid, killing is killing. There isn't time to reason out the nuance or philosophy when you haven't been trained. Even adults panic under stress. !<. . IMO, Basil is a lonely kid who beats himself up over things he has no control over. >!His absentee parents, his grandma dying, the SOMETHING that he believes was behind Sunny's shoulder and killed Mari... he's even beating himself up enough that he thinks suicide is his best course of action to take the secret to the grave, unless you intervene. !<. . What I think is important is even if people hate Basil, that's valid. Because Basil, IMO, would agree with them. That hateful reaction is exactly WHY he feels the way he does. He would've internalized those opinions that he's demented, psycho, or a monster. >!Basil may not have understood the consequences of his actions as a kid, but as he grew older, he saw himself as broken and guilty and he believes his only redeemable quality was he thought he was doing "the right thing" at the time. And he holds on to that belief because if he doesn't, then all the pain he witnesses his friend going through afterwards was meaningless. !<. . I know a lot of people thought it was unfair and cruel >! for Basil to keep it hidden, but ultimately  he wasn't the one who pushed Mari. Sunny was in shock and unresponsive after he cried when they put her back in her bed, so Basil, having few role models to emulate and likely little experience in an emergency, panicked and did his best in a situation like this. !<. . Is it an excuse? No. But does the Basil hate actual justify and contextualize his reasoning? Yes. And if it means he thought he'd protect Sunny from the same hate and accept his bad ending? Absolutely yes.. . Plus, I have to respect him for not revealing the truth, because >! it wasn't his place to tell everyone Sunny's secret. That had to be Sunny's decision. And what no one else knew, even Basil, is that Sunny couldn't remember. So to Basil, if Sunny wasn't telling anyone, then he assumed that keeping it as secret was what Sunny wanted. It's only in the good ending, where Sunny tells everyone himself, that Basil feels a weight off his shoulders and his own SOMETHING disappears. !<
Omori fans either want to gang up with Aubrey and punt Basil, or they baby him so much it's annoying and just makes people hate Basil more
What if i think all the characters are epic?

&#x200B;. . 
good bot 
Based.
Then you are right.
This is the one objectively correct statement.
I think ever person in the og friend group has done some bad so... spoilers . . . Kel-he has a hard time understanding emotions (least bad BTW) . . HERO- bottles up his emotions and lashes out on others . . Mari- seemingly is a perfecionist and here's a wacky theory she only dated hero bc he was perfect (80% I'm wrong on this) . . Aubry - her whole life after the 4 years can be sumed up to this one line "You followed your wrath" as she bullies basil with out letting him talk why "he" destroyed the pictures . . Sunny and basil - do I even need to talk about those 2 their easily the worst (basil worse tho)
Yeah I remember when like a year ago more, when OMORI was new, nobody hated on Basil. At least it wasn't a trend.
Good times, then everything changed when the hate nation attacked
Yeah I remember when like a year ago more, when OMORI was new, nobody hated on Basil. At least it wasn't a trend.
You posted this twice :|
Basil being buried alive six feet under with a white phosphorus IED ticking next to him, for starters.. . /s
basil's so feminine he gets affected by misogyny
Same. He's enjoyable, and serves his purpose in the narrative well. But as a *character,* he's definitely not one of my favorites (mainly because the others are just better fleshed out, and the time I spent with them helped me grow to love them all organically).. . Aside from how little we actually learn about him, I think the biggest thing that always put me off is how forcefully the game tries to condition you to feel protective of Basil at the start. The fight with BOSS, while an interesting narrative juxtaposition with Aubrey's first encounter, only exists to distract you from how complicated the situation between Aubrey and Basil in Faraway Town was. I didn't buy it for a second, and knew their was far more going on than the game showed us at first. Once we got to the fight at the lake, it was increasingly obvious just how much Basil was hiding from us, and how little Aubrey and the Hooligans were actually doing to him. When she finally screamed at Basil about "what he did", I stopped viewing him as the true victim.
And also the way that in the beginning Aubrey said she wasn't the one who started it also made me feel like there was something Basil wasn't telling us about
Um, what? The game shows multiple times that the hooligans do actually bully basil? We see him litreally get attacked by them in the very first rw cutscene? Also, besides the thing they are getting mad at him for is pretty dumb (aubrey already fixed the photo album) that's not to say I hate aubrey emotions make you do dumb stuff but saying basil was actually never a victim reduces the situation so much
I've seen some people misinterpret Basil as something he doesn't want to be, a killer. Examples are that one video which is a MGR meme compilation on YouTube, the part where Armstrong repeatedly punches Basil. The others even agreed because someone said he killed someone, even if they didn't play the game. But if they played the game, they took that misinterpretation too far. That's what I find slightly annoying, they don't even know what Basil's been through. He lost almost everything, and they just agree that Basil is a killer and he deserves to be punched a lot. How could they know what was Basil's state of mind? A very while back, I was using Reddit in a browser, then came here after 8 months to monitor most of the comments relating with Basil. I just observe and I won't interfere. . . Another comment here in this post said if those kinds of people were Basil, they couldn't bear what he's been through.. . I'm just 50/50 with Basil. I don't hate him and I don't really like him either, but this is getting ridiculous. I just have sympathy for Basil, that's all.
Not trying to hate on Aubrey or anything, but I feel like the people who hate Basil and defend Aubrey are hypocrites. Aubrey deals with her trauma by joining a gang and then treats the guy who's sister died like she's the only one whose hurting? Pushing Basil into a lake when she didn't know the whole story? She got better (obviously) and said sorry (she's a good person deep down and obviously had no where else to turn to with an absent father and distant mother), but she still did things wrongs though to a lesser extent, and so did Sunny and Basil. The only people who are 100% innocent here are Kel and Hero. Again, NOT HATING ON MY PINK-HAIRED FAVORITE, but Basil hate is so disproportionate in terms of "whose the worst". I really think the fandom is becoming something intolerable and honestly, it was expected considering what happened with Undertale.
Basil AND Aubrey do a lot of messed up stuff. Fighting over which one did worse things is pointless
Here is the thing: Aubrey didn't explained herself at all, she didn't told them what happened, so of course no one would understand her, especiallywhen Kel asked her multiple time why Basil did to her and yet no answer comes. Besides the fact that what Basil did doesn't warrant her thievery at all, which is the actual reason why she didn't even said anything;it was wrong and she knew it, not because she was dismissed. A stubborn person like Aubrey would not be incapable of being upfront, but since she did something bad, it's hard to justify it. . . Kel didn't need to understand this, because the Photo Album belongs to Basil and not her, even Hero didn' tgot the explanation from Aubrey until much later, though he was a bit more empathetic and had Kel been a little less harsh to her, they would have made up much earlier. This part I agree with, but the blame lies on Aubrey mostly. . . Kim punched Basil the other day and wanted to throw him out of public space. She has no right to act like an innocent girl at all. She should have just said we won't do anything bad to Basil, but she didn't, because she gives a damn about him. The fact that she started a fight with Kel is proof that they have not the best interest at heart for Basil. . . Wasn't Basil still crying until Aubrey had her whole rant how everyone is terrible and abandoned Mari? Even if not, it is not up to Basil to explain it, since the Photo Album is his property and saying now what exactly happened is not the best time. Besides the fact he made many attempts to explain himself to Aubrey with her scoffing him off brutally, I think that Aubrey is at the very least 80-90% responsible for all of the fights, all of them started by her.
Becoming in tolerable? Like Undertale's fandom? Lmfao if this Basil hate is the worst you've seen, you haven't seen anything yet. Most of the Basil hate is from people who aren't even super into the game.
Basil hate isn't the worst thing I've seen. I never said that? I've been in a bunch of fandoms, I know that there's TONS of worst stuff out there.
It was heavily implied by you complaining about the Basil hate and then leading into complaining about the fandom. We're still far from Undertale at the start of the fandom.
i think basil is a pretty cool fella
I have a neutral opinion on Basil. Yeah, >!covering Mari’s death as a suicide!< was pretty fucked up, but he paid the price. In the >!Basil boss fight, Basil’s something eating him is literally his guilt eating him alive.!< His grandma, friends and parents all left him while he tried to reassure himself that everything was okay, being a prime example of toxic positivity. Not to mention one of his old friends Aubrey started to bully him and gathered other kids to bully him too. He went through so much. He should 100% be held accountable for >!hanging Mari!< but he shouldn’t be shit on, or babied either.
basil is my favorite character leave him alone
Most of them are Sunny's POV, but this photo description specifically seems to be Basil's. "Who would be able to forgive **him** \[Sunny\]?". . There isn't anyone else that "him" could be referring to - it can't be Basil, because Basil hadn't done anything yet.
That, I can understand. Especially for a video game character, where all their woes are coded and can't affect the world.. . But let's be frank, he still >!covered Mari's death!< even if he's 12, worsening the situation and dragging the drama for about 4 years until Sunny walks out. Besides, the game gives most of the limelight to the other three friends, and the most we managed to overtly see Basil is in Blackspace, which is Sunny's thought about Basil. The game does everything in its power to tell us that Basil has a part in Mari's situation and little that overtly sympathize with the flower boy.. . Yes, signs of Basil's suffering are all over the place, but it takes second place in the drama of others.. . Because of that, by the second time I fight Basil, I was wishing Sunny would shove a knife between Basil's eyes. And I once considered the ending where Sunny >!let Basil die!< the canonical ending of the game because the two bastards got their comeuppance.
The Game centers more around Basil than any other characetr other than Sunny. . . The game introduces Basil's character as the kindest person in the group and his disappearance starts the plot of Omori's biggest arc :Search for Basil. . . From there we also focus on helping Basil with his real life problems and the most important events in the real world are all about and surtound Basil. . The game does very little to prove that he hanged Mari, only did it hint us at him being the closest to the truth and then revealing to us what happened.  By the time you confront him about it, his view is completely distorted. . Really? The game goes on its waybto make you empathise with Basil and make you care about him as they show him as the kind and gentle person in the very beginning of thr game and as a victim of bullying, the game id more sympathetic towards him than it is to any other character, except Sunny. . . Also no character was as traumatised and suffered from Mari's death more than Basil. Sunny could escape into his imaginations, but Basil's problems did not and had to life 4 years with this knowledge, whereas Sunny suppressed it. The others suffered,  but they didn't bear this cross on their back and had many ways to deal with it like finding nee friends and succeeding in life. . . If you really wished Basil death for Basil, then I ask myself if you really cared about the game's themes and message, because that line of thinking is frequently shown as evil and not really fair and just at all. This tells me more about your flawed views than that of Basil's and even then, it's in his case trauma and delusions, not malice.
I think the game does show and empathize with how characters deal with the Mari incident. However, I still do think that the game still empathizes with others more than Basil, at least on a surface level.. . While the game introduces Basil as the sweet kind flower boy, it's in Headspace. It's a dream, and dreams suffer from inaccuracies and personal biases, even if Sunny has photographic memories. . . While most of the plot, in both real life and the dreams, focuses around helping Basil, Basil himself is seldom shown. Even if he does, he's shown to be a target of Aubrey's rage, which is when the limelight shines on Aubrey and why she picked on the boy instead of... well, the boy.. . On Day 3, we go out and retrieve Basil's photo album, but we're shown that Aubrey becomes a bully, how Kel has grown up, how real life influences Sunny's dream, and how Basil is connected to >!Mari being six-feet under!< (which can be misinterpreted as Basil threatening Sunny, according to one of my friends.). . Most of the limelight is on Kel, how he changed (or not changed) throughout the years, and how there are clues about how Aubrey is actually feeling, because the former is trailing us and the latter being the bastard of the day. . . Basil got delegated into an NPC quest giver who shows the worst excess of his mental trauma.. . Day 2 begins by building up on Kel again, showing more of his rare maturity, sprinkling clues about Hero and how he dealt with Mari, then showing what does Aubrey think about all their old friends suddenly returning and pinning the blame on her, with the limelight pointing that Basil is responsible for her problems. Then it continues with Hero living up to his namesake, showing how he is the most outwardly mature of the old group, how he still hasn't moved on from Mari.. . Basil got delegated to being a talking statue, plot device and deadweight, in that order.. . Day 1 begins with the gang finally finding out what mental trauma climbed up and died in Aubrey's, how she found some modicum of peace by moving on to new friends, and how she still cannot let go of the past. It also shows why she felt betrayed by the gang, because when your only family is an emotionally abusive mother who is catatonic and a father still finding milk for her, and when your group of friends got shattered, well, shit.. . When the limelight finally gets back to Basil, the gang walk into Basil's home where Polly tells them that Basil fucked off to the hospital for in-universe reasonable reasons. They all say "eh." and return adventuring.. . When he returns, he fucks off into his room for reasonable reasons until the plot demands that his trauma would be good for some drama. >!Then he turns Sunny into a comatose pirate.!<. . While the three friends got time and time developing them as characters, Basil is an over-glorified plot device who's main shtick is acting cute, scaredy-cat or insane and facing enough near-death experiences to majorly harm his already diminished mental capacity.. . That does not mean that he doesn't have a character. That does not mean that he is not suffering. That does not mean that the game doesn't show said suffering. I think the cute/scaredy-cat/insane switch is a very good indicator of how he is managing himself.. . But you have three teens or young adult who manage to move on from the horrid ordeal one way or another and are following you versus an NPC who has absolutely not moved on yet and freaks out every time he and Sunny end up within a 5m radius unsupervised. I personally think the former cases are more interesting than Basil's.. . This is not an attack on his character. This is a biased comment on how he is portrayed in the game, and frankly I don't see another way to do it without rewriting the game. He is never shown to be recovering because his personality and his circumstances don't allow it, and the plot *hinges* on him finally snaps. . . You don't see him accepting shit unless you go for the secret good ending, in which he smiles.. . Once.. . Implication of recovery, but not a confirmation.. . TLDR: Hero, Kel and Aubrey are portrayed closer to characters recovering from loss. They are still affected, but they try to claw their way out of their depression. Basil is a plot device first, an emotional ticking bomb second.. . The plot then shows that Basil, in his - as Cpl. Person of Generation Kill would say - infinite retardation, worsened Mari's demise by >!hanging her corpse.!< Even with the credible justification of him being a >!scared 12 years old with implications of suicidal thoughts,!< that is still fucked up and, for some, the final nail to the Basil-sized coffin destined straight to Hell. For me, it was to me once.. . Hell, I thought back then that Basil basically gets off relatively scot-free while the burden of proof falls on Sunny to explain to the gang that his case was a >!manslaughter, not a murder.!<. . As for your last paragraph, I personally don't hold much of those idea anymore. I still don't like Basil as a plot device, but as a character, I like him. I *once* thought that he should die, now I don't. In my *second playthrough* I wanted him dead, now I don't.
The game does not empathize with others more than Basil, it can be argued that it does actually more of the opposite and shows a lot more empathy towards him than Kel, Aubrey and Hero, who aren't in the state of terror Basil. Saying that the game shows more sympathy for the other friends isn't surface level at all, it's completely wrong and can only be seen so, if you ignore Basil's character or struggles. It's like with Avatar fans saying that Zuko is only a character on a redemption arc, or saying that Joseph Joestar from JoJo is just a goofball. It doesn't make sense. . . Basil's characterization of Headspace is the first we see of him and is the basis of how we perceive him. It's a reflection of Sunny's memory of Basil and how he was and still is. That is why first time players hated Aubrey and were pissed off by her so much, because of this characterization that later isn't contradicted in memory lane. Likewise with Kel, he is portrayed as being reckless and mean is also contradicted by the real life Kel later on and shows us that he is more complex than one might think. Headspace being just a dream is equally reductive and narrow-minded, it is the place where Sunny's perspective of the world is shown and a way for him to cope with what happened and not all it in it is superficial. Headspace makes up for most of the game, and there is a whole route where you spend even more time in it and where we interact with the characters, it is a very crucial place for us the player to understand our characters. Hardly just biases. . . Basil himself is OFTEN shown in the story, in almost every plot-relevant scenes of the game and his presence is always the one that is the most relevant, as he is the closest person other than Sunny to the biggest twist. He himself is more shown than Hero and even Aubrey on the first day outside and afterwards, and you get to see Basil more than enough to really get him and why he is the center of the plot. Remember that we meet Basil after we retrieve the Photo Album and how he reacts to everything and Polly mentioning us how Basil's parents aren't around often? You get more piece of information about him than any other character: . . His parents are often absent, he and his caretaker aren't close due to his shyness, and he is both scared of Sunny and of the prospect to lose him, and you do get the sense that something happened between them (If you interpreted it as threatening, you have no idea what a real threat is, it's a cry for help and the majority understood it). Basil gets more characterization than anyone here, including Kel, who might be your only party member, he himself is not as relevant to the overall story as Basil, since his job is merely pointing you the direction and helping you, but the one who is mostly in focus is Basil himself, you are doing things for him. Aubrey is more of a villain and her motives are not explained by her well at all, only until much later after she wants to redeem herself.  THIS is just the first day. The second day has us overcome a fear for Basil and though brief, his words are some of the most important ones in the story: Sunny, there is no way out of this. The third day doesn't need to be explained, the twist, the fight, the encouraging words, the Memory lane scene, the duet and the ending is enough to show us what Basil really is by this point and I don't need to mention it, it is obvious after all. He is no talking statue, he is an important character who moves the plot and is one of the most important architects of all our struggles and still our closest friend in pain, but due to our inability to face reality, we let him suffer for too long until we see the consequences of our actions. Just because a character isn't playable, they aren't simply dolls or statues. Everyone plays different roles, unless you think all NPC's are trash. . . How much a character is shown also has no bearings on their impact on it, as each character is different and so are their roles. Basil is more of a Damsel in distress-type of character and while they aren't all present (Basil is always present and shown in the story, he is in more cutscenes than anyone other than Sunny, which makes him more unique than characters from the same archetype as Peach or Zelda), they don't have to be, they are the person you care the most for and the search, as well as the reunion with them, is what matters. So even if you are correct that you barely see him, that doesn't erase the moments we see him or the impact he had. This isn't really a good criticism at all, and the summary of the real world segments are just biased points that aren't really that well reflected, as I have pointed out. . . Your entire problem with him can be boiled down to not paying attention to his lines of dialogue and his characterization due to you not really liking the character, which is why you overuse the word "fuck-off" for every time he disappears (which is revolting, and the reasonable part feels like damage control) and have issues with him not moving on, when he 1.DID move in the final cutscene you get for caring about him enough, since he genuinely smiled warmly back at Sunny and shows real happiness after what happened and 2. Ignored, surprisingly, how no one moved on at all throughout the story: Kel feels lonely without his old friends and feels guilty of not having been there for them enough, Aubrey alienated her old friends because she refused to understand what they had to go through, Hero is still sad over what happened with Mari and feels like a failure as he is the oldest and should have known better. Sunny and Basil did not move on, precisely because they played an important role in the incident that haunts them and THAT is something very hard to move on, much harder than anything Kel, Aubrey and Hero had to go through, which completely debases your assumption of these 3 having been better explored or their sorrow being more empathized. You couldn't empathize with Basil's problems and didn't care about him, which isn't a bad thing, but where I draw the line is misinterpreting the story and insulting people with such trauma, because his motives are explained more empathically than Aubrey's who comes across as more of a jerk than Basil.. . At least you admitted that this is merely your biased opinion and not a fact, and that you changed your view of the Bad ending, because Sunny's and Basil's suffering is not something that should be enjoyed unironically
Not gonna lie, i've grown to love every omori character unconditionally by the end of the game. Don't know why everyone would hate basil, he's my favorite plant boy 
\>!"normal 12 year old behavior" I doubt Basil was a normal 12 year old, and it's unfair to expect him to act like one.!<. . also hi milks
I agree with you, he didn't have parents to educate him 
Fair enough
when i was 12 all of my peers had some disturbed minds. but maybe its just because of how we grew up and how i usually surrounded myself with people who, similarly, were mentally ill and puberty wasn't being nice on them we all knew how to tie a noose tbh  we also, i highly doubt that there was ever actually an autopsy done on Mari considering it'd be near impossible to actually hide her true cause of death. if there was any real investigation done, basil and sunny would be locked up immediately. so its a plothole at worst, i highly doubt it was meant to characterize basil as a criminal mastermind. cause ngl his methods are shit.
Sorry to hear that my guy, I hope you and your people are doing fine. . And yeah this whole investigation thing is a "suspension of disbelief" kinda deal, either you believe that the investigators were incompetent af or not even present or Basil actually did know very well what he was doing (it still wouldn't make any sense how would hide the bruises on Mari's body from her fall)
His just a kid, and yes, just like Basil, he was definitely not imagining the consequences. That doesn’t make him not responsible. And I’d like to point out, I’m speaking from trying to get into his mind. It is harsh to call him a murderer as a twelve year old, but that’s what he thinks he is. That is what eats away at him and Basil and needs to be hidden away.
Yep
Oh yeah I know that, I have it myself. I just personally didn’t notice any signs of it in Basil. But of course he’s affected by his parents leaving. . . I believe he definitely has some sort of anxiety, though. The game is great at portraying that imo.
Shows how much interpretations vary from people to people haha
> He just did what he thought would protect his best friend which backfired. . Not only did it backfire, it ended up causing exactly what he so desperately wanted to prevent, while also putting some of the guilt upon him. Seriously, with how badly Basil got screwed, hating him seems almost cruel.
DON'T DISRESPECT MY BOI BAGEL!!!
BAGEL BOI IS BEST BOI (or is he a watermelon, I can't tell)
The Basil hate makes me sad. I really like him because he's a fascinating character to me. Sure he's no saint, but if he only did good things, he'd be boring as hell.
Im an avid basil hater and avid basil lover
Strongest Basil Hater vs Weakest 50/50 enjoyer. . 
half of the omori discord server hates basil, once, they had like 2 rants about how much they hated him in a day
I actually hate fanon basil. . Canon basil is fine
how could you hate basil
How tf do people see Basil as annoying when Kel exists?? /hj. . Seriously though I love Basil so much, it's nice to have a character to relate to <3
everytime I see somone list their reasons for hating Basil I get the feeling that they really were not paying attention to the game whatsoever
I don't trust ppl who don't like Basil tbh [/j but not really]. . And belive it the reason for it has nothing to do with the game or fandom.
I don't hate Basil. I just hate that Basil doesn't love himself. It hurts to see traits that I see in myself in him as well.
How could anyone hate bagel. . 
I like Basil. You might like r/Basilcult
Don’t do my man basil like that, he’s one of my top 3 favourites
Right, but Basil wasn’t thinking clearly at the time.
so wasn't Sunny and he didn't hang her until basil told him
That's because he was an emotional wreck after accidentally killing his sister and probably wouldn't have thought to do anything on his own.
You're missing the point. I'm not saying Basil framing Mari's death as a suicide was the right thing to do, I'm just saying it's at least somewhat understandable that Basil chose to take that course of action given the circumstances, and it seems kind of unfair to hold it against Basil given that he both meant well and was clearly not of sound mind at the time that it happened.
People: omg babies yell and whine crazy shit, but still love them. . Danganronpa fans: OmG mikan and Hiyoko are whiney and are best girls  . . . people with Basil: ***i want to beat the living shit out of him if he doesn't stfu***
Tbf I've seen a lot of danganronpa fans hate on Mikan and/or Hiyoko too
I myself haven't been much of a fan for Hiyoko. But, while I agree on your statement I would see more people who adore the two (I'm the one's who actually likes Mikan) than those who hate on them.
For me the last two are reversed. I think Basil’s a sympathetic and at least somewhat likeable character, But Hiyoko’s vulgar attitude was off-putting to me, and >!Mikan dying at the end of chapter 3 was one of my favorite parts about that chapter.!<
Fr about Hiyoko. She has been so rude and was also off putting for me too 
Yeah, >!Chapter 3 was a nice 2 for one deal in that regard!< 
i fucking love basil
I don't hate basil, he's just an alpha male, lucky enough to have a friend group of sigma males (and one sigma female), he's not a beta male, he's just not a sigma male either
How TF is Basil an alpha male?
I mean…I like Basil :)
Basil
How can you hate Basil?
I wish there would be a bonus dlc to play on basil’s life and what went on in his life so we could form a more rounded opinion rather than assuming most of everything.
How can you hate basil
What?! Bro I f\*\*kin love BAsil because hes that on the outside obnoxiously happy person but while helping everyone else he never has anyone to help him. I like Basil because I can relate and connect to him so much. Everyone left him and yett he continued to care because wanted to hold on to the good times. Wanted people to be happy but was never able to get happiness in return. He did so many things rong, but he had everyone depending on him to bringe them together. To help them- the things he did was the only way he was able to hold on to everyone. I think hes an amazing chairicter Personally  (well that and all the other chairicters cause there all epic)
Skill Issue.
wdum? (btw if its about the speccilg sry I suck I have dyslexia!)
oh no
Id like to know why people hate him? I more so like headspace Basil then real world since yk. I’m pretty sure he’s the one who came up with the idea to hang her. If anyone has their reasons please tell?. (If anyone can tell me how to mark spoilers in a comment pls tell me)
Yeah but again. I feel like he was basically verging turning into a complete psycho if he hadn’t already. I feel like at that point it kinda wasn’t basil anymore.
You hate basil because of a joke. I hate him because he's a little bitch boy who can't swim. We are not the same
I am part of the team that doesn't really like Basil. What he's like in headspace or his relation to >!Mari's staged suicide!< has little to nothing to do with it.. . I genuinely don't like how his personality is, even though it's built well. He comes off as manipulative most of times to me. I don't know, it's a gut feeling. If you asked me a specific event I would pinpoint every segment >!between him and Aubrey. We always see him as the bullied guy to save from the bully but he was the one that scribbled every photo with Mari. Now I don't remember how Aubrey got it, if she stole it or was tossed out, but every single scene is just a big misunderstanding (and whatever Kel does, it doesn't help).!<. . It doesn't end here. >!The scene where Sunny goes away leaving him in his room. Yeah he's spiraling but guilt tripping someone into staying with you? Hell nah. And Sunny rightfully with his character goes away. I don't like clingy people and Basil is a big one.!<. . In the end, I wouldn't probably like someone like Basil irl so I don't like him as a character.
Also basil isn’t manipulative I genuinely hate when people say that
I understand that some ppl find him annoying but thinking he's a psycho is just too much, there's also the fact that for some reason omocat made basil be such a vague character, everyone in the main group has backstory and even if she doesn't tell us everything abt them still we at least get to know something abt these characters, with basil this didn't happen, we know too little abt him and the story is told to us based on sunnys views of the events so there's a big possibility basil is a better person than we know but we just don't get to see that. We only see sunnys side of the story and how he felt guilty, we know the thing also affected basil but we don't get to see what happened to him or how he really felt abt everything that happened and while sunny shutdown himself and became isolated from everyone Basil is the one that needed to deal with the social consequences of >!mari's death, he had to face everyone abandoning him + getting bullied in a daily basis by aubrey and her gang, mf doesn't have present parents, his grandma is dying, the only person he could trust is polly but he seems to have trust issues with adults so ofc he doesn't trust her.!<. . I really think omori needs a dlc focusing on Basil between these 4 years since the incident, bc his character feels kinda wasted, he's so important to the plot yet we know almost nothing abt his life. Also during his >!fight with sunny I got the impression that basil also has some type of headspace so it would be interesting to see how this affected him!<
I don’t hate Basil but I think his character is really shallow.  He’s a soft kid who likes flowers and has attachment issues, and that’s basically his entire character
Then I'm badly written because that's literally me, lmao.
Basil frustrates me, but he's the most visually pleasing.
basil is the 2. worst character in the game change my mind
whats the 1st worst character
shitheart
Yeah basil kinda did SOMETHING I won’t speak of
Idrc i just like basil cuz hes cute
F Bagel
I like Basil. . When he is in blackspace \[watermelon joke here\]
[basil... pretty]()
Basil is my all time favorite character
How can one hate this Poor Bean ? he is so cute ?! Wow heres says basil sucks ?! Unless youre chuck norris i will fight you
wait people don't like basil??? why???? he is so fking adorable?????
I love Basil...on my salat 😎
Basil's a total bro. Helps cover up an accidental murder and never speaks of it no matter what.
It's weird seeing this post cuz my name is actually Basil lol
Basil needs a hug and a lot of therapy
I don't hate Basil I just wanna squish him and chuck him like a stress toy
I like basil I think he's really cool! I just however find what he did sooo unrealistic and dumb. What sunny did just sounds like what anyone would do. Then basil comes and just flips it. Id have liked if somehow it was a bit more realistic. Still nice flower boi tho :)
Basil smells like dirt and manure
I don’t really like Basil
i love basil. his birthday is right next to mine, and his beta name is my name. i love him
not bagel!
I really don't understand the hating basil thing, all of em went through shit and basil's just getting shit on for it while everyone else is just surviving
I dont hate Basil at all. I more feel sad for Basil and Sunny. But its just my feelings to them.
poor basil, he didnt deserve hate...
Basil did little to nothing wrong
basil is hated?
Basil is my favourite . . I don't see why people hate him for having trauma
Basil is precious baby
I love basil because I feel like my personality is some sort of amalgam of basil and kel’s personalities
basil is my boy
Wait, people actually hate basil? I wish we'd gotten to know him a little betterbut for the entire game, I was dead set on saving him because he was far too precious.
Well, Basil’s left hand looks deformed, if that counts for anything.
its the word "OMO"
Pffft- oh my god you’re right-
Basil looks like he has seen some shit.
Man's been in ground zero of a missile detonation.
He has become death, destroyer of worlds…
little does Basil know that this nice, friendly girl will be >!beating his ass on the daily only 4 years later!<
*ouch*
Plot twist >!that's his fetish!<


basil looks like a geicopathway
Awww, Basil is so fucking cute when he makes his *I'm thinking about all the ways I could hide your corpse* face
Basil is like a psycopath with that face
I think you mean psychopath
\*cyclepath
Oh yeah,my mistake 😖
Yea sorry...
Don't apologize
Basil became part of the friend group. . ...but at what cost
I keep forgetting Basil's a boy 😅
Deport basil but gawd this is cute af
man really just said “I deport this character” and got downvoted. 1984
Reality can be cruel.
Deport him???? What do you mean??
Deport him for hate crimes against Bulgarians?
Basil gang will come and beat you up now
You were right about that
Yes
So Basil is straight or gay?
Both I guess
Well, there are some people who swing both ways.
Hmmm, at least its a conclusion
Why must people assume that everything is ship art.
It's a fandom, always are some toxicity. Even in fact that in omori all the characters are beginning puberty, everyone whant a ship in their respective
Same goes for Basil and Ralsei. And I guess OMORI and Kris? Not sure about this last one but maybe.
Bruh I wanted the Basil shirt so bad but it sold out quicker than >!Mari falling down the stairs!<. Damn you Basil simps and damn me for being one of them.
If your not talking about the sweater and the actual shirt basil is wearing in the art, I just bought one 30mins ago so act fast if that’s the case lol
The basil shirt is on preorder iirc so you have until tomorrow night or so to preorder! The sweatshirt is sold out tho
I was gonna preorder the shirt but I decided I'm gonna save some money for the art book! I can't wait-
Yea I hope the art book isn’t too expensive, but I know my ass is gonna buy it regardless LOL. Same thing happened with the CD for me I remember I told myself $30 was the most I’d pay for it but when I saw $40 I still just went for it.
he does, it's just covered by basil. if they had the fight basil would have a scar on his nose i think
i just wish i had money. . and in a way wish there were less basil simps
my mom let me buy the basil shirt amen
>!I assumed he attempted to save Basil but didn't think before acting and so struggled alongside Basil, both of them being saved by Hero.!<
Happy cake day Toothpaste eater Basil flair person
Toothpase
POV: You're Basil in that one blackspace room
POV:”You see Basil simping”
You see the trick is you should raid the house and take Basil too. Then you should feed and water him and soon you will have multiple basils. I do not know why you would want multiple Basils but you would have multiple Basils
Have multiple basils so that u can sell them. Then create a scarcity of Basils by hoarding them and making people think that they are rare. Don't tell people on how u create multiple Basils tho, and if they ever find out, eliminate them. . . After you profit off of Basils, try investing in Aubreys and Kels. . . 📈📈📈
WHY ONLY SELL BASILS?! SELL OIL AS WELL!
Guns! Sell stocks! Sell diamonds! Sell rocks!
Sell water to a fish, Sell the time to a clock

Ah, so that's how Omori populated Black Space.
Yes that is correct however we don’t talk about what he did in black space because he did not properly feed the Basils resulting in what we see in the black space
Ofc you need multiple basils so you can hug and comfort them all
Well, the more the merrier and to also >!cover up more murder!< obviously
i'm raiding basil's house for basil
Now that seems like a good plan for me
It is acceptable
same
Let's do it.
Take Basil.
sell basil's kidney for extra profit
**NO**
this is 6 months old
One does not care for the age of a comment, when it mentions selling Basil's kidneys.
almost another year later and i WILL protect basil’s kidneys
nah, they're mine
Another year later, still here to tell you don’t steal his kidneys
1. Kill BASIL. . 2. Sell his kidneys. . 3. >!Go to BLACK SPACE to find more BASILs!<. . 4. Repeat
Basil is a simp
Welcome to basil space
BASIL HAS THE OMORI PLUSH. CHARGE
I want these plushies.. . And yes, that includes Basil, because he's adorable and has a cute squishy face. All signs point to Basil being a plushie.. . (Wow this is cringey)
Basil... *tell me your location*
Nooo, not Bagel!!!. ... Tho if it's to hug him then okay
We must raid Basil’s house to give him the love and support he needs
Sharing is caring you know, Basil
ayo what the fuck basil
I would sell my left nut for a Basil pillow 🤤
i dont got any but i would sell them either way
sell your kidneys
mmmm kidneys.... they taste good
ran out during the kidney famine last summer
I WOULD SELL BOTH OF THEM.
Shout out to omori and basil for sacrificing themselves as pillows
Actualy the sandwhich is pretty easy, if you know how to make sandwiches you can make one. . Same for Basil's Garden Salad, if you know how to make a salad, gathering up the ingredients and mixing them into a salad shouldn't be difficult either
It’s easy to gather souls?. . . Edit: no wait that was a meme I saw
I mean. . ***It depends how far you're willing to go for a sandwich/salad***
Basil is vegan or it's just a normal salad
He is shown to eat chicken when you have lunch with Polly, I doubt she would have done that if Basil was vegan/vegetarian. I think Hero choose salad because Basil likes plants and it is a plant based food.
Omori: "Fear not, I've come to rescue you!". . Basil: \*swoons\* "Oh Omori, you're my hero!". . Omori: "Um, is your name Zabloing?". . Basil: "No... but I-". . Omori: "Well then I wasn't talking to you was I? Get out of the way!"
>!Basil: Wait! Omori, I have something important to tell you!<. . >!Omori: So you’ve chosen death!<
Omori: by snu snu  . . . (Happy Basil Noises)
BASIL: I bet he's thinking about me again. . OMORI:

Shh no you dont. . Only zabloing

Yeah here is the other one =D . . 
finally, an artwork in which basil actually looks male
Well they your gonna have to deal with basil crying the whole way
The tears just give me more JUICE.

are you like talking about the country Brazil? or the name of basil in your language?
I think they're talking about the country (in Portuguese we say Brasil too)
Oh ok, now I understand :') . . also, I'm from Brazil -w- . . I write this way because of Grammarly
r/suddenlycaralho pelo o que eu posso ver

You dont translate names
Actually, countries do have translations (or even different names) depending on the language. I mean, Germany in english is Germany, but in german it's Deutschland, in portuguese it's Alemanha and so on...
That, yes. Like my name, matias, in english would be matthew. But my name isnt matthew.
All country names are translated in chinese.
Ok... but thats not the point...
I don't get the point then
We are talking about basil in spanish. Not random names in chinese. It is cool to know though
Basil in Brasil huehueheuhue
r/suddenlycaralho
Medo de brasileiros
Bota os mamonas aí do lado kkkkkkkkkk
SHUT THE FUCK UP BASIL. . #  WE MUST KACHOW TO BRAZIL
aw basil it's not a big of a deal if u come to brazil you can visit my house if u wanna, also there so many cool places
Basil is going to San Francisco
basil is mr. death grips?!
Basil is MC Ride
If you put a R between B and A in Basil, you will get the word Brasil, that means Brazil in Portuguese
. . Every basil meme is canon
>!That whole part was all shits and giggles until basil exploded!<
I think he has more to explain to Basil...
Well... In this situation the explanation will be more ducked up. But it would essentialy boiled down to "I needed to kill your dream you to save your real You". Which is creepy but true
Coz' he would not remember the truth if he didn't kill him in a dream and if he hadn't remembered the truth he wouldn't have aweken that night to save Basil from commiting Suicide
Don’t worry dream basil is just sleeping
He ate too much watermelon
dont worry basil, thats just a watermelon that somehow looks a lot like you, and you know what we do to watermelons
"I like ya cut g"
THE BASIL PART IS JUST. OH MY GOD
i headcanon that dream basil and real basil are one and the same since basil was involved in the... thing so both sunny and basil are in the same dream.
he was involved in the pizza delivery
Nah, he helped recycle the pizza boxes afterwards
omori with a dead stare at rw basil
Basil: “Just pose like how I would.”
He's looks cute. . Edit: Give this post a Basil smile award cuz he's really adorable =w=
cute but a bit thick
Thicc

yep, better thanks basil for helping me out
Basil looks... Lost... I feel like it might be a *warning* (i like the art a lot!!)
But what about Basil's flower crown??
I forgot about it T-T

He can't, Basil is already fucked up.
>!The truth photos are a bit weird because it's still Sunny's headspace so it's his perspective framed as basils. So it's what he thinks basil saw/knows about. Although I thought basil knew it was an accident hence why he tried to help cover it up instead of reporting it!<
i just hope asgore don't take basil's soul
More than pray yes
BASIL has acquired: a father figure
Not to be that guy, but Basils parents aren't dead, they're just out of the country a lot.
I wonder what Basil would call it...

Alternatively, "everything's going to be okay"
Alternatively, >!something!<

Basil was trying to record for "sentimental" purposes
is that a reference, i swear i heard that somewhere
: it was a very important moment in your lives, and I wanted you to remeber it!. . : couldn't you have taken the photo after we finished, instead of in the middle of it?
Basil's last words were "Harder, mommy"
 Thank Lord a hurricane gonna. Kill me cause I am traumatized

R63 basil be like
No that’s a type of girl that acts like a boy, I think the word your looking for is femboy
Based
Like everyone in the  comments is talking about how basil isn’t a girl
Basil is a boy, a femboy (he is literally me guys) but still a boy
Omori fans really out here calling 12 year olds femboys 
the word femboy isn’t sexual, it literally just means “feminine boy.” I considered myself (not completely to the same extent as now) when I was 12. The Internet fucked up the term now it’s silly
Femboy is a heavily sexualized term and has sexual implications, now more than ever. . . But even besides that, he's 12. Mf hasn't even gone through puberty yet and ain't even feminine 💀
Femboy never meant anything sexual. . It's literally a feminine boy. . Fem(inine)boy
Words change, it is a heavily sexualized term now more than ever. There's no point in denying it lmao. . But even then, calling a 12 year old a femboy is pretty weird. . (OMORI fans when you tell them calling a child a sexualized word is wrong )
I will deny it, because it's simply not true. . Maybe the word is sexualized, but that doesn't mean you can't use it without the sexual implications. . And Basil *is* a femboy. He acts like a femboy, dresses like a femboy and even talks like one. There is no way you haven't noticed that.
You on some hard-core copium then. Even the original comment I was replying to admitted it is becoming a sexualized term.. . . "an adolescent male whose appearance and behavioural traits are regarded as conventionally feminine". . . He's 12. Mf hasn't even been through puberty, he is not an adolescent. He is not a femboy. He doesn't act like one, nor dress like one or talk like one. Idk what dialogue you made up in your head, but it isn't canon.. . . If you can give some examples, go right ahead
hes 16 lol
Okay? 16 year olds are still children, idk what you're getting at. . . And not to mention, the image of him used here is from when he was 12.
A lot of 12 year olds are already adolescents though? I started puberty when I was like 11 lol.
Okay? That doesn't suddenly justify it. Don't use sexualized language on a child, I shouldn't need to elaborate, and it's weird people are so upset about it
"Daddy" is also a sexualized word nowadays, does that mean girls shouldn't use the word on their own fathers after reaching a certain age just because some people think it sounds dirty?
No? Bro what, if you see a little girl calling her father daddy and your brain automatically thinks of it as something sexual, that's your issue.. . . . The difference is femboy is almost exclusively used in a sexual manner. "Daddy", is not.
But someone calling a 12 year old femboy and your brain automatically thinking it's sexual (even after they've clarified it's not) isn't an issue?
We've been through this. It is a highly sexualized word, and is almost exclusively used in a sexual manner. Of course it's going to be interpreted that way (especially when he doesn't even LOOK like a femboy in the safe for work sense). Even the original commenter I replied to admitted it is a highly sexualized word
So is the word "daddy", it is a highly sexualised word and is almost exclusively used for sexual manners. . >he doesn't even LOOK like a femboy. . Litteraly half of the comments here are saying that they thought Basil was a girl at first. He looks feminine, i'm not sure why you're denying that
Except Daddy is not exclusively used as a sexual word. For the most part, it is completely innocent and is not mostly used as a sexualized word. Idk where you even got that from, but it is clearly not. Are you claiming all kids who call their fathers "Daddy" are saying it with sexual intentions? Because wtf. . . And no, he is not feminine. If you can point out his feminine characteristics physically speaking, go ahead
>Except Daddy is not exclusively used as a sexual word.. . Neither is femboy.. . I've never seen anyone use "daddy" in a non-sexual context. . >it is completely innocent and is not mostly used as a sexualized word.. . Do you live in a cave or are you just in denial. . >Are you claiming all kids who call their fathers "Daddy" are saying it with sexual intentions? Because wtf. . How can you not see the hypocrisy is what you're saying? Like seriously what even is this. . Are you claiming all kids who call themselves "femboys" are saying it with sexual intentions? Because wtf. . >And no, he is not feminine. If you can point out his feminine characteristics physically speaking, go ahead. . Ig flower crowns are the peak of masculinity now. You're just arguing in bad faith at this point,
Are 12 years old not boys...? Are they genderless until they hit 18 or smt

Femboy - a boy who is feminine. . I'm not sure where you got "adolescent male" definition fr but either way 12 years are boys (and also adolescent)
Have you ever heard of Google. . . Crazy, I know
You don't need google to know the definition of a "feminine boy". . Also Google doesn't show you a single search, especially for a slang word
Urban dictionary gives the same thing but aight, keep coping homie
I have literally never heard femboy used in a sexual context.
If you go on Google images most results have sexual implications . . . And do I even have to bring up the whole "femboy hooters" trend
Google the word "female nurse", "school girl" or "daddy" etc and 99% of the result will be sexualised. . We're on the internet, everything will get sexualised
Except those words are not exclusively used sexually. They are commonly sexualized in a roleplay sense, but everyday they are fine and completely innocent. A majority of people who use these words use them in a completely innocent context.
>Except those words are not exclusively used sexually.. . Neither is femboy. . >but everyday they are fine and completely innocent. A majority of people who use these words use them in a completely innocent context.. . This is a troll because the cognitive dissonance is just too much here
Femboy almost is exclusively used in a sexual context. Get off the copium dude. . . Blocked so I'll reply here:. . . I think that just says a lot about the term in general. Most people will tell you that it has sexual implications and is mostly used in a sexual context. The femboy subreddit is proof of this. Searching femboy on Google images is proof of this. Searching femboy on Twitter is proof of this. It is almost all suggestive or sexual results. Of course the average person is going to get the impression it's not a safe topic.
The fact that most of the times youve seen the word "femboy" has been in a sexual context says a lot about you. Yikes.
I think basil is just kind and soft spoken and somehow people agree that those character traits can only be of a girl, which is stupid.
He has a stereotypically feminine personality which isnt deniable
And fuck stereotypes?
Sad to see so many people denying it too when it's literally plain as day. Mfs will do anything just to call a child by a heavily sexualized term, then act offended when you tell them it's wrong 💀. . . Basil for real has no feminine traits, idk how people would see him like that in the first place. Sort of just enforces harmful stereotypes, especially when it comes to hobbies and like you said, personalities
Wait, you can't address your father? (Daddy is now a sexual term by your logic)
its sexualized in some areas but not all ( A reason why r/196 is silly cringe) me and most other people who consider themselves one really hate the sexualization and are just normal people. It was only sexualized by weirdos which I believe is best to try and push back on it. and I considered myself feminine when I was 12 (not to the same extent as now of course) and maybe my school was weird most other kids did as well. at least in semi-urban Eastern Ireland being a “Femboy” is a completely normalized and not sexualized term.. . Also sorry for bad grammar or things not sounding like i had to say it i’m ill and feel like i’m dying
Words change their meaning, and this is one of those cases. It's a heavily sexualized word, but even if it wasn't it's still weird to call a 12 year old a femboy. Especially when said kid doesn't even appear feminine?
1. “Femboy” has not completely changed it’s meaning, in a lot of spaces it is not sexualized at all in some places I could say it and everybody would sexualize and others would treat me normally, most places have treated me normally. . . 2. Basil is a fictional character and could not say wether they do or don’t call themselves feminine or not so their opinion is out of the question. . 3. No idea if this is an Ireland or just my school thing or not but femboy is a term used by a lot of the boys in my grade from then till now (Something to note is that me and the rest of them started going through puberty super duper early at like 10 for genetic reasons or something)

Sure, I don't doubt that. But like I said, it absolutely is *heavily* sexualized now. And I don't think it's going to stop going down that path anytime soon unfortunately, so you have to be especially careful when calling minors of all things femboys (something you probably shouldn't be doing in the first place)
I am a Minor, It’s weird calling a 12 year old a femboy if i was 36 I agree on that
Okay? If you're in your teens that's still not an excuse 💀
Usually nowadays the term Femboy is a wa to insult others to tell them they're are outright sexualised. . I'm no expert I just decided to join in
that was in the 90’s, nowadays its more to describe yourself
I don't think people are outright "femboyed".. I see it as a way to describe yourself to a degree, I think it just as a petty insult of how people CAN act
In that case no one under 18 should wear joggers or skirts
Where did you come up with that conclusion
With how people sexualise them, I mean have you never watched anime?
Okay? Idk what that has to do with anything 💀
“It's a heavily sexualized word”. . I’m not gonna disagree that lots of people sexualise it, but we also sexualise other stuff all the time like bathing suits, short skirts, ect, that kids wear, and we do that because the *thing* isn’t inherently/objectively sexual, in the same way how femboys and people who call themselves it don’t do it out of a sexual reason, just because others sexualise it’s doesn’t mean it’s sexual for everyone else
But a majority of people do not sexualize this clothing. You don't look at said clothes, and see it as sexual (if you do, that's your problem). They are intended to be sexual (unless the intent is there, through body language, combination of clothing, etc).. . . But a majority of people DO sexualize femboys to the point that it is a sexual topic. It has heavy sexual implications, and there is no point in denying it. The femboy subreddit and Google images are proof alone. Almost every post is sexual or suggestive.. . . When words like this become so heavily sexualized and have these implications, it's your responsibility to not associate it with children.
Would you say the same with how sexualised lesbians are?
Wdym? Idk if you realize this but sexualities are not the same as kinks
True there's no indication of him being a femboy or having sexual interactions with anyone.. . This sub continues to amaze me with the "Basil cringe hate"
Omori fans on their way to reinforce harmful stereotypes (only women can like flowers and gardening)
I have you know I actually have a certain favour of flowers, I don't do gardening but I have my picks.. . If only Omori fans were a bit more open minded 
He is kinda. Basil has a stereotypically feminine personality, Aubrey has a stereotypically masculine personality, it's mostly unrelated to their appearance
I'm not saying he doesn't have it physically but the way I see it, it's just the fandom making him seem that way
Alrightey lemme just skip past this thread
🗿🤝🗿
12 year old girls can be tomboys. The opposite of tomboy is femboy. Ergo, it stands to reason that 12 year old boys can be femboys.. . Of course, transphobes see anything that violates cis-normativity as sexual degeneracy...
Tomboy and femboy are used very differently. One is much more sexualized than the other. Look at tomboy on Google images compared to femboy and tell me they're similar, because they really aren't . . . Imagine calling someone a transphobe for disliking people sexualizing a child
Gross fetishist do not and cannot define a term real people rightly use for themselves
Unfortunately a majority of people use the word with sexual intentions in mind. Like I said, it may not have started that way but words change. It is overall a heavily sexualized word, and is now seen as that. Especially with how Google images portrays it.. . . With how it is now, people have to have responsibility with said word and not call minors by it (they really shouldn't be in the first place)
They really don't. Trans fetishists and transphobes are often the same people. The same concept applies to femboys. I am not responsible for policing language to accommodate the people who make the dehumanizing pornography on your safe search off results.
he's 16 in faraway isn't he, and he's still a femboy there
Exactly!! The way he dresses and has his hair and all basically didn't change lol
And still a minor. Doesn't make it any less weird. Also doesn't have any feminine characteristics anyways
> doesn't have any feminine characteristics . . bruh moment . . you're looking at the same basil as us, right?
Where are the feminine characteristics bro, I don't see them
you're literally writing this on a post that confused him for a girl.
I think you missed the joke of the entire post my guy. Refusing to answer the question doesn't help your case
1. Flower crown. This is the biggest reason.. 2. He’s the least combat-oriented character, and most of his specials are based around healing and flowers.. 3. He’s the shyest, least confrontational and most passive character, and is basically a damsel in distress for most of it.. 4. His gardening hobby and, to a lesser extent, photography.. . Obviously none of these traits are exclusive or essential to women or girls, but they do tend to be more commonly associated with women, girls, and female characters, and are more feminine than more opposite traits.. In conclusion, Basil is a feminine boy.
What's wrong with that?? Femboy means feminine boy... Why shouldn't a 12 y/o be allowed to use it? It's only sexual if you make it.... But it's really not by default.
Because the word has very heavy sexual implications, and is almost exclusively used sexually.. A 12 year old shouldn't be labeled as such in the first place, sexual or not.. . . Not to mention Basil isn't even feminine lmao
It's not used almost exclusively sexually... Have you ever even talked to femboys??? I'm one of them by the way... It's just some internet weirdos making the word sexual. It just means feminine boy. Basil isn't exclusive feminine, but that doesn't mean that no 12 y/o can call themselves femboy... It's. Not. Sexual. Unless. You. Make. It.
It very much so is. The femboy subreddit is mostly suggestive or sexual content (despite being labeled as a non sexual sub?), most or all results on Google images are suggestive or sexual, etc. It's definitely mostly used in a sexual context, there's no point in denying it.
That is, again, only if you make it that. There's a lot of femboys (like me, god damn it) who don't see it as anything sexual. It is often sexualised. But IT IS NOT BY DEFAULT. You're literally not making any sense. There's also suggestive stuff on nonbinary and trans subs. We're also sexualised A FUCKING LOT. That doesn't mean a 12 y/o can't be trans or that being trans is automatically something sexual. Despite it often being seen that way. Femboy can be something sexual, so can anything else. It doesn't have to be, and the definition of it definitely isn't. So don't make it something it's not, jeez Luise.
But a majority of people do see it as sexual, that's just a fact. You tell someone about femboys, and they decide to Google it? Yeah, they're going to assume it's a sexual thing. I get to some people it may be completely innocent, and it may have started that way, but things change and this is one of those unfortunate cases. A distinction between the people who sexualize it and the people who keep it innocent should be made because of this.. . . It's sexualized by a majority of people, and that's the unfortunate truth. So it's people's responsibility to not call minors by said word because of the implications . . . LGBT subs are no where near as sexualized as the femboy sub is. I can tell you that right now. Of course people sexualize it, but it isn't the majority.
A majority of people see me being trans as something sexual. The majority is not always right. And if they're even remotely smart, they're gonna read the definition and know it's nothing sexual. It is, of course, not right to sexualise femboys. But it's also not right to not allow kids to call themselves a word that's not supposed to be sexual, just because grown up weirdos are trying to ruin it.
I get there are weirdos out there, and a lot of them too, but I'd say LGBT acceptance is pretty majorly accepted atm. I can't say for certain if transphobes are in the majority or minority, but I can say for certain most people see femboys as a sexual term.. . . The majority may not always be right, but when a majority of people portray femboys as something sexual? Then yes, it is turning into a sexual term. A distinction between people who keep it innocent and those who do not should be made
Femboy is the equivalent of tomboy, unless you wanna start using calicogirl
But one term is far more sexualized than the other. Compare the results of tomboy with femboy on Google images. One is clearly far more sexualized
You can still use it innocently
Sure, but for the most part it is a sexual term. That is almost exclusively how it is used, so people should have the responsibility to not use that word towards minors. Even if it was completely innocent, it would still be weird to call a child a femboy
What should be used instead?
I think an easy fix would be to start using "feminine boy" instead of shortening it. Doesn't roll off the tongue as well, but better than the alternative.
if you're literally basil, cosplay him then
cursed with brown hair
get a wig then.. . (I too have brown hair and am working on a basil cosplay)
Ordered, now i just need the outfit lol
good boy
Jokes on you, I walk with open feet so that I can skate!
It is a comic involving Basil and Chihiro. My lawyers advise me to say no more than that.
Sause?
I'll PM you
nah now i'm curious
Into your PMs I go...
tbh i'm curious now too...

....................can i have a pm too
You asked for it
Can I get the link too?
oh man
i want to know but at the same time something tells me that i don't 
Stay innocent. I don't know what comic they mean, but.. it can't be any good, trust me
Uhh please sauce
Thought I was done with this :')
Never, you have unleashed an endless curse
on my first playthrough i thought basil was a girl so, i understand all of the meme on him
Undefined temperature take: Basil gets babied by OMORI's (and the fandom's) visual storytelling and it's part of the reason why some people hate him.
Elaborate?
the biggest plot twist in omori is learning basil is a boy
Basil is a boy LMAO
bruh basil is a guy
wait but basils a guy
basil is a boy
Basil's a dude 
TRANS BASIL. . BOTTOM TEXT
Why
try not to post about basil for 1 sec in r/OMORI 100% fail percentage
**speaks in a new Yorker accent** HOLD IT! SOMETHING'S WRONG! BASIL IS A GIRL!? I thought he is boy!
Yeah cool but no because basil is a boy not a girl and if you don’t believe me do some online and in game research.
basil's a male
basil is a boy
why did you put basil ss girl. he a fucking boy
Are we just not going to talk about how they called BASIL a girl
Basil is not a girl BASIL IS NOT A GIRL **BASIL IS NOT A GIRL**
🏩: i was gonna say basil isn’t a girl but ended up saying “ralsai isn’t a girl” out loud 😵‍💫
You’d be right either way lmao
Still accurate
Basil femboy. . Basil femboy
basil is trans confirmed????
With the was this comment section (and post) looks, ima just go out and say CALL PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANNA BE CALLED. Neither the game nor basil used the term "femboy" ONCE so it's safe to assume basil doesn't wanna be called that so don't. Also,neither the game nor basil called basil a girl, so it's safe to asuume HE DOESN'T WANNA BE CALLED THAT.
Omori fans when someone goes against the perceived wishes of a fictional character:
To be fair to the people calling him a femboy, Basil doesn't appear in the game very often, the only characters that refer to Basil at all are either people who know him well or people who are connected to someone who knows him well.
Basil is boy.
basil is a trans girl (canon)
im sorry but basil is a boy. like all the other kids address him as "he"
BASIL IS NOT A GIRL-
Basil is a boy, right?
Basil is a boy though 
: "Hello. My pronouns are he/him. Please respect them.". . Btw. misgendering a cis person is not better than misgendering a trans person. The Omori wiki states that Basil is male and uses the pronouns he/him.
basil FtM (real!!)
Did you just misgender >!Basil!<?
But isn’t basil a boy?

>>! Now, don't use that shitty argument against me ever again, or else you'll end up like your sister.!<. . HOLY SHIT DUDE 🤣🤣🤣
: Basil? What did that mean?. . : It means your opponent fought hard, but you are taking the high road and leaving. . : Release my brother. . : You monster. . : Don't listen to him, Sunny!. . : Basil STOP
I can't understand what they are saying, can you translate it in twitter terms?. . ....i think i may have gone too far...
This should be canon since this is the same Basil who suggested the >!"Stage a suicide to get away with your sister's murder"!< plan
Mark as spoiler 
Sorry, my bad! 
Basil moment. 
: Basil, this is Tetris.
: help I'm going bIind

OMFG . Basil is about to get blasted
so cute :DD (rip basil X))
Basil rolled a bat 20 on his deception check
DM: Okay and she rolls a... Nat 1. She is dead. . . Sunny: Fuck. Fuck. Shit man what do we do? . . Basil: Wait, I got an idea. We stage it like a suicide. No one knows it was us. . . Sunny: What about our prints? . . Basil: Do you have a better idea? . . Sunny: ...No. . . Basil: Okay, so we hang her corpse in the backyard. . . DM: *rubs face with their hands* Okay gimme a... performance check? . . Basil: Nat 20. . . DM: Literally no one knows it was you.
DM: Wis check!. . Sunny and Basil: nat 1. . Dm: have fun with trauma
That’d be a saving throw but yes
if only they had the lucky feat
I’m glad I discovered this 2 years later cause this is some dnd shit that my players would do.
Basil: I would like to >!admit what happened.!<. . DM: Roll a wisdom check.. . Basil: Nat 1.. . DM: You >!stage it as a sewer side. You have the prone effect until you admit it.!<
A sewer Side? Did they flush her down the toilet
omori Toilet au
Dude, even through shes dead, her furnal would be disgusting in an sewer, how do you even get the body there without loseing it?

. . This is how you actually handle a basil plush
ON G A W
You mean… that I must handle His feet 'n head like he was a gun? 
Good guess but no  . . . Tear it's arms and legs off  . . . find some way to put those said arms and legs into bullets  . . . shoot the remains of the plush
Idk, wouldn't Basil ammo heal instead of hurt? 
idk man  . . . fabric is as good of a projectile as any
Welp, seems you Just learnt a new fanskill: seed bullet. Deals damage based on Speed instead of attack.
oh nahh  . . . DO NOT GIVE YOUR M16 COFFEE  . . . WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE
* water Wars  \*
Yumm watermelon 
Red hands demonstrate. . Every Basil plush is lovely. . How do you handle Etsy Basil? . . 
What is gamage?
Damage
Just hug him, with your hands, and put him on your lap. I've heard Bagels are very cuddly secretly, but hold back from externalizing their cuddle urge 
I think "they" hold back from doing most things, until they trust you.
Could ya grab him by his body then? If I may be curious
. . Hold him like this
He already has brain gamage
Brown goulash
. . If you hold him from the head he'll come out as Xboxlivesexual
. . Me:
THE ART IS SO CUTE I WANT THAT PLUSHIE SO BAD
Why do I want to kill basil plush in the most painful way possible
Idk, U R supposed tk
Alternatively, you can hold him like a small child
awwww
this is the way 
Aww, da Bagel plush is so adorable 

He never climbed on so I threw him away
But how did you throw him?
I grabbed his head squeezed it then threw as hard as I can
blease treat him wit a love and a respetc 
Throw him at the wall
But first you must hold him XD
Give him brain damage 

it worked basil plush is now my friend



oops made a typo in title. art by @yuiluqqq on instagram and twitter
It may take a few years.. but he’ll climb on… eventually
JAR JAR JAR

he will get brain gamage 
Babil!! :3
Fellow pebble thrower, I almost confused you for someone else . . I’m sorry u/1337futaba
Same thought hahahaha, now you know the feeling!
Hii profile pic twin, it must be fate that we meet, thanks to my main page as well 🤝
Damn never thought of that
Time to hand the plushie with a scalpel 
The babil: 
omg too cute!
I did this and he never climbed... My babil plush hates me...

I wish the plush looked more like this. . (If you say there’s no difference trust me, there is, I’m an artiste✨)
Look at my post history
YOURE KILLING HIM
check out mine >:3

If I boop its nose, will that give it a concussion?
I like how he is treated like a sentient object.. . Pretty adorable.. . *^(And... wow, this already is one of those "Top 500" posts, isn't it? Heh, just when i thought there was no chance of that happening any-time-soon.)*  . *^(Fitting for an especially good post/meme, but breaking 3k upvotes is a feat mixed with massive luck and ""quality"".

Kill



i just stab him with a knife until it holds onto it so i can carry it around
The red hands are not done with the Bagel
Thanks this really helped
As a Basil i can confirm this is how you do it
im a basil too 
hello fellow basil
DO - Use the 9 Iron
oh my goodness that is literally so adorable :sob:
Destroy the Basil
its so weird knowing the original meme is from my current favourite fandom and i'm seeing it with my previous...
instructions unclear my basil plush no clipped out of reality and out of the backrooms he is floating in the black void until he finds god and becomes one himself he wants revenge help
What if i grab him from the legs?
... thats a child
what did he say?
"What do you call someone under the age of 18?"
minor? im scared. 
What the hell happened here
can i pick him up and put him on my hand
this is just like how you'd do with a gekko lol
What does he use his antenna for is he spying for the watermelons


Soak him will and throw him against a wall
Elevator
Even in the art basil plushy looks traumatize
I didn't even think it was possible for Basil to get more brain damage...
I WANT IT SO FUCKING BAD BUT IT'S NEVER IN STOCK WHEN I HAVE MONEY FUCKING HELP MEEEE
Basil: \*calm voice\* "Oh look, it's those kids that make fun of Sunny. Let's go say hi...". . Hero: "Basil, why would you- **WTF ARE YOU DOING!? GET OFF THE SIDEWALK!!!**". . Basil: \*still horrifyingly calm\* "Oh, am I on the sidewalk? Oopsie doopsie ☺️" \*floors it\*
I feel like this is very much on brand for Basil
I've always loved the "innocent and naive facade hiding a complete psychopath that would kill for Sunny" energy that Basil has
All that he needs is a rope and a target
agent 47 better watch out
Ok. Someone NEED to make a mod out of this.
I mean hey, he did know about suicide and people hanging themselves at the age of twelve. The thing is, this is the 90s and there was no internet so Basil wouldn't even be able to look things like that up. And I doubt Polly would let him watch things like that on the news, so how would Basil know things like hanging yourself or framing murder as suicide? I don't need sleep, I need answers!
There was internet in the 90s. Hell the internet has technically been around since the mid 80s or even the 70s by some definitions, though science basil isn't part of the DIA (*we think*) the latter is kinda a moot point.
Well, there was no DEVELOPED internet is what I should say, not by today or even the 2006 standards.
There were still search engines and websites and the like, especially during the later 90s.
That’s just a yandere.
I'm pretty sure it's more a case of general extreme instability than it is omori spesifically.
he doesn't need a driver's license, he's played gta
Bas(il)ed and basilpilled
Proof that Basil is a murderer
this line also works for >!Basil!<
~~I always knew Basil had an inner yandere~~
~~No❤~~
search your feelings, you know it to be true.
As Basil’s instincts tell him to get the garden shears and rope ready.
lol I just noticed that Basil is sad and angry at the same time in the last pic
Don't be sad. Here's a [hug!]()
That's a lotta hugs.

Murder Basil was so cute.
Aubrey being a bean as usual, adorable. Seems this time she's being so bean-like even Omori can't resist her anymore.. . Oh, Kel, what's gonna happen this time?. . Oop. Kel, you dummy. So clumsy.. . Damn, even Basil's pissed. Leave it to Kel to find a way to make peaceful lil' Basil want to commit murder.. . And of course, Mari looking for Hero's love as usual.. . Adorable comic.. . Hmm, seeing Basil resort to violence makes me wish we could see Headspace Basil actually fight in the game.. . I mean, with how crazy he is about gardening, I could totally see him having some awesome ecokinesis abilities... although I can't really think of anything specific.. . I'm curious if anyone has any ideas for cool abilities he could have? Cause I do think it'd be awesome.
THE TEARFUL ANGER BASIL IS GOING THROUGH, THE MANS INVENTED A WHOLE NEw EMOTION IN THE DREAM WORLD.
Omori has 2 hands and shoulders Basil
I love basils mixed emotions
Triggered two groups of people.. . Basil's "unsane" status is kind of fitting.
What the hell you predicted omori's and basil's release energy animation in the switch version
If these ever get mixed, the ship wars will stop for five minutes and even the Basil haters and the Basil lovers will band together to murder whatever sick fucks that decided mixing the ship piles was a good idea
As a basil lover I confirm I will be willing to band with the haters for this cause
As a Basil hater but also appreciator (I don’t like him but I can see the appeal) I am willing to band together with the Basil lovers to kill the pile mixers
Contract signed
: SHUT THE FUCK UP OR I’M GETTING THE LUBE, BASIL!

It's been 6 hours, Basil. Where are the news
⠀
It's been 6 months, Basil. Where is real OMORI
Cmon basil we are waiting
and then basil is GeorgeNotFound and that's when the psychological horror part of the game REALLY comes out.
he looks emotional, which is probably the point-. most people aren't cute when they're screaming and crying </3
true. people talk about ugly criers as if we're supposed to look cute while tweaking the fuck out
Basil: "HOW COULD YOU DO THAT!?!". . Basil: "THAT'S MEAN SUNNY! THAT'S SO MEAN!!". . Sunny: "I just don't get what's so funny about a fat bugs bunny"
I'd give this an award if I had one
Yeah and besides he still looks extremely cute for someone screaming and crying
Basil looks like he's about to lose it.
When is he not about to lose it?
Good question.
pretty sure he had already lost it by that point
Fair point there.
man's about to go sicko mode
Lmao, yea.
Looks like they are both having their worst mental breakdown yet
why would it be? she’s a good artist
in general? meh, closer to cute. . in this picture? homeboy is having a meltdown, neither lmao
Cute, but very concerning
it seems that both are about to commit cooperative suicide, and are about to lose all their sanity
Although I had been earnestly daydreaming until then, I suddenly started to laugh. “I see two lovers looking over the edge of the cauldron of hell. Are they contemplating a double suicide? This means their love will end in hell.” I couldn’t stop laughing.
that was oddly specific
Where is this quote from?
Kitchen
Phew, thought it was the graveyard guy
Banana Yoshimoto. Loved that book. . It brings me so many memories.
Haha yeah I never actually read it
He looks distressed, to be honest not the cutest facial trait in my book
He looks like he's having a mental breakdown lol
lmao!!1
i don't think how attractive someone is is the focus when they're having a mental breakdown
Looks puncheable
Flair checks out
Submissive and beatable
god damn y'all lmao poor guy
Looks very breedable rn

adorable is my go-to word for basil so i say adorable
He looks so distraught
I don’t think ugly or cute is the question, really. He does look super emotional, which I feel is the point.
i just feel bad for basil... the dilemma he's facing
This is how ppl look In reality when having a break down
like anime characters?
No gross sobbing
He is very cute but "something behind you"
Wonder what she meant by certain cutscene. I got some pointers but no clue otherwise.
>!probably the “something behind you” part!<
Is anyone gonna mention the fact this was for a cutscene? Imagine that damn cutscene in-game dude...
This coulda been a cutscene already in game too. I honestly was thinking that this was the >!Fight scene towards the end!<
Precisely, but it's a cutscene man! Cutscenes are epic!
basil always looks precious <3
Basil: >!*is having a mental breakdown, a psychotic episode, and is about to kill himself*!<. . . Fandom: Basil looks kinda ugly in this drawing, ngl
why is cute one of the first things that came to your mind when he is screaming crying i get the whole ship thing but man just man
Cute he’s always cute
it Looks so ugly for me
I dont think thats the right question here…
Punchable
poor bagel :(
Fuck bagel
Makes a comment with an unpopular opinion on a fictional character to see what happens/ how toxic the fandom is . . Gets downvoted. . Guess I’ll unsub??
Daaamn, you’re really gonna unsub over 3 downvotes? If that’s the case I don’t think you’re ready for Reddit in general-
It was a joke, it was mean to sort of mock r/justunsubbed because people post there after getting downvoted.
Omg kawaii mental breakdown!!!!~~~
Basil looks lowkey horny
He lookes better than most people do when crying
He looks like he’s about to have a mental breakdown.
Love the expressions. Congrats!
Yes
They both looking too cute
r/yandere
I mean, he's ugly crying in that photo so...
i love that face
It looks like the raw expression of a broken man
His expressions match the dialogue so well; it brings out the fear and the anger perfectly. My conclusion: basil is perfec
Basil at his most mentally healthy.
Concerning, it looks concerning
Saw this image but someome drew over it adding hands and such and sunny was like "basil i cant believe youre a certified furry tm" and basil said "sunny i can explain!!". . I would love to see more memes of theses imqges its incredible
Basil is at his most adorable while suffering =o)
Basil looks… well… you know…
Cute
zzzzzugly
Weirdly horny
Absolutely disgusting
Is BASIL a... girl?
Nah,He's a Boy
I see... I forgot the fact that anime's boys look like girls.
Basil doesn’t look ugly or cute there, but Sunny looks so ugly and punchable. . Y’all rlly cant handle opinions 💀
No.
Boy stfu
Ok
Someone’s mad 💀💀💀
# >:[
You have 08 in your name, I win by order of "stfu kid"
he is always ugly
He's always ugly 🤮
Ugly I will punt Basil into the Sun
Basil looks like he is a yandere  (I don’t know why)
He looks lewd. . Just replace the black with red and you get those faces
menacing
Scary
My boy cute
He looks desperate…
scary
Basil more like sus
😈😈😈
21 billion retweets
Scary
Neither - They both look drunk as shit if I‘m being honest with you
neither of those. he looks like he's going to accidentally choke someone to death
ugly
Im gonna guess its the scene >!before the fight!<
He seems nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready.
Basil looks cute and he also looks like he's very embarrassed bc he's trying to confess to Sunny or something without context
None. It looks desperate, as it's probably meant to be
He looks horny if you ask me... which is a bit disturbing
Cute Boi!
Horni
its basil , his face is always ugly #pissbabybasil /hj
I think it's cute, but... heh
Terrified, maybe aroused??
basil isn't ugly he's just annoying
Cute yandere nasıl 🔪🔪🔪 ❤❤❤
He always looks cute unarguably but one look and you can feel the shakiness, he looks hella nervous imo
Damn. I think he looks cute 😓
Basil is always cute.. . Except when he stabs you with garden shears... ***somehow.***. . Yeah, I really never understood how noodle arms femboy suddenly became able to gore a motherfucker with something that's pretty fuckin blunt.
I don't get what's the point of this question...
Anxious
He looks drunk.
Basil looks like he ran out of tears.
A little sus if u ask me
Cutgly.
It doesn't look "ugly", but it might lean in on the cute side, unintentionally. The word "emotional" also fits for Basil, not that much for the emptiness that is Sunny though.. . Anyways, their expressions are pretty nicely done.
3rd. Gay
Flirting or sexual harrasment?
hes delusional and having a mental breakdown i think hes cute in general but otherwise...its not meant to be cute LOL
What cutscene is this supposed to be?. . Also I noticed it says jam instead of jan
nah that's if Basil was a fish
basil is a watermelon
Basil: what happened in 1997?
DON'T TRUST WHAT YOU SEE ON THE TV [Little Sponge] THAT [#@%&]ER IS A [Smooth Criminal] I TELL YOU!!
Don't trust him. . Don't.... . .... . .... . .... . ...mike...
.... . HAVE [Excess Vacation Days]?. TAKE A VACATION [Straight To Hell]!!!
Hey [flower boy] how's it [hanging]?

Reminds me, when I was getting reference, Bridget is actually shorter than even Basil lower end estimate, Bridget is 158 cm but Basil is definitely 160cm+ in all estimate I’ve seen lol.. . It’s just the game art style (especially fighting game) is different so Bridget have far taller proportion in their style while omori is more cartoonish smaller proportion
Bagels and Brisket. . Delicious
Goes good with some pizza 
Basil gives off so much masc-alligned enby energy
Doesn't even give me masc energy tbh
fr? maybe im a bit biased but i like to headcanon him as a demiboy lmao
Idk, too many flowers. . Anyways I'm agender so sometimes I get gendered stuff wrong lmao
fair
Brisket and Basil my beloveds<3
why was basil trending
Probably because of the best Omori character polls
basil is ALWAYS trending
I know nothing about Bridget, but I love how Basil is having a very normal reaction to Spamton while Bridget's just pinching his cheek like he's a cute lil plush doll.
Looks like basil is gay for Bridget 
That would be straight. Because Bridget is a girl.
Depends on who you’re asking
No it doesn't.
Well If you ask ME personally, he’s a boy
Well, she isn't a boy. She's literally confirmed to be a girl by the developers.
Well It’s just my head canon then 
Now Basil can be a \[\[BIG SHOT\]\]!
I can’t wait to send this to my brother, who loves bridget and basil but hates spamton
your argument is valid, I’ll admit. I mean, books like Thirteen Reasons Why, All the Bright Places, Looking for Alaska, It’s Kind of a Funny Story, and The Perks of Being a Wallflower discuss mental illness and target YA audiences, which I think is great seeing how important it is. I just think 13, at least for a typical kid, is probably two or three years early.. . maybe I’m just sensitive, but seeing >!Basil’s fate!< in the Neutral endings was tough even at 22
I really gotta stop clicking those spoiler things b4 finishing the game
They are like a bubble wrap, you have to tap them. . >!Pop!!<
Actually >!his fate!< Was something that 8 year old me had to deal with in first person, so if it were for me personally i would rate this game even lower lol
basil smoothie 
Wouldn't he be better as pesto? Then Omori can enjoy some spaghetti.
mmmm pesto by basil
Basil smoothie

I'm not, I wouldn't be able to die til Tuesday anyway

High on drugs that you found in basil house
It doesn’t help that basil was turned into a green liquid 
yup
I can't believe you did the Bagel dirty 
I swear every time I see him called Bagel here I think of [something entirely different.]()

u/basildoesstuff. .  what do you think basil?

Hello basil,i will give you some rare flowers and...a camera if you get into the blender
Hmmmm... What type of flowers?
Eeeeeeeee...ghost orchid?
Alright! I-Is the blender safe?
No
Yes
lmfao the amount of basil hatred in this community has me weak-. . i almost feel bad for him.
I think it’s just a loud minority, I did a poll on it and most people seem to like or love him. . 
that, and cuz people who do love him probably like making fun of him as well, like me.
That too. He does die in the game…. Like a lot, like a lot a lot
Is there even more basil deaths is the console version?
wait people hate him i thought it was a joke
I hate him so fucking much (affectionate)
precisely.
I personally don’t like him, but I have nothing against those who do

Is this not the face of hate ?
next im gonna see basil in that god awful gorey gif
I love Basil, but now I need to see this
No. Get help.
Put him in the machine 
What? Link?
The machine?

It seems like Basil got himself involved with the mess I explained above.
Behold, the post that started the great BASIL war of 2022.
Basil cute…
What's better than seeing basil dies in different ways. . 
Can you get me some of that basil smoothie later?
At least there are a million copies of Basil already in Headspace.
I really want to punt bagel smoothie from Omori to the mooooooon

Why u make basil soup
Sprinkle the basil all around.
Do you want to cut open Basil?
*proceeds to take a sip* . . (I still love you Basil)

Holy shit, you nailed it...! Bravo!! Seriously!!!   . Btw, for uploading gifs, as long as you've got the file and you're uploading from desktop, you should just be able to just choose to upload the file when you're posting something. At least, it was barely difficult for me when I did it.  . Also, I don't know why you're crediting me, lol. Yer not even using my template, and the other guy's template actually uses the correct backgrounds, rather than my lazy attempt at recreating them, haha.
Thank you so much!!                                                                                                                           Ah, so that's how you do it!

Hello! Are you still here? Where do I find these as individual gifs/images from your own distribution?. . I want them as both gifs and images. Your link has them all in a single gif/image without being separated one by one.. . And yes, your Basil battle portraits are honestly better than the official Basil battle portraits :3
 Basil's maniac face- **STEP ON ME.**
horni bastard
no he looks like hes gonna kill someone
Bro he's 12!!!
step
Do you mean that YOU want Basil to step on YOU? Or do you mean that BASIL wants someone to step on HIM???
This is lovely, looks like it belongs in the game! I was hoping someone would do Basil since he’s one of my favourites (I mean, I like them all but...). Also props for covering the whole range of emotions too!
Awwww, manic Basil is the first manic face I see that's actually cute and not demented
Still though, I want to delete it
are you sure about that bc half the comment section wants to funk him rn
Whatever your interpretation of cute is, it is not mine and therefore, I must disagree with you entirely.
Basil’s manic face.... . B-Basil... please put down those shears...
Really good work! I dunno if manic Basil is cute or scary yandere vibes.
Idk I feel like sunny means more to basil than just a friend you can come to. You might just say that. *it means everything* to basil
Well, I won't deny the possibility that Basil views Sunny as more than a friend, but I still think, in that moment, it was more of an abandonment/comfort thing, since Sunny was the only other person alive who could understand what Basil was going through.
This looks incredible!!!! I love it!!! My favorite’s gotta be the toast one
Manic basil Brianrot you did very well
Everything is perfect, the manic feels like he’s looking down on me (´・ω・｀)
I absolutely love this!. . Basil is just best boy, tbh.
i love the manic basil he cant look scary even if he tried
I mean he looks like he’s about to rape me
or maybe he’s just gonna make you some pesto?????
Wtf is pesto is that noodle?
: wtf is pesto is that noodle?
I want to know, where did you get the accurate toast png?
It's actually the first image that pops up when you search for toast png: . http://www.pngmart.com/files/5/Toast-PNG-Free-Download.png
Looks like it's taken straight from the game, awesome work!
nice!
Wow, this looks great! I love how all the expressions are in character
this is SO CUTE
omg this is awesome!! you nailed the game's art style❤️❤️
Heyyyyy, that's pretty good!
THIS IS AMAZING!!! I THINK IT MIGHT BE THE BEST I'VE SEEN SO FAR BECAUSE IT'S SO DAMN ACCURATE AND BELIEVABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR BASIL!!!.  Seriously, you did an amazing job! Also, Manic Basil is more terrifying than manic Omori, just sayin'~
I LOVE IT I love it so much.. I might try to do an AU about basil soon, if i can i'll draw it entirely myself, but just in case,  could i borrow it as a base? (not the template, basil.) (idk, its still on the plan stages).
Thanks!! Of course, glad I can help, looking forward to it!
oh my god, that manic face is so damn cute
happy basil  . bottom text
Manic Basil manic Basil 💓
The only critique that I have is the third emotion could've been more "extreme" (though it's my opinion), the artstyle however was perfectly done you deserve cookie.
Thanks for the feedback! I was a bit too worried about it staying in character that I forgot to exaggerate it \^\^'
Once again still great job!
You did God's work.  Congrats. Easily on of the best posts on this subreddit 💕💖
Everything here looks amazing, though I would suggest that the stressed out portrait have the red eyes seen during the basil's house cutscene.
This is extremely well done, i adore it
so precious oml
I reopened my reddit account after god know how many years just to say this:  . the manic's face is by far more scarier than furious, its been a while since i have seen such a "imma ravage your body" look like that, Omori just there having way too much fun and Basil there having fun even after the fight.
You are from the future, aren't you?
He got toast basil right
Aww, this is gorgeous!
This look perfect! Like its straight from the game :D
Manic basil a cute

There needs to be Omori p2 and Basil joins the fight or something
manic basil oh my!!!\~
thank god manic basil doesn't look like a psychopath

So cool, saw these in omori tenor gifs and turned the internet on it's head to find them lmao
manic basil looks like hes saying "ara ara"
angery basil is so cursed
Basils angry sprite looks like someone said the word frick or heck in the playground and now he's pissed, it's so cute I cant
Baisl tost 💀
Could you please share the color palette with me?
VERY COOL!
Ooh these are pretty. I think some of Basil's original portraits would fit better for some but its still super good!!!
Bro predicted the future
:D
Where are the red eyes.
I think he can still be missing an eye in the bad ending. Save Basil, lose the final fight, don’t get up, and boom. It’s a long way down from there.
why does basil sound female despite being a male💀
Its because the audio for it was originally a persona 3 ai meme. Basil is taking the place of yukari who's a girl
💀. Edit: why does this have -5 votes
Basil is a plant
BAGEL
bby boi basil ;-;
Basil really did come the cabbage patch
even yoda fuckin loves basil
ayo its rain town basil
Basil baby
bagel burrito
why is basil lettuce
Why not?
I want cabbage basil to have my children
Personally I was worried that if >!Basil's grandma died that he could lose the house.!<. . Hopefully Polly would sort something out.
good point, perhaps >!him and polly could sort something out with his inheritance money? and apparently basils parents are alive, they just travel a lot so maybe they own the house and not basil's grandma!<
Yeah. I can see Polly being there for Basil and trying to arrange something.. . Basil's parents are harder to pin down. >!We never see them, or even hear that much about them. Other than paying for Polly (if I remember correctly) they don't appear to have done much or particularly seem to have been there for Basil and their mother (/mother-in-law). It's hard to know how Basil (and Grandma) would feel about them, and Basil's parents about Basil.!<. . >!I could imagine grandma leaving Basil the house and Basil's parents paying upkeep. That, or the next serious issue Sunny and friends would be dealing with is how to house/take care of Basil.!<
Ah now you’ve got me thinking about a comic idea with the gang helping basil out with the house situation… I already have too many ideas lined up to draw noooo lol. Not a bad thing though haha
Could you imagine Basil having to move in with Aubrey?. . >!How would Aubrey deal with the mess? Would she apologise? Is she so used to it she doesn't notice until Basil arrives?!<. . >!Can just think of Polly, Basil and the gang ketting together to clean Aubrey's house, maybe even the delinquents help out too.!<
Auby. . Oof. That would hurt. Shame about the broken relationship.. . >!Would the mom get some sort of (attempted) intervention. Like, was she always neglectful (was she kind at heart or abusive)? What happened to make Aubrey's dad leave?!<. . Bagel. . >!I also wonder if Basil held any feelings of resentment towards his parents? Did the fact they're hardly ever there leave Basil with his fear of being abandoned? !<. . Even if it was for a good reason (e.g. they're massive humanitarians) it would still sting, right?
I think he meant the woman with basil
Ohhh, I see.
I always to those same mistakes lol, i got ya.
Everyone gangsta until Bun-Bun starts eating all of Basil’s plants
And Basil!. . >!Wait why is he holding a jump rope!<
And a hot plate!
I don’t know if you can tell but I love Basil
Basil
I found this video a couple days after my 16 yo nephew took his life - 6 months ago. There was a lot of anger toward this game as my nephew was a HUGE fan, was a Basil Boy, and his parents didn’t find out he was playing the game until he completed it 3x. In the end, we don’t know what caused a perfect boy to be struggling so much with no warning signs. I found comfort in his video. I miss my boy terribly. Nothing will bring him back. Even tho answers may never come. It’s awful how much teen S is an epidemic. Breaks my heart for the loved ones left behind.
I’m so sorry for your loss…
Thank you! Taking it a moment at a time! Some moments I’m inconsolably sobbing. Others I try to forget. 😔
I'm so sorry. . . I've dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts through my preteens (and later on). The scary thing about depression is that from the outside, it can come outta no where. You can seem like the happiest kid/person on the outside but unless they open up about it, you wouldn't guess. No one around me knew how much I struggled until I opened up about it years ago. . . Please know that you did your best. I can't imagine the pain you're going through.
Basil being surrounded: oh no people 
Oh look, a cute boy. Let's talk with him for no reason
Average player character in RPGs
I don’t even play Omori yet I have this urge to protecc Basil 
Prolific commenter award when you don't play omori... Do you just like the memes? The people?
Idk. . I got recommended the sub awhile back and sorta got hooked
Who actually likes the people here?

Get out of this reddit and keep yourself away from anything related to OMORI to avoid spoilers please
I'm sure it's too late, if you spend even a day here there's nothing left to spoil
Basil: Who said I was gay?
You are gay
me, i did
Of course not, I agree it's a very odd way of thinking on Basil's part. But nonetheless, it makes no sense to use that as evidence of him being "clingy", or having an "unhealthy attachment"
Oh, you like flowers and taking photos? You must be gay then. And then some* people will accuse you of homophobic for not believing Basil is gay because you don't want to reinforce those stereotypes. (That mainly happens in Omori discord)
>people will accuse you of homophobic for not believing Basil is gay because you don't want to reinforce those stereotypes. . Someone in these comments has already done that. Unfortunately it is not contained in the OMORI Discord
I saw that comment.... The funny part is that I'm not even straight, they were just making assumptions. And the concept of queer coding is just forced into the character,  there's no trace except what i just stated
>Liking gardening =/= feminine.. . He wears a flower on his head, only declined wearing a flower crown because he said it'd be too much, and has probably the most feminine-looking hairstyle out of the main boys.. . >using evidence of him being "feminine" as a way to put a sexuality onto him enforces harmful stereotypes.. . Fair enough, I originally had the part about OMOCAT closer to that as a way to draw parallels between him and Pretty Boy but I'll get there later.. . >Have you mfs never had friends?. . No. In all seriousness, Omori seems a bit more intimate with Basil than with the others, just by looking at their Tag photos and their Release Energy animation. Holding hands is also afaik a pretty romantically-charged interaction if you're not, say, leading the person you're holding somewhere or making sure you don't get lost, and they aren't in the Boss Rush.. . >He does not do this.. . The monologue before Basil's fight says he was bullied for years because he didn't want people to think Sunny scribbled over Mari's face in the photo album, and that he created SOMETHING as a way to argue with himself that Sunny was a good person that didn't actually do those acts. Maybe the word 'idolize' was wrong and I meant something more like idealize but it's too late now lol.. . >How far do you have to reach bro. . That [is actually a thing,]() and Berserk and NGE are the main culprits. Thinking about it for a bit longer I don't think OMOCAT's intention was necessarily romantic for this specific part, though, as the contrast could just be so he stood out a bit from the rest of the cast.. . >but I have not seen any evidence of herself admitting she is one. . Ok, this part. I found like three people saying she was a self-proclaimed fujoshi but couldn't find anything about her actually doing so. She did supposedly enjoy shotacon comics in 2014, but has deleted any and all tweets relating to that so it could very well be fake. Apart from that, I sincerely believe Basil was at least slightly inspired by Pretty Boy, his earlier design had similar hair, they both have flowers as a recurring motif and they're both pretty timid. As such, a supposed fujoshi who already made a shy, pretty boy gay, making another one with a very close friendship to another male character, can raise a few rainbow flags, even if it ends up being a false alarm. . >Sunny's crush on Aubrey. . Yeah this makes me really hesitant to say I'd like Basil being gay in the base game, it'd make an unnecessary love triangle, Sunny's canon relationship with Aubrey is objectively healthier, it makes the whole stuff from the incident way worse, it's just really bad imo. I mostly ship Sunflower and hc Basil as queer when I'm thinking about kinda canon-compliant scenarios, like a post-therapy reconciliation, or actual AUs, like OMARI or a universe where nothing went wrong.. . Thanks for reading, and have a good day!
Honestly when I first met him all I could think of was Basil the second…
it had nothing to do with the whole >!eye stabbing!< thing?
Nah it’s just his name is the same as a Byzantine Emperor
a byzantine emperor who was known for stabbing eyes and blinding people. . >!just like omori basil!<
Holy shit whaddya know 
I feel like if Kel looked like and talked more like Basil Suntan would be the most popular ship tbh, but despite having arguably equally important relationships with Sunny people headcannon Basil as gay because of stereotypes
valid point
Bagel boy
Fun fact : Basil made me gay
He's 16 
No matter the age he still made me gay, no turning back
DUDE wait are you a minor also
Man I just turned 13 this year
Hmmm... According to my calculations, your account is eligible for a ban! Since you turned 13 this year, and your account was made *over* a year ago, it is safe to say that you made an account when you were 12 years old, which goes against Reddit's TOS! 🤓
Can't have accounts on internet 🤦🤦🤦
Oh... phew
Did you still realize that Basil made me gay?
Okay...and?
Average Omori fandom discussion
Oh shit this is my first -6 upvotes!!! Thansk guys
"Pearl-clutching" describes it perfectly. . . It's also worth noting that Basil is most likely named after Basil Hallward from The Picture of Dorian Gray, a book that was on a bookshelf in the Omori demo.. . This is a quote from that character:. . >“I see you did. Don’t speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say. Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you. You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you. I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you. ". . And looking at the entire context and plot of the novel, there are some vague similarities to Sunny and Basil's relationship. . . So no, we can't say Basil is confirmed to be gay. But it's really not a very foolish hypothesis.
Except that (spoilers)  >!in the game Basil stabs Sunny and not the other way around!<. . But good call
My take: . . The good: If you want Basil to be queer/cis, so be it. If you want to show *why* you think he's queer/cis, that's okay too. That's your headcanon and you respect the opinion of anyone that disagrees with it.. . The bad: You want Basil to be queer/cis, so he *needs* to be queer/cis. "It's just a headcanon"? Miss me with that BS. Him being X because of X is a harmful stereotype.. . Conclusions: Discussing about headcanons involving sexualities can be tricky. Don't go too deep into it and you'll be fine.
I guess, personally i just don't get why people insist that a fictional character is straight or gay or pan or bi etc, if nothing is confirmed i think everyone can have their own headcanons witgout getting mad, if you wanna hear my opinion basil seems pretty gay to me but that is my thougt
I feel like Basil could have a pride flag in his room andthis fandom would say "It just means hes an aly"
I'm pretty sure when OMORI takes place he wouldn't have one.... . Even then this fandom isn't *that* object to Gaysil, hell i'm sure alot of people would be either "oh okay so he *is* gay." Or "I FECKING KNEW IT!"
I don’t like the stereotype of basil being gay ):
Tbh i headcanon basil to be bi
Whatever you want 
Let me explain why this is an issue that irks me a bit. Not this character in particular, mind you.... . If it was ever, at any point, confirmed that Basil was gay... Everybody's reaction would be "yeah, duh." Specifically because he's "queer coded". For those not in the know (just in case) queer coded simply means a character is meant to come off as obviously gay without it ever being confirmed because it's simply not relevant to the story in any way. I think it's safe to say that applies to Basil. Feminine appearance, hobbies, mannerisms, etc... (That so many people assume he's gay is proof enough he's queer coded, because his sexuality is never mentioned in the game but so many people have some to that conclusion almost to the point that's it's considered canon. It, of course, is not canon at all... but it's just kind of what the majority of people seem to go with.). . Now, yes... in an ideal world a male character could exhibit these traits and not be presumed gay. That would be amazing. I am of the opinion that men should be more in touch with their feelings. However, this is the part that irks me... that idealistic world view only ever seems to come up for queer coded characters. Because there is that non-confirmed layer of doubt, suddenly we need to start caring about "harmful" stereotypes. This is concern that only ever presents itself when it's convenient in *removing* a potentially gay character from a piece of media. It has the same energy of patting a kid on the head and saying "i know what's best, we're going to ignore your feelings and do what I want, trust me it's what's best for *you*!". . You can have your head canons, and you can leave people theirs, but when you start trying to come off like you're selflessly defending a community by erasing them from your media under the guise of (a sudden and enthusiastic interest in) progressivism that, to me, just comes off as disingenuous and... frankly, homophobic.
Based
i hope basil explodes
I think saying that basil is gay is the new reddit upvote meta 
coming from a gay femboy Basil is super gay
The difference between queer omori fans and omori fans reinforcing gay stereotypes is that We understand that Everybody in omori is queer . Not just basil.
Bruh this is literally  what the post was talking about. Basil should be gay based off how he interacts with guys and girls not what he wears . . Most blantant and facepalming sterotyping i've seen here yet.
I get that but to me we dont get anything about Basil up front all of his character is basically based off subtle moments. Plus im also gay so like i feel like i know it when i see it. . . Plus if were going there i mean hes pretty *close* to Sunny so the way he reacta to dudes is pretty close id say. . . And also there are feminine gays. I feel like were missing that. Those are actual people. Its stereotyping but i dont think its that bad. Its not like im saying its bad if hes straight and does all this, im just saying more effeminate guys tend to be gay, again thats my experience as a gay. Plus these are fictional characters so this really shouldnt effect real life
You feel like you know it when you see it because you’re better at pointing out gay stereotypes. I think that it’s fine to do this, because I feel like those stereotypes tend to be more true when it comes to gay people, but it’s not okay to say that someone is definitely gay because of them and they shouldn’t be considered as such.
Yeah i also dont think hes 100% confirmed gay either these are not all gay people have of course. Mostly just my HC
If Basil has a ugly design like for example a chubby guy, people will ship him now?
Yes because he would be more relatable
But how many? And they would re design him because they want him more 'cute' to ship?
Many unattractive people would compare themselves to him and ship him with others.  . Maybe some would redesign him, but I can't say for sure. Like, how many people redesigned ugly characters to ship them with others?
Very little
Ugly bastard tag has a word with you.
Well, I messed up my question
Noted
Basil is pan-
Aren’t basil’s parents dead? I thought I read that somewhere on the wiki.
no, their alive. their quote on quote, “too busy” or smth. Looking at the source for the wiki saying that theres a quote from polly.. . Polly: BASIL's lived with his grandma since he was a toddler. His parents always seem to be too busy... I've only ever seen them once.
Polly is just Basil's caretaker, not his mother iirc
I know, but she's definitely more of a parent than Basil's actual parents.
Yup but she's still not his mom
She’s not his mother, but she is his mom.
What about Basil's Grandma? She's not talked about much, but she was better than half of the parents' cast, right?
Fuck you're right I forgot that sweet ol lady. . My bad
Now that you mention it, yeah. Albeit Basil's actual parents likely sucked as well, his Grandma wasn't really a 'parent,' she was more like a caretaker to him, kinda like Polly.
I mean if it was referring to her as well, wouldn't it be sucked instead of suck?
I really want to punt Basil from Omori to the moon, but I feel like Polly would be sad if I did so I'll just focus on defeating the absolute beast that is headspace Basil (Wish me luck!)
Don't forget Basil's grandma
Oh, my bad. Last time someone said that kind of shit to Basil, >!they got stabbed in the eye. I guess they only survived by **shear** luck ✂️!<
I relate to Basil
flair checks out
I can relate to basil when it comes to being absolutely terrified of change
I kinda relate to the anxiety parts, basil's reaction is similar to mine
Sunflower or something idk. . Basil: "Hey fuck you". . Sunny: "wtf". . Sunny: "what did I do?". . Basil: "Idk you like boys". . Basil: "Do you have a crush on me yet?"
"wtf what did i do". . >!Abandon me for four years to deal with the crushing weight of our combined sins all alone and slowly go insane!<
real
You know basil, anytime someone calls attention to the breaking of gender roles, it ultimately undermines the concept of gender equality by implying that this is an exception and not the status quo
Huh?
good reference but not really relevant
>!Or Basil's rope!<
not sure, but this should probably be spoiler tagged.
That has low accuracy tho, >!the target has to be paralyzed first.!<
:you ruined them basil. . &#x200B;. . (throws them in the bin)
: ooooh, i heard this one is pretty good. What does it do?. . 🐴⚡️: ***I AM SPEED***. . : hoooly shit, Basil nuke coming when?
(basil would walk in the same park after aubrey leaves the park with the hooligans). . : why are kel and sunny lying on the ground, unconscious!?. . (what will basil do?)
(Basil takes a closer look at their bodies, and realizes that they're both bleeding. Then, he sees a nail and a strand of pink hair close by...). . : Oh no, this is bad! I... I have to do something.... . : Oh, I know! I'll go get Polly! She'll know what to do!
(basil would run to polly)
(Basil looks for Hero, but he's nowhere to be found.). . (What will Basil do?)
I agree with the first part but not the second, Basil >! already had been through so much guilt and nobody deserves bullying.. you can't really also blame him for the stabby because he had a psychotic episode, it's not like he was calculated and aware of what happened in reality!<
i see it mostly the other way where people say that aubery is a girlboss and stuff for bullying basil and the demonize him to insane degrees
Basil haters probably didn't even play the game
I think most basil haters like me are just doing it ironically though, could just be me
nah man I've heard people talking about how much they genuinely despise basil and how unforgivable he is (despite the opposite being literally the entire theme of the game)
Basil  is literally the nicest character in omori, he was put through the worst damn things and didn't snap once
Well he kinda did >!he tried to kill himself!< after all.
Yes, bullying basil because of scribbling the photos for a lot of time is a pos attitude. Just ignoring him completely would've been enough.
I simply hate watermelons
This turned into PCM pretty quickly
Literally me fr
So you admit to treason then?
Yeah, me too. (I personally watched the entire gameplay all Easter eggs too.)
Yup I fuckin hate Basil but I'll be the first to admit he did nothing actually wrong
I mean the plot of the game wouldn’t have played out like it did if that was true lol
so you basically said you are not a Basil hater lol
I played the game, and I couldn’t help but find basil annoying, sympathetic, yes, but putting myself in Sunny’s shoes across the endings really made basils presence feel anywhere from unsettling to annoying, which is kinda the point? I dunno. The way basils face starts to contort as they begin to anxiously lose rational thought is annoying, chad maladaptive daydreamer vs virgin panic attacker
but even that is weird because Sunny wants to help Basil, he doesn't put all the blame on him, and feels guilt for abandoning him, and still considers him the most important person of his life besides Mari, there must have been some  misinterpretation of his mindset if by putting yourself into his shoes... you hate Basil that much. Maybe it's Omori's shoes, but even Omori... still wants an happy slice of life with all his friends, Basil included. Sunny just hates to remember what he and Basil did, not Basil himself, he feels anxiety near Basil because that's what it reminds him, Basil knows everything and that makes their interraction uncomfortable.. . . Heck, Sunny jumps in the lake, goes to the bathroom, to Basil's room, to Basil's hospidal room, the last ones don't sound so cool but if you know the context they mean something
I hate basil because he is sad and pathetic. I love hating him because it's funny
Projecting much?
look at this thing. He is utterly puntable
Don't dare say that about the bagel boy
&#x200B;. . 
I think my biggest annoyance with the fanbase, is how Bagel is treated as a character. He's easily the most misrepresented character. His entire personality and character is always either summarized as "Gay Flower Boy" or "Total Psychopath and Deserves 100 years in Jail". There is almost no in-between. This oversimplification of his character is honestly kind of sad to see, because he's easily the most complex character of the bunch, but he's also probably the most misunderstood character.. . It's incredibly sad to see, as someone who's favorite character playing the game was Basil, to see how the fanbase generally treats him and his character. The discussions always boil down to "He's probably evil or smth idk" instead of actual discussions about how interesting he is as a character. For example, one thing I thought about the entire game, was the fact that Basil probably suffered the most out of anyone after >!Mari's death!<. Hell, even Sunny probably suffered less, if only because of headspace. Basil had no headspace however. Basil:. . * Has no present parents, and his grandma is literally dying.. * Lost all his friends. They either went to college, locked themselves away, or even started bullying him. Only Kell stuck around (the real one he is).. * Took the blame for everything Sunny did after the event. This, of course, caused Aubrey to hate him leading to the bullying.. * Literally had to go to school with the guilt of knowing what he and Sunny did, hoping that nobody ever finds out.. . I don't know if anyone else understands the feeling of having done something and not wanting someone to find out, but having no control over that, but that feeling is easily tied with being hungry for how awful it is. The hints that Basil is suffering more are even highlighted by the fact he's the first person to actually choose to >!commit the dead!< in the neutral route. It's not Sunny, who you'd think would want to do it the most considering, but no. It's Bagel who acts first because he had no one else to fall back on, unlike Sunny who had his Headspace. Obviously none of this is to say each character didn't suffer, or a competition on who suffered less. It's just a point to highlight when people bring up Basil as a character and misrepresent him as Frollo levels of evil.. . The herb boy is so grossly simplified and misrepresented in the fandom that it's really sad. For a game that has such a good message, it's really sad to see people honing in on a single character and portray they so commonly in a bad light, all because of a single action. Considering the true ending of the game, that quite literally throws the entire message of the game away.
i think basil is interesting within the fandom because he's a really good example of how scapegoating can be propagated; to the point where it extends outside of the fictional friend group in the game to the real beliefs of the fandom itself. (>!psychology sidetracking below since this is a good topic imo!<). . basil is easy to shit on because there's no actual reasons to not shit on him that the game provides you. he victimizes himself by taking on the blame for his friend's wrongdoings because he'd rather see himself as the problem than them. to sympathize with him requires the effort of putting yourself in his shoes on your own and willfully trying to understand his motives which some people might be less open to doing than others. . . the game--assuming that you want to offer him the sympathy and moral support he needs--provides you the option to help him out, **but**: sunny is perfectly fine >!fucking off and leaving basil to die because it means he can repress him and all of his own wrongdoings that basil took the blame for without consequence or difficulty. that's why the neutral ending isn't called the "bad ending" despite being "the worst" ending; basil killing himself is quite literally the natural, expected result of the situation taking it's course on him;!< he's that hopeless.. . since basil's wellbeing relies entirely on the sympathy of the player/mc and half of the remaining cast heavily feeds into his unconditional self-blaming (sunny+aubrey), someone attached more closely to that portion of the cast may rather try and justify those character's actions by reasserting basil as the problem as a lot of people lack the nuance that both sides may be flawed and would initially believe it's one or the other who is "at blame". . ...and basil, naturally, is the easier target because his character doesn't actually defend himself in any way and is the identified patient (scapegoat) of the friend group's interrelated wrongdoings i.e. the person presenting all of the symptoms of conflict: since he's constantly the one seemingly at blame for all of their problems and pleading forgiveness >!(often for things he didn't do)!<, if you remove him everything will "seem" fine even though it actually isn't. that's why sunny can so easily carry on by >!repressing his suicide and thus entire existence in the real world,!< because he was the only thing reminding anybody that something was wrong with them in the first place. he's the only one who tries to take on the burden of everyone else's issues so it's only natural to conclude that he is the issue himself that they must be rid of.. . people who resonate with his character more are more likely to actually understand his position (as is with any other character) but his position is predisposed to defenselessness thus receptive to vitriol- if that makes any sense- so he naturally leans towards being an easy punching bag for a self-driven community like this one because he doesn't make any canon moral arguments to justify himself. basil's morality is at full mercy to the empathy of whoever judging him. . . i agree people should actually treat the characters with the individual nuance and sympathy they deserve since a lot of the fandom likes to make it a black-white "well, who's worse?" scenario, just wanted to go on a tangent explaining why his reception is so (unfairly) polarized since he's a more delicate and complex character. (>!and it's so sad that basil, aubrey, sunny are all incredibly lovable and flawed characters who made up in the true ending yet people still want to argue over the traumatic conflict they canonically accepted their hurtful roles in and tried to move on from.!<)
Damn bro, take my upvote.
This is all so fantastic. Really amazing explanation of how a lot of people seem to see Basil.. . I didn't mention it in my original post, but I definitely do agree with how people tend to have a problem with sympathizing for two sides, especially when the two sides were both involved in **Something**. It feels like for a lot of people, it seems like it's instinctual to have to idolize one of the sides, and then villainize the other. It's a fantastic example of how taking things at face value, and not looking at the world in black and white shades really helps in understanding certain contexts. It's honestly really worrying how people argue over who has the worst trauma. Like dude, even if it's just a game, you should never argue over who has been through the most, especially when most people haven't even experienced what certain character might go through. Obviously, and again, it's just a video game, but that shouldn't change the fact that it's still interesting to talk about these things, but how Basil is treated by most of the fanbase, that's a problem because it actively impedes real discussion about his character.. . I think my favorite part is how the game handles Basil, or at least his relevance to the story. He's barely even in the game for the majority of the early and even middle parts. He feels like a ghost so when he does show up, he leaves a big impact. And while it's a bit of a story tangent, I love how this is explained because Basil is really the only person who truly knows about the incident. It's a great way of showing how important Basil really is, because of how little he's present.. . But my favorite part of all, is how it is literally impossible to get the >!true ending!< without interacting with his plants. He is literally the most vital part of getting the >!true ending!<, but it's never mentioned, nor explained that this is the case. It is entirely out of the want of the player (or the spoilers) that they end up watering his plants to get the >!true ending!<. I think if he was anymore present in the story, it might end up ruining the impact that his flowers really have.. . It really highlights how important Basil actually is, because without helping him get over his trauma and fears, it's impossible to truly help yourself/Sunny. It's also a great way of showing that it's entirely up to you as the player if you want to truly help the kids or not. It's a complete individual decision to water those plants, and the game never tells you, and I love that.
>he person presenting all of the symptoms of conflict: since he's constantly the one seemingly at blame for all of their problems and pleading forgiveness (often for things he didn't do), if you remove him everything will "seem" fine even though it actually isn't.. . I didn't really see Basil as the scapegoat considering that most of his friends treated him normally. Only later does Aubrey explain why she bullied Basil in the first place which paints the picture of Aubrey as the only one who actually blamed him for anything. Basil did scapegoat himself as the one who drew over the pictures but I think that's minor compared to the big reveal.. . >to sympathize with him requires the effort of putting yourself in his shoes on your own and willfully trying to understand his motives which some people might be less open to doing than others.. . The whole sequence in real life was made to sympathize with Basil >!even after blaming himself for the photos.!< He is constantly the target of Aubrey and the rest of her friends and Sunny and Kel are given the goal of trying to protect him.>! As the risk of Basil commiting suicide increases, I think most people felt compelled to save him. The reason why people hate him so much is because of his involvement with the incident and attempted murder of Sunny at the end which is completely contrary to his character up to that point. I think that if Basil was replaced with any other character in devising the plan to stage Maris suicide, they would get almost if not the same amount of hate simply because coming up with the idea of a staged suicide is much worse than committing the accident in the first place for some. If any other character tried to murder Sunny in fear of them leaving, I think they would get a lot of hate too.!<. . Also, I think its also hard to say that Basil suffered more>! since Mari and Sunny were obviously a lot closer being siblings.  !<. . >Literally had to go to school with the guilt of knowing what he and Sunny did, hoping that nobody ever finds out.. . Being able to go to school is a sign that things are better off for Basil considering that he is even capable of having social interaction even if he didn't have any friends. Sunny on the other hand is unable to go to school at all and basically doesn't talk to anyone but his mom.. . >Hell, even Sunny probably suffered less, if only because of headspace. Basil had no headspace however.. . Even with headspace, Sunny is still haunted by his extreme fear and hallucinations in the real world. If Basil is capable of going to school and acting relatively normal despite his anxiety and guilt, it's implied that he is able to cope in his own way significantly more effectively.. . &#x200B;. . >>!The hints that Basil is suffering more are even highlighted by the fact he's the first person to actually choose to commit the dead in the neutral route.!<. . I think it's kinda arbitrary to say that one commited suicide before the other since it's basically inevitable sunny commits suicide in the neutral ending even through the omori route where he never gets to see Basil irl.. . I do agree tho that it's bad to be oversimplified as either the stereotypical evil character or the gay flower boy since there is plenty of nuance in his character. I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified.
While I'm not certain if you meant to respond directly, I'll answer some things.. . >Being able to go to school is a sign that things are better off for Basil considering that he is even capable of having social interaction even if he didn't have any friends. . . I think there is a little more nuance to this than just saying "He can do something that the other can't, therefore better off". That's a little simple. Just because Basil is able to do something, doesn't mean he's better off, or not suffering more. Just because someone can go to work everyday, doesn't mean that there aren't issues in their life. People can hide things, and Basil has evidently hidden the truth for all the time that Sunny was hidden in Headspace. . . The biggest point though, is character progression. Generally, the most painful part about trauma, other than the trauma itself, is accepting that it happened. Sunny at the point of the game, is a constant static character. He's trapped and literally isn't able to accept it because that's what would truly hurt. It's only because of Kel that Sunny was able to accept things. Basil was in a constant mix of accepting it and denying it. He knows for a fact of what they did, but he's always denying it because he doesn't want to accept it. It's a constant back and forth, and every time it he thinks of it, it probably hurts him. I think that, personally, it would be a lot better to just not be able to think of something, over having to wrestle with myself over if it really happened, knowing full well that it did. . . So just because he's able to go to school, doesn't mean he's better off mentally. If anything, it probably means he's worse off because he doesn't have a sleepy little daydream to escape to.. . > I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified. . . My main issue isn't if the hate is justified. I think a little criticism is good for everyone. My main issue is how none of the other characters are even remotely criticized as much, or as harshly. Sunny is almost never criticized to the point of Basil, and that just feels unfair. It feels like the mentality of needing someone to hate. Someone has to be labelled "worse" because there always has to be someone responsible for bad actions. And it seems like most people settled for Basil. . . It also doesn't help that Basil is probably the most complex character in the game, written and gameplay-wise. He barely appears in the game, even near the end, so most people reasonably can't get a read on him. However, it's the nuance that he never appears that pushes his character. Think about the flowers. It is never told tot he player that they can go back and water his flowers after the first part, and this is entirely intentional. It is entirely up to the player wanting to do something nice, wanting to help someone, that ends up allowing them to get the true ending. It's entirely up to the player wanting to help Basil, that ends up netting them the best outcome. . . This is pretty much how all of Basil's character is told. Every bit of his character, with no exceptions, is told through nuanced bits. >!His fight, Final Duet!<, his appearances. His character is almost never actually obvious, and his history is even less obvious. For a character like Aubrey, we are pretty much told that her family isn't the best. It's pretty bad actually. But we're never told about Basil's parents, and can really only see what's implied. He says that they're always travelling and never really home. Obviously this doesn't mean they're bad people, but if they're never home, they are pretty bad parents. This is just one example of the player having to actively look and analyze the nuance of Basil's character instead of it being told face-value.. . Sorry if that sounded harsh. Hope that got at least a bit of stuff across.
It hurts a lot of what I see from these people.... Basil is my favorite. Because im more of an omori when i was going through shit. And I admire basil more. Im sad now
And I don't like how people continually make it seem like Basil has nothing to atone for.
Who tf does that?. . I have not seen this attitude even  a single time.
Er, the post I was responding to?
Yes, he shares some responsibility for the framing. But it was Basil's idea.
Where did I imply that Basil gets a pass?. . It's not like I said that what he did was justified.. . All I said was that Sunny imho did worse in this situation, not that Basil did nothing wrong.
The coverup was worse than the stairs, and that was Basil's idea and he was the one primarily doing it.
I disagree.. . Pushing someone down the stairs, consciously refusing to call an ambulance, and then making it look like suicide is worse than the cover-up alone.. . The push alone would be easy to forgive, if he actually had called an ambulance, but he actively redused to do that.. . Additionally, while the method was atrocous, at least Basils motivation was justified.. . The same cannot be said for Sunny.
> consciously refusing to call an ambulance. . [citation needed]
>\[citation needed\]. . Here you go:. . >Photo of Guilt  . >  . >***You want to scream for help, but you're afraid...*** you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? There's no way you can tell them the truth. ***Who would be able to forgive him?*** Who would believe... that it was... an accident?. . Not sure how else I'm supposed to interpret this.. . It's grossly neglicient.
> Not sure how else I'm supposed to interpret this.. . As being from Basil's perspective? Note that it's "Who would be able to forgive ***him***?".
>Because his dialogue on the matter reads very much as if he's trying to convince himself.. . I very, very strongly disagree. His dialogue reads to me as if he wouldn't have done jackshit if not for his psychosis.. . But I guess that's a matter of interpretation.. . >Also it really damages the themes of the game if Basil is insane and doesn't know what's real and what's not.. . . Like, that is what is actually implied.. . Are you seriously telling me to just ignore that?. . Like, why?. . That's the entire point of his character.. . A genuinly insane person whose actions are based on exactly that.
> That's the entire point of his character.. > . > . > . > A genuinly insane person whose actions are based on exactly that.. . See if that's the case Omori turns into an entirely different story. It's not about owning up to the truth and seeking forgiveness, it's about getting mental health treatment for someone delusional enough to be a danger to themselves and others. And it clearly isn't that.
Not sure how so, but I guess that's fair.. . That's just the way I always felt about Basil.. . Sunny and Basil are completely different characters, and I fail to see why they'd have to share the exact same struggle.. . To me, they very clearly represent two completely different issues.. . I guess it's a matter of interpretation and perspective.. . But I think considering both of their roles to be the same to be a huge mistake.
“Basil is so cute and innocent!”. My Brother in Christ, he >!hung the corpse of his friend’s sister in an attempt to frame it as a suicide.!<
That just makes me feel even worse for him. . He was a kid, not a psychopath. He must have learned that somewhere like on tv or smth because his parents weren’t there to stop it idk.
As someone who does gardening, a noose is a very common knot that most people who deal with plants would know. It's commonly used to hang plants up and stuff, so it would be completely fair to assume that Bagel learnt how to do that just by nature. . . Literally.
Yeah, that too. . . But the ’staging a suicide to cover up manslaughter’ part he could’ve easily seen in a movie or smth
Those two statements are not mutually exclusive
I mean sure he can still be cute, but innocent not so much.
Chad headspace bagel vs virgin faraway town bagel
Everybody makes mistakes 
...that's not a casual oopsie...
that was not a casual situation either. Bigger stakes, bigger mistakes :p. Can't expect a kid to act rationally
I'm gonna be honest, fandom often says that some people think he is innocent but I've never seen this take. Maybe someone was saying this ironically?
I just finished the game yesterday, got the good ending and secret ending on my first time, and do people really despise Basil for what he did. I know it caused more problems than solved it but, I am curious if >!Sunny was in it as well since we kinda saw him carry her body to help Basil but it is f- up that Basil took photos of it happening which typing this out, made me realize it was messed that Basil did it!<
>!basil did not *literally* take photos of mari's hanging. the segment where you recover and watch through all the "photos" is meant to represent basil's recollection of the incident!<
Ohhhh I forgot there was a part where >!A mirror is shown and there's no camera!< I just finished yesterday and already messed up the story 😭
You should read the [unused descriptions]() for the black space album, they explain >!a lot of the details of what exactly happened plus Basil and Sunny's thought processes. Basically Sunny was in a completely dissociative state and just went along with what Basil was telling him to do, hoping it'd be over soon and not fully believing it was even real. Basil on the other hand was desperate to protect Sunny from consequences, not thinking that anyone would believe it was an accident.!<
Unused content isn't canon though.
I understand it was the panic of the situation that made him do it,but it still super fucked yo
I guess it also adds that they were really young at the time and didn't know what to do
Dude, basil IS cute and innocent because he didn't kill anyone and his a murder for his best friend. Best omori character.
Yes, hanging your best friend's dead sister is very innocent.
He did it for friendship. He is innocent.
Just because you did it to help someone does not mean it's good. Especially covering up a murder.
So you would have let your best friend's life get ruined... Basil isn't the bad one here.
I'm not saying he's evil, he's just not good either. He's in a grey area. And you seem to be ignoring the point that Basil literally hid evidence for a murder.
Basil is not in a grey area at all, literally everything he did is justified. He is the nicest character in the game and the best friend anyone could have.
Yes, and hid evidence for A FUCKING MURDER! Ii'm not saying he isn't nice, but he isn't innocent, because he comitted a crime!
Manslaughter is not murder. He is innocent because he didn't do anything wrong morally.
Because hanging a dead body to cover up "manslaughter" is morally right.
Not doing that would only have hurt everyone even more. So yes, it is morally right.
How would it even hurt everyone even more?
You're ignoring the context of Basils psyhosis though.
Basil when melon
I totally feel you! When I see people who hate Basil it makes me assume most of the fans must be kids who don’t really get the game because Basil is almost as much of a victim as Sunny and sacrificed everything for him
It's an horror rpg, it's about a boy who lives in his dream world because he's an escapist, he can't accept an harsh truth, when he wakes up he sees Something, so he decided to live an ideal life in his dreams, but sometimes he's tormented by Something there too. His journey is about finding peace, and to save his best friend Basil who seems to have drifted away
What about basil he needs mental support?
Sunny and basil were also really good friends and hero cares about basil as well.
Ye but well sunny is kimda afraid of basil becouse >!something and he kimda reminds him of the truth(i think)!< and hero is in collage and it was that time where aubrey was really angry at basil for >!"Ruining" the photo album!< so he only got kel
Ye thats what i waa talking a bout he ia afraid of something and basils somrthing migth remind him of that maybe but here is the thing aubrey was angry at basil so kel was angry at aubrey and sunny didnt go outside for >!4years!< si thats why basil only had kel
When the gang discovers the weed of Basil:
You're=You are so you can mark Basil down for technicalities
Basil: Well Kel I think I am smart enough to be able to come up with a work around  for such restrictions and still create a working sentence. How was that Sunny?. . Snuuy: Basil you just used the letter ***A*** multiple times.. . Basil: Shit.
But who are you saying that to Basil isn't in the post
Anyone. . (Wait actually no)
A risky declaration
Wait can I take that back
Can you?

YOU CANT CATCH ME IM NOT GOING THERE NOT AGAIN!!!
What is that link
Child character .
"BASIL joined the game"
There’s even a tree there...
NO
I find it completely plausible that Basil has a genuine fear of the Pacer test
The what
The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
Good bot
Except you can't lap if you never turn.. . Invalid instructions, ran out of range.
Instructions unclear, >!fell up the stairs.!<
Who doesn’t
Now Basil defying logic to lift all of them at once.
Now Basil >!lifting Mari and going to the tree with a jump rope.!<

The biggest april fools joke would be them saying they finally shipped my basil plush
This is wonderful but I also want a Basil one
: You got something you want to say Basil?. . : No it's just, why 200 slides?. . : Because the Powerpoint could only fit 200 at a  time!
: I wanna see : … : I’m not sure this is school appropriate : shut it Basil! This sounds funny as hell : What’s so Wrong with the picture? : It’s in the album right? :Ooooooooo- : go away you annoying pig
I just finished the game weeks ago and am in the same kinda rut you are in. Lots of content from 2021-2023. Must’ve been its Golden age.. . At least the subreddits kinda active, let’s plays are still happening, places like Wplace had tons of characters etc. In retrospect, I’ve seen a ton of Basil PFPs.. . It could be worse. I’ve seen deader fandoms.
I will never forget about this game. I have merch all over my house & wear my Basil sweater often 🩷
I have a feeling Basil will suffer if you put on the trucks
Doesnt he always suffer, somehow
And also make the board look bad. But it's fine if you just hang it on the wall.
I will snap someone's neck at any moment (dont worry it's not yours bagell
Don’t snap my bagel boi’s neck
the only thing holding me together in life is basil
thanks bagel
I feel like she is white to like basil
The joke is that Basil is widely considered to be gay
Oh thank god I thought this was a Amy Rose Sonadow situation.
the joke is that basil is considered to be gay
Basil... put your garden shears away Basil...
Im not gardening with ya right now basil
Personally I think Dad is Asian and Mom is white American, at least that’s what I gathered from the family picture. What do you think? . . Also thanks! Byzantines have a famous Basil, omori has a famous Basil >!both had a thing for eye stabbing!<. Coincidence? I think not!
Oh, so that's why >!Basil stabs people on the eye!!<
: >! oi, oi, oi... there really innit a way out of this... eh, bruv? !<. . : What are you even saying?!
This has ruined me thanks
As a British person I am sobbing and crying this is comedy gold
The funniest thing about this is the way you used ‘innit’
Hey, spoiler
Basil is British, do you know how little that narrows him down. He could be English, Scottish, whelsh, unionist or Manx
Basil's Irish take it or leave it
know if that's the case the important question is he a catholic or protosident and how many times has his family either been or nearly falsely/geuinly imprsioned/almost blown or blown up. Remember this is in the 90s ireland was just off the good friday agreement
YES! BRITISH BASIL IS THE BEST HEADCANON!!! /srs
are refering to english basil or scotish basil or whelsh basil or manx basil or norhtenr irish basil
probably also asian (in the end duet scene when she and basil were holding hands her skin tone is noticeably different)
Nah, Basil’s pasty as hell, #FFFFFF-looking motherfucker
must be english
i think basils just really fucking white and aubrey is just a little more tanned
tbf out of all the characters, basil prob touches grass the most.
But not necessarily outdoors anymore.
Basil the british
Imagining Basil speaking with a Quebec accent is the last thing that would've come in my mind, and yet it isn't that bad
I just mean he's of quebec decent I image his voice sounding like armin from attack on titan. Young basil though to me sounds like Barbatos atleast that's what my head cannon is.
Basil from Canadia
Quebec is Canadian
yes, Basil from Canadia, like I said
I remember seeing a post that made Basil Hitler,. . . Guess Basil is an aryan
Basil is definitely a little German boy
They don't outright say it because its not really important but its heavily implied by the things you find at their house, you dont have to know basils exact heritage to know he's white lol
The only thing in their house that could imply that they're Mexican is that one altar looking thing but besides that not really. As for Basil what, he's got blonde hair and blue eyes therefore automatically purely white? Y'all making some wack assumptions over headcanons that don't really matter.
basil is walter white?!
Korean, maybe? Idk, I seem to like the idea of the friend group being VERY diverse, because I also like to believe that Basil is swedish or german.
Thank you Basil😘❤✨
Phones didn't even exist in the 80s, she obviously stole Basil's camera🤷🏿‍♀
>!Thats so real, I ugly cried when they forgot Basil.!<
I also see an oversaturation of posts about Basil or art without a source, which both are tiring.
True she may of bullied Basil but Sunny was the one who marked the photos so she assumed it was Basil. It's both a bad and understandable move since they're best friends.. . Although I see your point
Again i get that she saw the marked photos and got upset which is fine. But bullying the low self esteem loner kid with all tour friends isnt what id call fair. And yeah especially since it seems like Aubrey and Basil were also very close.
You literally proved my point.. "anymore" meaning that is what they were which is the point and go you're grasping at straws trying to say it was "filtered" no they weren't it was literally just them as the game proves literally in the older versions of themselves and no funny you mention reading comprehension as you completely missed what it meant by coping mechanism.. the point is sunny refuses to acknowledge mari's death as he choses to not acknowledge all his trauma therefor he imagines a unchanging world literally just a world that didn't change also to mention once again all dreamworld versions literally carry on into the real world in the dream world mari liked hero and hero liked mari and the real world it's heavily implied they had feelings for each other which you seem to purposely ignore or just somehow missed for mpre proof on the many just as he did with basil when he died basil's bathroom door simply dissappeared that was his coping mechanism not reimagining basil which funny as he's never done that with any of them his coping mechanism was forgetting and pretending it didn't happen also funny you mention when they beat up basil that wasn't to show they were only his coping mechanism that was him imagining what they'd do to him should he tell them the truth which was the only imagined thing
Yeah. I do still love her after that but what she did to Basil i think is hard to defend
Omori doesn't control their minds but instead he can delete them if they do/say something wrong just like he did to basil
He also did that to >!the wise one I think? The girl in the stay at home route deep in the recesses of his mind who was one of his first creations who got exiled for speaking about his trauma!<
YIKES, SPOILERZ MAN
How is it a spoiler? That thing happens so early I don't see your point
Yeah, but >!it's not revealed that its omori, at the beginning and most of the game, the player doesnt know what's going on with basil!<
ah yes, because you will 100% not find spoiler of omori in the omori subreddit
It’s literally the most obvious thing ever
I feel like Basil would either cry or channel all of that naive chaotic energy of his and answer the question
Now how would the latter option go?
Basil: "Huh? What do you mean how? I would just open my mou-". . Kel: "BASIL NO! I was joking... 😳"
fbi open up
*brings out a bag of brazil nuts*
In a probably illegal way
>!Basil would grab the shears!<
>!Basil used Cut!!<

Why'd you have to make Basil cry?? That's a punishable offense!
Kel, this jury has found you guilty of making Basil cry in the first degree. You are sentenced to one bonk!
Make it two, just for the fact that he used a DEEZ NUTS JOKE!
Two whole bonks!? Now that's just cruel
I think it's a worthy punishment for making Basil cry with a 'Deez nuts' joke.
Cruel? That's lenient as hell! The minimum amount of bonks that can be given for such a heinous crime is 30!
We’ll give him 1000! And... what’s this? It says to... >!”give basil one killer bonk”? Who wrote this? WAIT OMORI NO-!<
Fuck this, I'm bringing the horny hammer.
Oh God no!!!
>!Ah, sorry, must’ve missed that when I was correcting dumb stuff he did…!<. . >!***changes it to “give Basil a hug and a headpat”***!<
Cant he be sentenced by an eye loss, your honor?
No sorry, only one "eye loss" a year, we already used it
The artist is [@machiiattoo]() on insta
Why You make Basil cry
Some people only want to watch the world burn, (like Omori lol) and by "world" i mean Basil
>and by "world" i mean Basil. . Ofc basil is your world, no explanation is needed
omori

Hilarious but can we appreciate the art style? It's soooooo perfect for this meme! Basil crying had me crying laughing on the floor hahahah.
this is why. . >!basil prefer to dies in natural ends!<
But do you know who Candice is?
Basil: \*sniff\* "Candice? No I don't know who she is". . Kel: "CANDICE DI-"

Basil became miserable, he can no longer become happy or angry
We need a crying Basil Omoji.
“Hey, basil wake up. Act like a wimp with me like you always do! Please… please…” ~one nut later~ “I’m so fucked up”


That’s actually Basil when he was an edgy kid with black hair and his grandmother, so the Eva reference is uhhh, worse in this case

WHAT THE FUCK
I'm not talking about your bed Basil

it was your presents

the weed felt like a present

: Yo Basil what if we shared a bed together . . :
: Fuck it. Ima get in bed with Basil and you can’t stop me
: Why are you gae?
: Basil is hot
: Understandable.
: Omorrriiiiii\~
: What?
: *gay noises*
: Don't do gay stuff to me, we're like 12.
:*watermelon noises*
: Much better.
: what the fuck
: This does not concern you.
: YES IT FUCKING DOES YOU MONOCROME BASTARD
: Why?
: BECAUSE HE JUST GOT SPLIT LIKE A WATERMELON???? ARE YOU N O T CONCERNED???????????
: Nope.
: It could've been much, much worse. He's gonna be fine.
: Weak. He didn't even live to see why I make mini Basils.
: I'll fill the entire Headspace with Basils.
: I will banish **myself** into Blackspace if that happens
: I'll fill it with Basils too. Anywhere you go, there will be Basils.
: I can literally control the dream world stop threatening me
: And so can I.
He can kill them all in blackspace. . hubris
: Mini Basils?! That's so cool! C'mon Omori, lets plant these basil seeds!
So based
No, Basil just probably got that expensive high quality mattress lmao. . . Sharing a bed during a sleepover ain't a crazy concept
So basil be a freak in the streets and a king in the sheets with that good good memory foam orthopedic shiz topped with the finest Egyptian cotton and satin is what you're sayin? . . I can dig that. My dude knows how to nap.

He got a sleep country gift card for christmas
It came from his parents, alongside the letter they sent explaining they wouldn't be able to make it home for Christmas for the 8th year running.
Fr like if it was just me and my best friend when we were kids we shared my bed. When it was our whole group (five girls) my parents would lend us their room and we’d sleep in a row on their king and watch movies on their TV. Miss those times man.
In most sleepovers I've been to you don't share the bed.... . Although tbh Basil's the kind of kid to offer his bed and sleep on the floor himself.
Nah bro basil got that sleep country gift card
I actually cant remember if he says anything for the other 3 but i feel like that further makes Basils stick out. And again it was a conscience decision to make Basils bed the one to stick out and i think its deep. . . But then again i think i just look super deep into every detail cause my outlook on most games are, hey this detail was made with an intention, what can we get out of that detail and i think this is one. I think this game  is full of these really tiny details that at least mean something.
Pretty sure he rates beds based on his friendship with whoever the owner of the bed is. In this case, Sunny and Basil are best friends, so naturally he finds Basil's bed the most comfortable.
Everyone's bed is uncomfortable but his and Basil's
Oh really? Nevermind then.
Basil is British confirmed
Idk if anyone's said this but maybe it implies Basil has his own version of headspace?
Okay how deep does this rabbit hole go
d e e p
sleepover at basils house because he's the type of guy to say "I can sleep on the floor it's ok"
Exactly
I'd sleep with Basil
Sunny also says the blankets on the floor/bed in Basil's living room looks comfy, so I think he might just feel safer in Basil's house since they were best friends? Idk
He could have just pushed down on the mattress with his hand or sit on it when he interacted with Basils bed????
sl. sleepover?. . but he hasn't met basil's parents or caretaker...
His grandma took care of him before she became to ill and Polly came
I think it was the blankets on the floor in the living room when they were >!sleeping over at Basil's house towards the end of the game!<
Basil gets bitches and the male equivalent of bitches
I think its somewhere in r/Basilcult
You should of had basil continue and omori slightly fall aslepe
Guess you could say Basil is picturing the light
As much as I hate to say it, most of the blame would probably fall on Basil. In Sunny's case, it was a complete and unfortunate accident that you couldn't really hate him for. His reaction afterwards was natural, that of a traumatised kid, locking himself away. Basil, despite having good intentions to try to protect/save his closest friend, made things terribly worse by fabricating a lie that literally everyone believed and possibly blamed themselves for...and, besides Sunny helping Basil carry Mari downstairs, it was entirely Basil's plan in the panic of the moment. It definitely doesn't help that they'd be finding this out on Sunny's last day there...
It is also important to remember Basil considered Sunny his best friend, I know this doesn't make him innocent, but at least it is a fact that he would be pretty desesperate in that situation, and would try his best to make his friend safe.
Basil did make it worse for everyone, but he also made it worse for himself. Jut saying "It was Basil's fault" ignores the pain that he's experiencing. He was also like 12 when it happened. Not only was his brain developing, it was being put under stress that a developing mind shouldn't be under. I doubt that most people would have been able to make a better choice at that age, especially considering Basil and Sunny's relationship.
We have an unreliable narrator who has a living shadow inside of him thats trying to destroy him the entire time though, I can't entirely remember but don't they show an expression on Sunnys face in the dark photo album where he seems calm and collected? I don't think it was solely basil's plan, I see two 12 YEAR OLD KIDS trying to approach something that most adults wouldnt be able to.
There’s actually bonus content on an alternate route which tells you exactly what Sunny was thinking the entire time. He couldn’t process that what was happening was real and he kept trying to force himself to wake up. He was totally delirious and didn’t even realize what they were doing and didn’t fully realize Basil was even there until Basil grabbed his hand after they were finished hanging the body. All he heard was a voice say “it’s gonna be okay, follow my lead” and he went along with it while barely knowing what was happening. Honestly I do mostly blame Basil, although I know he was just trying to protect his friend, he made everything so much worse for everyone.
You can't blame a kid for that.
Maybe “blame” isn’t the right word. What I mean is that Basil is at fault for just how bad the situation became. I’m aware he was a kid and he was panicking and trying to protect his friend, but if Basil hadn’t staged it as a suicide (I know Sunny did too but he was delirious and just following Basil’s lead), then things would have turned out very differently. Staging as a suicide made things so much worse.
[basil be like]()
I feel like Basil made something that Sunny should have dealt with his own issue making both of their lives worse in the long run. Basil should have never got involved with the incident whatsoever.
Eh, I'd say we don't actually get enough details to judge; plus Basil was just a kid who wanted to protect his friend, I wouldn't say that most of us as children would come up with a plan as fucked up as his, but at the spot, seeing the usually calm and collected Sunny breaking down, it's fair to want to protect him from the law. Basil just went way too far in the midst of panic. And to be fair, if we were to toss morality aside, his plan worked. It's just that it back fired emotionally on everyone, that's the price of protecting Sunny from the law.
I call it bullshit. Involuntary manslaughter committed by a 12 year old kid, what they did in response is just illogical whether if they panicked or not. My guess is that Basil was already fucked in the head to come up with framing suicide.
Or you know, the themes about carrying on, the respectful separation of the painful memories from the good memories, the fact they are all actual children who would have no idea how to react to a situation like that and such a tragedy. I've seen my fair share of fucked up things in this life, and two kids who find themselves staring at the abyss and years of therapy might just actually band together to protect each other while they try to process it. This game is brilliant and I don't think you're going to be able to put yourself in the shoes of a kid whose experienced that.
Basil was there for a friend, i wouldnt say i'd do what Basil did, but i'd definitely help my best friend none the less
Yeah I say now I wouldn't do what Basil did, but I'm quite sure if I were younger I would- that is exactly a thought that would go through my head
Pretty sure Basil's been getting punches to the face for years now
Can you imagine if Basil died there?
The whole game I was expecting Basil to die or kill himself at any moment. I went for the good ending first though because I love basil he's very very cute. Haven't done the other routes/endings yet.
The ones that seem fragile, hopeless and precious in horror games always die first/early; if they don't, they're always hiding some heinous shit inside of their little heads.
God me too! Like the second we saw Basil in the first day I knew he wasn’t ok. I did get some of the other bad ending but at least I got the good one first above all.
Kel is definitely kind (or dumb, depending on how you see it) enough to forgive Sunny and Basil within a few days (or less-). Kel isn’t the kind of person to hurt any of them though. Hero would be really mad, from what we here from Kel, Hero was really hurt by Mari’s death, and learning this can make him snap (And I’m not sure if he’ll ever be able to forgive Sunnr or Basil) he also wouldn’t actively try to hurt either, that’s just not who he is. The only person who would (or could) hurt Sunny and Basil is Aubrey, but she almost got a taste for manslaughter after pushing Basil into the lake. I doubt any of them would *hurt* anyone, but I also have my doubts that they’d all forgive Sunny and Basil
That's what I said, Basil and Zunny forgive each other and themselves
serb basil?!
his real name is Vasily
3 words: Basil. Is. Coming. JUST KIDDING :) 
Can relate with basil, I also wanna >! Off!<. Myself
You good?

That is not a very effective spoiler tag
Do you happened to like a character called Leiner

I hope you're not fond of your skin Basil cuz that shit's coming off

Basil, we need to talk.
The LGBT communities worst enemy... the catholic church!
I appreciate that you make Basil look like the most tired person on the planet.
Ok honestly Sunny going "I'm gayer" Is accurate as hell. I may just be pushing my Autism onto him but him joking around like that seems like it would be his way of showing he accepts Basil for who he is (Also Basil laughing at it knowing this)
no offense but basil really is a closet made of glass
>!well I mean, in the true ending route based on what we see Sunny has confessed and gotten a huge burden off his chest, we also see basil smile at him implying that basil forgives him for telling everyone. What the other threes responses are is anyone’s guess!<
The scene has everything, bagel, suny, love and racism
Mari: So Basil, I don’t remember much since I had a head injury but what was that thing you said before I passed out about making it look like a suicide?. . Basil: 🫥
why does basil look so HAPPY
*In a house not far away from them*. . : Hey Basil, I'm back! I was just checking on-. . : ...Bunbun?. . : \[confused bunny noises\]
Bun bun: Hey Aubrey, something happened, and now I'm a human, and Basil is a bunny.
Someone will blend a Basil plushie, won't they.
Probably ):
I'll crush him in an elevator door

I'm gonna cover it in spiders 
I’m gonna rip his limbs off

No, but I will punt him daily, trying to get higher each time until finally, I can punt him to the moon. . I really want to punt Basil from Omori to the moon
You know what that means, theirs going to be a Basil plush.... . . . &#x200B;. . I'll buy your whole stock.
Leave one for me! 
Don't worry I'm poor, I'll sadly probably only be able to afford 1 
Haha… same…. . . I’m gonna bankrupt myself trying to get one plushy of each friend
No, Basil isn't the king, he's just a cassualty of battle
I saw somewhere that apparently basil is Russian?. . Idk if it's true and I guess that's still white but whatever 🤷
He is Serbian, that's why his parents are not present
If Basil had to grow up in the Balkans, it’s no wonder he suffers from crippling anxiety.
Basil grew up during the Yugoslav wars
Anxieties of his war crimes getting revealed to the world
Aw hell nah he's BaZil now
Beelzebub?

I know it's a tonal indicator (positive) but it's funny to me that someone who doesn't know might think you're saying "nerd / piece of shit"
Huh, I assumed piece of shit

I definitely thought they meant that and it made the comment wayyy funnier

You can say European to describe Basil because blonde hair isn't an American hair color . . If you use "white" it sounds kinda racist
I prefer Balkan with some Nordic Features. . so Eastern European
White just implies European decent, he's American but so is everyone else so it wouldnt make sense to write 'American' and there's 0 things in the game to point out his heritage so its just a guessing game lol
basil is a femboy, so he is Polish
Or Swedish
or slovakian
basil is not white basil is wattamelon
i am curious if basil is german

that's great for you
We can’t do the same mistakes that we done on post bagel day
I can't help this so I wanna speak my mind.. . &#x200B;. . >!For Kel it's obvious he enjoys Sunny's company, I mean he went out of his way to literally make him, MAKE him get out of the house, IIRC he tried to call him a couple times and even showed up to his house. Kel is charming in RW and shows alot of empathy to people, even when Aubrey was so distraught and changed, he still cared. That's just Kel. Kel has everyone's backs even when they don't want it.!<. . >!For Basil it's really a fanon thing I think, people believe Basil IS his best friend, and I agree to an extent, there's no denying Sunny WAS best friends with everyone. However Basil was overprotective, clingy (not his fault really) and borderline anxious around Sunny later in the game.!<. . >!As for kids they had that charm that they really a whole lot to eachother, you can tell the chemistry between them in RW even as kids, it's there, you can see it. Even in the photos Sunny allowed him and others to vent on himself. He didn't mind and he loved Basil (platonically ofc). I think Basil was a great friend but his overall personality change made him worse as a human being.!<. . &#x200B;. . These are my thoughts
His personality didn’t change, his anxiety just got extremely severe after the accident. Understandably so. They’re all very traumatized, none of them are really fundamentally bad as people. (Not that traumatized people can’t be bad people)
If I remember right, Sunny calls everyone his 'best friends' in the Memory Lane, and agreed with Basil's personality, there is almost no positive traits, poor guy.
>>!You didn't want to disappoint them. Because they were your friends!<. . >!There's some truth to this, I think it took him a while to truly understand and think them as HIS best friends, they WERE just friends, but the longer they were together the better it became for him. Although as I said there's truth to it!<
I wouldnt say its fanon to say sunny and basil were the closest. In his photo album Basil said that they started hanging out more and we just see them together alome a couple times after
Yeah I mightve worded it wrong. I don't necessarily believe what I wrote but just what most of the fandom thinks.. . Don't want to confuse you hehe 
Ok haha that makes sense
Basil was traumatised and had barely anyone to help him with the struggle. If i was traumatised i wouldn't come out either.
A nice and logical point of view, just as expected from you comentor...
İ mean so many others claim to be sunnys best friend as well İts a fanon thing that basil is the only one who gets the title,some people that proclaim to be his best friend is:. . -Basil . -Abbi "will you forgive me,my best friend". -Kel "yeah,we will be always best friends" ( i dont remember if that qoute meant the whole group or not if it dıd then the whole group gets the be his bestfriends)
Agreed about self proclaimed best friend, they were quite close, but that is just from Basil's perspective (Photo Album)... Sunny was probably close to everyone in the group (Basil was the last one to join, Kel the first, based on the Final Duet).
You left out some things about Basil-. . - Is very anxious but nice. - Reads books to you. - tells you about his plants. - vents to you and makes sure that’s okay. - comforts you when you need it. - will defend you no matter what, even at the cost of his own reputation. - suggests hanging your dead sister so you won’t be accused of murder(it’s actually manslaughter but what do they know, they’re 12)??. . Can we not, like, pick and choose who is ”better” among them? I know it’s a meme but people seem kinda serious about it.. Favourite characters is one thing but like none of us are mental health professionals here
THANK YOU. I’m a little uncomfortable with some of these comments here…
Like a horde used the chance to... you know.. . Yeah, i am 9 months late.
This is my first time on the sub after just completing the game. Am I missing something with the ending? How I interpreted it, Sunny and Basil decided on the hanging together. Basil probably only did the actual action because it's Sunny's sister. It's not like he just walked up to Sunny and immediately suggested staging a suicide. They were both panicked. Basil also was so traumatized that he was convinced some sort of monster killed Mari behind Sunny. Two twelve year olds just witnessed someone they both loved die in front of them. They are both overwhelmed with grief, shock, fear, and panic. They don't want lose all their other loved ones so they go with the staged suicide. It's irrational in hindsight, but it's pretty obvious that no one was in their right mind during that. I wouldn't be surprised if Basil or Sunny immediately regretted it, but didn't reverse it out of horror at seeing Mari's body again.. . All and all, I don't get why so many people seem to be putting all of the blame on Basil. He didn't do anything more than Sunny. If Sunny didn't agree to the staged suicide he would have stopped Basil. And honestly I really, really doubt that Basil came up with the idea at all, he's kind to everything and loves life.. . So am I missing something with the Basil hate on this sub?
Yeah I do agree with you on everything but the suicide staging idea part, I found this post on it:. . . [picture did not show up for some reason sp the post is in a reply]. . But it’s still not entirely Basil’s fault. He’s not evil or crazy or something just for somehow finding the idea of staging a suicide through some unknown source, he was 12 and panicking, like you said. He also obviously has some kind of anxiety and probably has PTSD from the event. They’re definitely both victims.. . And also this, a quote from someone else:. . ”l've even seen some ppl say that Basil quickly understanding that he had to make everything look like an accident was proof he was fully level-headed and of rational mind and like ?? no?? that's about one of the dumbest most panicky things you can do in that situation, no one thinking rationally would do that and it's more than enough proof that he was just as broken up about what happened as Sunny was.”

Ah, thanks for the picture. I didn't catch that. He did think of the idea, but like I said and you agreed with. They were both panicking. There's also the point that Sunny did agree to it, it's not like Basil did it secretly behind his back. So going through with it is still on both of them, not just Basil.. . I still find it kind of hard to believe Basil would actually suggest a staged suicide though. Maybe when Basil showed up they discussed ways to make it look like an accident and landed on that? I guess it kinda would make sense to go with suicide since she presumably died by breaking her neck.
Sounds like someone hasn’t heard of Basil nuke.
I mean in real life (duh) not Headspace. (Also, Kel's nuke is stronger and he can use it whenever you want, while Basil's hits everyone and is only usable in the boss rush.)
Basil has committed several acts of mass destruction after seemingly being on a "boss rush" in real life
i love how everyone ignores basils trauma, its really just the best  its like comparing a suicidal teenager to a social butterfly, oh wait..
yUp this comment section is so lovely 😍
I know this is all in good fun but the implications of "even when they were kids" is something I have a problem with in this formulation. Imo young BASIL is shown to be genuinely attentive to SUNNY's emotions, highly supportive, and it's pretty clear that they both choose to spend the most time together. We see memories showing BASIL talking with SUNNY frequently (and worrying that he's being overbearing, showing concern), showing him books which SUNNY later reads on his own initiative, SUNNY showing BASIL pet rocks, BASIL noticing SUNNY's crush and then keeping it a secret, BASIL coming up with the violin idea, BASIL setting up the chairs in MARI's room along with HERO so they can watch the two practice, the two wearing matching flowers in the duet sequence, the two spending a lot of time together after MARI gets busy with college prep, etc. And this might all seem a bit clingy on BASIL's part (there may be some truth to this tbh) but we are told repeatedly (by non-BASIL characters) that SUNNY hates being alone, so again I think this an example of closeness and understanding. Not that SUNNY has no one-on-one time with KEL, the examples there being sneaking out at night to hobbeez and running off during the flower crown memory, but I think it's pretty clearly shown that BASIL is very dear to SUNNY. Plus in headspace, BASIL gets his own house, color pallette, and SUNNY remembers verbatim his quotes about the flower meanings, while KEL kinda gets short shrift, being seen as hyperactive and literally annoying judging by his moveset. He does occasionally support OMORI in headspace, like in the hide and seek at the start, but I think BASIL is clearly given a lot of space in SUNNY's head rent free, >!even in the hikikomori route where the truth is disregarded.!<. . I think >! the incident !<is what really doomed that friendship to be seemingly nonexistent by game start, and at that point KEL deserves massive kudos for being there for SUNNY after all those years. They're clearly very close friends as well, but all I want to say is that BASIL was a genuinely good friend (if anything maybe a little too good during >!the incident!<) and the promise of healing that comes at the end shows that there is potential for "things to go back to the way they were before" to some degree.
1000% agree and many times more. Basil was really there for Sunny when he needed him. Their friendship is one of the most genuine ones soured by a tragic incident. My view is that Basil really wanted to help Sunny, but made it much worse instead, which is the guilt he carries and Sunny knows this, but is very conflicted about it due to what Basil had done, but would never forgive himself for leaving him behind, for he did the same as Basil.
That's a deep-ish look that makes sense.. . Kudos.
I think most people agree that kel is the better friend to sunny then basil, it just that basil was kinda forced to be friend after the “incidents”.
i do love basil to the moon and back and he is my favourite out of the main friend group, hell, even out of the entire CAST, but to be fully honest, i 100% agree with this post
mother fucker basil is traumatized
Yeah this take is not controversial at all, but the OP felt that this might contradict the consensus that Basil is Sunny's best friend, which is stated and proven in the game, but before that we need to defend our universally loved Kel:. . He only demonized Aubrey after she nearly killed Basil and before that yelled at him pretty maliciously. He showed in the first day outside a lot of understanding towards Aubrey, but worded things a bit too unempathetically which is why he was not able to reach her. Yes he does want things to be as they were before, but he isn't alone in this and all the others wished for the same thing. The difference is that Kel doesn't think too much about most stuff and can move on from one point to another far better than others, which makes him look like he moved on too quickly, when he is actually just as sad, but doesn't want it to tie him down. He did end up help Hero as he allowed him to see how much grief and worry he caused for others and with Aubrey he was thanks to Hero(who wouldn't be the same without Kel) able to mend their friendship. . . Back to Basil: He shows a lot more devotion and dedication to his relationships than anyone else in the story, which is why he made all the photos and even has  gone so far to protect Sunny, which would warrant in that sense the title as best friend. However I think the reason why Basil is Sunny's best friend, which I think is even shown in the game due to how many close moments they had in the story and understood and shared a lot of pain and trauma with one another to the point that they are almost of one mind. They even share similar clothing styles and Sunny fully remembers all of the flower meanings Basil gave to the flowers, showing how much he cares for Basil. . Basil is the best friend Sunny ever had and without him he cannot be happy at all. . . Speaking of which my unpopular opinion is that we get enough scenes with Sunny and Basi to conclude that they are best friends and for the role the flower boy played, he is shown in the game more than enough. . . Maybe they could show more of him, but I think we would have to wait for an update or a remaster for Omori. . . Anyway, this is my view on it.
Im sorry, I didn't mean to phrase it as a good thing that Basil covered up Mari's death. It was just a good example of how much Basil cared about Sunny.. . Basil saw Sunny was in shock (Basil was also prob not thinking straight), but noticed that Sunny caused Mari's death. He tried to cover it up to make sure Sunny didn't get blamed, shiftung some of the blame on himself. That's disturbing, but pretty selfless when he he could have been absolved of blame if he just told the truth.. . Also, it wasn't because of Basil or his actions that the group drifted apart. It was because Mari, which held the group together through her picnics and personality, had died. It would have been the same in any case, no matter how she died. Meeting together with any of the friend group would have brought back the pain of knowing Mari is gone, and thats why the only people who were still on good terms were Kel and Hero, literal brothers who couldn't avoid each other and only bonded together again after a year.. . Basil made mistakes and caused Sunny's guilt to worsen as a byproduct of trying to 'save' him from being the cause of Mari's death. Even to the point of believing that 'something behind him' did it instead of him.
SOMETHING was created by Basil and inflicted onto Sunny I believe.. . SOMETHING is the personification of the guilt and shame of Sunny's actions but since Basil was involved it latched onto him as a fear
thank you for putting this to words, people really do  ignore basil's 135 unchecked mental illnesses and blame him personally for them
Omori fans when you ask them to have literally any grasp of nuance:. . I'm aware this post is a joke, but just wanted to offer some thoughts. I see a lot of Kel fans say shit like "He's so healthy" or whatever, seeing him as nothing more than the nice guy who got Sunny out of the house, unironically believing he's flawless, acting like him having a romantic relationship with Sunny would go perfectly, etc. Kel is clearly not a healthy person, even if he's coped better than his other friends, and tbh, I think people missed the point if they think that. He's less visibly unhealthy than Basil or Sunny, but he is still in dire need of therapy.. . That aside, everyone's actions are easily explainable with a little thought, and Sunny still dreams of Basil in more significant ways than Kel (saving Basil, his Jesus like status, appearance before everyone else in memory lane after he *stabs* Sunny, memorizing his plant facts and bedroom layout, memorizing the distance to his house if not necessarily the route as seen in Headspace), and even comes outside for the express purpose of saving Basil, as evidenced by the fact that he sees Basil before waking up and leaving the house in the Sunny room, having spent years consumed by guilt because he knew Basil well enough to form the Stranger and be aware of how shitty Basil's life would be without him.. . That wasn't directed at you, OP, just something I wanted to say in general, because these things have annoyed me within the fandom.. . TL;DR (it's like 10 sentences, though) Kel fans act like he's healthy and flawless when he's not/Basil is clearly Sunny's best friend. . Probably going to get downvoted for an unpopular opinion but w/e lol
Yeah people really don't seem to notice just how important Basil is to Sunny. He's made to be incredibly special in Sunny's dreams, notice how he's the only one other than Omori not to have the same colour pallette as the rest of the gang. As you mentioned, he memorized so much of what Basil told him. And in the end, Basil being in danger is what finally pushed Sunny to facing the truth.. . He lost an eye yet he still manages to give Basil a big smile. I'd go as far as saying, there's nobody alive Sunny cares more for than Basil.
How is basil even a friend at this point (please don't get mad at me I'm just saying my opinion)
he has trauma, i think if he was in other circunstances, he will be different
Yeah, people who hate him seem too forget that he lived through traumatic experiences and he has basically no parents. Polly is the only one who really cares for him and that's sad. I dont count grandma since she is in hospital
Your right hmmmm
I guess your right 🤔
I actually found a way to nuke with basil in the party :p. . Make omori manic and basil happy of some sort. Then use cheer. . . Omoris speed increase let's him use vertigo super effectively reaching heights the Kel nuke can only dream of
Basil is adorable though :3
On the one hand, Basil's personality matches more with Sunny's.. . On the other, Basil >!fuckin' gouged his eye out.!<. . So yeah, I think it's fair to say that Kel is a bit better friend.
Basil: Flower boy. Kel: Not Flower boy. Basil is superior
I don't think that's an unpopular opinion tbh, I think everyone knows Kel is way better then Basil (I love Basil).
I fucking hate this so much for one thing Basil did try to get sunny outside it’s implied on the hikiomori route and second basil is a good friend he’s not in the best place mentally it’s like comparing a serverly mentally I’ll teenager to a mentally stable person
Also another thing is that Basil obviously really cares for sunny and will do anything to keep him safe and out of blame and overall try’s to help him out alot
at this point it's known facts that basil is a dum dum
As much as I love him, he ain’t the smartest tool in the garden shed.
Wait, Basil didn't apologize?. . Does >!the scene after their fight where he apologizes to you outside your house!< not count? I think it should.
I like Basil better as a character because there’s so much in him to look into, but Kel would be a way better best friend than Basil.
Basil is the worst (affectionate). I spent the entire game examining, emphasizing, and learning about Sunny's torment, sorrow, and anguish, only to be smacked in the face with Basil having a worse grip on reality and somehow, a worse sense of accountability. After freshly overcoming his own trauma, Sunny has to run to save Basil from killing himself.
This is a really weird point to make ngl and I hate that it's using Basil's trauma to prove something...I hope whoever made this post is really young and doesn't understand how life and emotions work, because I would be definitely disappointed if it was an adult whose brain is supposed to be fully developed. Either that or it's a joke.. . Kel is my favorite character and I think he's an amazing friend to Sunny, but you can't compare a guy who has been traumatized by literally watching Sunny kill his own sister and a guy who has way better social skills and not even half the trauma Basil is going through. Let's not use Basil's sufference against him...how could he even knock on Sunny's door after all that happened? Kel had all the incentives to knock on that door...Basil didn't.. . Basil is literally malnurished, while Kel is a strong and fast teenager doing sports...not a flex (no pun intended). . Again, Kel CAN be there for Sunny because his mind isn't effed up, while Basil CAN'T for very obvious reasons. . Basil has apologized plenty of times lmao the whole game he's out there literally blaming himself for what happened even when it was Sunny who killed Mari.. . "He thinks there's something behind you for whatever reason" I'm starting to think this is a joke, not a funny one though, not even gonna comment on this one.... . "Accuses you of betrayal for moving away" RIGHTEOUSLY SO (in some way)...Sunny literally left him during a panic attack, he basically could have died in there. Plus it might not be his fault inherently, but he never wanted to confront Basil about what happened in the past, so Basil thought he hated him.. . I guess Reddit is gonna Reddit...I'm just gonna pretend you're trolling.
i think i get why people hate basil now
But Basil is a cinnamon roll. . edit: I guess jokes aren’t allowed here
Basil sucks😡😡😡
Basil flair detected, opinion denied >!(/s)!<
And this is why i said it and will say it again.. I FUCKING HATE BASIL. BASIL SHOULD FUCKING DIE AND ROT IN HELL.
Kinda cringe ngl

It has appear no other basil haters are here 😔😔
I think it's less Basil being your friend and you having to be the best friend to Basil.
that's why i hate basil
Headspace facts VS Real world facts hold a MUCH different weight from one another. One is their actual behavior. The other is Sunny/Omori's perspective on them. There's also a handful of points I don't quiiite agree with.. . > Only appears during 5% of the game. . That has to do with Omori suppressing the memory of Basil, since it also reminds him of the traumatic event. Basil is also upset during the Real World encounters, since.... . > Accuses you of betrayal for moving away. . This one is a little iffy. Right after the traumatic event, Basil makes Sunny promise that they'll be there for each other, no matter what. It's the opening cutscene of the game and establishes their current relationship. It's not "betrayal", it's the breaking of a promise.. . > He thinks there is something behind you for whatever reason. . Sunny's trauma comes from the accidental involvement with the traumatic event. His "Something" manifests as the direct result of his mistakes. Basil's, on the other hand, comes from thinking his best friend intentionally caused the traumatic event. That's why he thinks there's "something behind you". While your trauma is connected to Mari, Basil's is connected to Sunny.. . **but yeah Kel is 1,000% the better pal**
Left of Basil's left wing
It's technically his right wing

Fucking spoilers
bruuuh. . sorry

just don't go on this sub until you finish the game
Or, get this, you could mark your spoilers before posting them. You know, like the rules says you should.
Spoiler this, maybe?
lil Basil boy is my angel
Bagel 🥺
Basil ❤o❤
Omg angel basil is so fucking cool
*hoi4 ost axis theme plays* oh no U MADE BASIL FASCIST NOOOOO!!!!
Uncle Basil stabbed me
"To be fair, I did kinda stab him first"
I thought Sunny just beat the crap out of Basil and sent him to the hospital
I remember writing a scene in my fic where Sunny and Basil or maybe it was Basil and Aubrey played Clue but I had to play Clue all by myself to make sure the moves they made actually made sense xD that would be so neat
You should have called me, I love Clue
Like, it's not needed, but a Basil Spin-Off could work. Especially since he has the screen time of like, a couple minutes.
Anime? new spinoff? Basil's hairstyle seems different...
its awesome 😭 i imagine basil trying to catch her and then proceeding to get squashed
Probably sneaking out. Sunny's just trying to act normal while Kel is on the lookout and Basil is ready to catch her. But Aubrey isn't looking at Basil which probably means she wants Kel or Sunny to catch her instead because Basil wouldn't be strong enough 
little off topic but basil ready to catch her is so adorable. not in a ship way but in a genuinely adorable kid moment 
Shame what their relationship turns into

But it's the opposite of fun messing with Basil. Draw every character on this image telling him everything is gonna be ok while crossdressing, they're way cooler than the gang that neglects and drowns him, I don't care if the vampire nazi robots are here/hj
Why are the pink butch lebsbiabs calling the bagel and the goat gay, are they hypostasises?

Really any answer is a spoiler but there are multiple endings. 
ffffuuuuu-
Please, OP, for the sake of your very first playthrough and the emotional impact it will have on you, mute this subreddit for a while. You WILL get spoilers, and Basil is a super important character.
 fellow basil appreciator
Yeah this post definitely makes me feel like something's terrible is gonna happen to Basil lol
I have. And now I have a lot of questions
I had a hunch since the beginning something was off with her since she wasnt part of the party that went to look for Basil. So I was mentally prepared when I learned lol
Nice I guess (I don’t know how to react to someone who just found out someone’s dead)
I Love basil omg hiiii
He is, in fact, baby. Also, I'd be careful reading comments here, as someone who's played the game inside and out on Steam since it's release, people like to spoil things.. . Don't worry. The Basil you currently know will be just fine. 
>!Narrator: But something DID happen to Basil.!<
“This is a story of a boy named basil”
Basil is absolutely precious
 i also like basil!!!
How about you all leave them alone if you hate Basil.. Just Ignore them, be civil guys. I'm not really that interested in Basil, but It's annoying. Also comments that say "I'd be happy without Basil","I'd punt Basil into space", How original. If you think I'm mad, I'm not. Just annoyed. 50% of this community is worse than the school in HC2
YEE ONE MORE FOR THE BASIL FANCLUB

i beat the game and I love basil so much. i want him to be happy and healthy
Basil best character in both Character and in Visual Character Design
I think Basil and Aubrey have a lot in common to Mahiru and Pekoyama. . Spoilers from Danganronpa 2. . >!Basil loves Photos, so does Mahiru!<. . >!Basil has relation to the death of someone's sister, so does Mahiru!<. . >!Basil got killed using a bat, so does Mahiru!<. . >!The person that killed Basil is in love with the dead sister's brother (Dream Aubrey is in love with Omori/Sunny), so does the person that killed Mahiru!<. . >!Basil got killed due to that relation with de death of someone's sister, so does Mahiru!<. . >!Basil's death was not real, Mahiru's death "either"!<
Actually, this mirror event happens after the piano scene and if you look in the mirror at night after you >!leave Basil to die!<.
This guy is fucking awesome. I LOVE how he’ll just stop dead in the middle and whip out a whiteboard and discuss what he thinks is going on psychologically with the characters for like 20 min. . My favorite was his immediate “oh that’s not good” upon basil giving you the photo album.. . My only gripe is that because he does so much (really good) analysis his play-through is really slow.
He's one of maybe like three people I've EVER seen twig that Basil giving away the photo album before he even knows about Sunny moving is Bad Fucking News
Oh I knew that right away. . . I’ve had a friend who tried to self exit and had others with self harm issues who I watched for stuff like that like a hawk. . . Basically the entire game I was like “HELP HIMMMMMMMMM”
Kill themselves. Just *say* they tried to take their own life. Don't censor serious topics.
My friend actually really prefers people describe it that way and I’ll respect her wishes. . . It’s her attempt, I’ll describe it how she wants others to describe it
..."self exit" sure sound like the right level of seriousness to talk about a friend's attempting to take their lives...
Actually how she prefers people talk about it
do you remember the other two?
my favourite part was when he saw white space and immediately went "yeah this kid is depressed"
I love how blunt he is
>My only gripe is that because he does so much (really good) analysis his play-through is really slow.. . ..And we love him for it 😭 My first playthrough of his was with Mouthwashing, and it's funny how a 2-3 hour game turned into a 5 episode playthrough that are 40 mins to an hour with just how MUCH he talks about the psychological stuff. Very much don't watch him just for the usual playthrough of any game, so the slow progress doesn't bother me since a major part of it IS on dissection of it.
Actually yeah, I skip through a lot of gameplay stuff and non story stuff to get his in depth thoughts on things.
How do you do that line thing?????
If you're on a browser, the double quotation mark toggles the quote block.. . 
Yep pretty much. I actually found him from his Mouthwashing gameplay too!!
He acknowledged the photo album?! I thought I was the only one that picked up on that being a red flag! 😭 I have to watch his playthrough. I don't mind it being slow, I love character analysis.
Oh yeah, I knew that right away.
Oh damn I actually want to watch his videos about it now.
You should. If you don’t wanna watch the gameplay just skip to story moments or until you see him whip a blackboard out on screen
My favorite bit is in the first episode where he goes  "stab what? Stab WHO???" 
Can you give me other examples from his playthrough?
>!OMORI!<. . >!psssh... mari lovd her... kid!<. . >!bio: omori was born with a special power. he was stronger than all his friends in the headspace fighting academy. he served in the headspace military fighting basil and in the final battel against basil they were fighting and basil turned him to the darkness and omori turned against mari and killed her. he lost a part of his sanity in the battle which is why he doesnt not have a part of his sanity, pls stop PMing me askin me why thats why. also socks arent gurly fuck you khaoskid663 everyone knos your a fuckin pokemon scammer!<. . >!likes: hurtin people, bein badass, motorcycles, nine inch nails (the band), killing, death, punk rock, striped shorts, skulls, darkness, ninne inch nails (on finger), earings, black(cool kind not gay kind)!<. . >!dislikse: niceness, happiness, levis, basil from school fuck you basil stop showin everyone my fuckin deviantart you peace of shit, trent razner, short nails, khaoskid663, sunshine, life, my dad, football!<. . >!©sunny\suzuki84!<

huh
Yeah.. wtf
it was a coldsteel reference
it was a frozeniron reference
New copypasta just dropped
Holy spaghetti!

Tbh Omori is ***THE*** most overhated character.. . Even more so than Basil.
I have a hard time understanding the hate for either of them considering the necessary progression through the entire story.
....He literally tries to get Sunny to kill himself and is the literal embodiment of his self-hatred and his unhealthy coping mechanisms. How is he overhated? (I'm talking about Omori, not Basil. Basil is precious. )
wellllll... >!basil can reach tier 3 emotions too in the console exclusive boss rush!<
I agree with this assessment as well.. . Another connection I'm making is how a lot of Basil's character seems to be molded by the absence of his parents.. . Even at the beginning of the game during the picnic, Basil says he likes to "disappear" behind the camera. This might imply he likes taking candid pictures but I think it's more about not wanting to he the center of attention.. . His attitude of trying to always face the sun, see the good in everyone is also a clue that he might have been rationalizing his parents abandonment so much that it just became his normal way of thinking. Kids will do unbelievable rationalization of traumatic stuff their parents put them through because it is incredibly hard to accept the truth - that they don't love you and don't care about you.
quiet young introvert = autistic ?. . tbh basil seems a lot more autistic coded to me
Yea lol, to me he was always just a selective muted introvert tho I just wanted more thoughts about it
Anyway, yes he is 100% autistic coded (maybe it's not canon, like how Basil is queer coded but not canonically queer!)
They started making Cream Filled Bagel jokes
I didn’t even notice Basil at first
smothered
Holy hell
Smothered mate reference
I only noticed basil after reading your comment and even then it took me a minute to find him he's a tiny little guy
He was consumed
I just feel sad for Basil here
He looks like he's been tied to the tree
Black space basil art and something else are honorable mentions, but this is fascinating. . . . Who do you think gave the headspace cast their own merchandise, and how?
The something else in question:. . . . (Excuse the self-reply)
this one is very cute, their personalities and darker sides😏
That looks so terrifying. The artist did a great job, a brilliant one!

woah, this is incredible
this has so much meme potential. . >!Hero: "Basil why did you not try to catch Mari as she was falling instead of just watching?"!<. . >!Basil: !<. . 
. . Found this on the basil cult subreddit and have been waiting for an opportunity to use it
Angel Basil is too precious, we must protect him at all costs
The image of Basil in the neutral ending
Why tho? 
Not OP, but I actually think it's very well done aesthetically >!even if the subject matter makes it pretty offputting!<
that’s cool, could you elaborate?
Not really. I'm not very good at turning my thoughts into actual words when it comes to art, unfortunately.
that’s fine, I have the same problem haha
Look at my username

. . Basil <3 
this one's mine as well!! basil's hair is so fluffyyyy..
This game is Amazing! It definitely SHOULD be a series.. or at least make a few movies! Omori is a really important game (if you play seriously, with only the dead truth in your decisions and actions. ) I  played it with my Son with both of us having mostly the same answers to questions.. we made sure to water Basil's flowers every time we remembered and we got the really good ending where you and Sonny go to the hospital and basil is awake and you saved him! And I kid you not, it was so amazing that not only me but my son and I both busted out crying!.. because it was like an emotional release that Basil was okay, everything got straightened out and it made us feel good because we were truthfully answering the questions and doing what we truly would have done if really in that situation. My son did this with me when he was 17 and to this day (he's 23 now) he and I still talk about our game of Omori ❤
This Basil fanart.. . 
Basil*
Basil becomes the first Dendro character
omori is the new geo meta character

The difference is Basil actually felt bad
That hat is something that Basil would wear
Ma boi Basil doesnt deserve this :(
They're white....They're blonde... They're the same people!
i think the joke for basil is >!that they both have something to do with hanging bodies!<
Logan Paul as Basil is extremely fitting
WT*?! Logan Paul as Basil?!!
i mean >!they both have something to do with hanging bodies!<
oui... c'est vrai...
Why does basil look like shit?
I'll hunt you down for comparing Basil to Logan Paul
Lost the opportunity to make basil donald trump
THE BASIL LOGAN PAUL ONE IS EVIL
I was gonna say to not do my boy basil like that, but now that i think about It they both have something in common yeah...
New headcanon: basil's dad is batman. That's why he's not around.
If Basil isn't casted as some femboy I will personally push myself down the stairs. .   . also every character should be Kamala Harris I agree
the virgin femboy basil vs the chad twink basil
oh my god you're a genius
How am i only finding out today that basil has a father
"You're such a joker. Basil, I'm glad you visit me every week. "
I love you, grandma.
Stuff: This is so wholesome
W e    l i v e   i n    a    S o c i e t y
personally i think that her death would have been emphasized more and lead to basil doing worse things
Close
wdym
it could be her dying and that pushing basil over the edge
That’s what did end up happening
"OYASU-"
Omocat said that back then the game was more about basil and his situation with his grandma being sick rather than being about Mari who didn’t exist at the time. She also said that he wasn’t called basil back then either and parts of the game would take place at the school too. It was scrapped early on because they found that people didn’t really care about basils grandma. Just saying all this from my memory of the stream since I don’t think they are archived I could’ve gotten some stuff wrong. . . The stream is from basils birthday if anyone was wondering. . Edit: omocat also noted that before basil became the cinnamon bun we know today he also used to be pretty edgy. . . Edit 2: if I remember correctly the kid sitting by himself in this [old art]() is his original design
>because they found that people didn’t really care about basils grandma. . . 💀
As funny as it seems it’s true though. I know for sure that I wouldn’t like the game as much if it was about helping some angsty teen get over having a sick grandma
First of all, Mari has existed ever since the Graphic Novel days (her earliest documented appearance at least so it could be even earlier), so that kind of shoots a hole in that. Second of all, I don't think OMOCAT ever said the game was ever moreso about on Basil and his grandma rather than Mari, nor that the reason Basil's grandma was relegated to a different role was because people didn't care about her. Also, if this was said, it would be a more well documented thing in the fandom.. . The info about Basil's personality (Rowan) and his OG design (Flower) is correct, however.. . By the way, the stream was re-uploaded [here](), although the beginning is missing, though according to the poster nothing too important happened.
Well it goes it kinda goes full circle with the hikki/Omari au with basil being depicted as an edgy boy
She'd probably give more information about Basil and give him more screentime.
Providing basil lore
Being emotional support to Basil and has a similar backstory to him and Sunny. Probably says the cliche "don't repeat my mistake" line said by the wise old person who helps the main character for character development in some movies/shows. Will help basil get rid of his guilt and all that stuff.. . But idk there could be more to it than just that
BASIL'S GRANDMA IS NESS
>!probably to add weight to basil. Since in the normal game his grandma is dead and that adds to him wanting to commit su- i mean, unlife, i think the original concept couldve been that she dies while hanging out with the gang and gets the news. That wouldve been horrible.!<
Judging by the image, probably emotional support for Basil and Sunny (basically give you advice and information about your current situation) or she would tell you information about how Basil really feels at times.
Hmm... I don't think Basil would tell her the truth because he would want to keep that hidden away as much as possible, even from people he trusts.  . I think the role Basil's grandmother played would be Similar to Mari's in Headspace. She would give Basil advice (Mari for quests), dote on him and try to push him to realise what he must do to fix his mistakes (while ultimately being ignorant to what truly happened). In game, Basil seems to lack the kind of encouraging force that headspace Mari gives to Omori (and by extension Sunny) and that's why he seems so afraid to confront Sunny and friends. I think Basil's grandmother would have provided that encouragement and pushed Basil to make up with his friends but that role was cut short so Basil ends up not reconnecting with his friends the same way Sunny does.
I think Basil’s grandma helped him with his guilt; she could have helped Basil to face his guilt and persuade Omori to end it.
Basils depression
Mostly as a main motivating force for Basil to come out and help him deal with what he has done. . . Maybe with the leaks hinting at a more Basil-centered route, we will get to see her in the real world and we also get her to help Sunny with his issues. . . That's my assumption, though I think Omocat can answer it better, she made the game after all.
She obviously was like a parental figure to Basil. She taught him about flowers and such but other than that i don't want to make weird guesses
Grandma finds out the truth. Basil has to put her down. . . We never did see her again after one day left...
basils therapist
Spank basil
In the demo, only available if you were in the kickstarter, basil’s grandma came to omori’s dreams to look for basil
grandma kills basil
Potentially Basil's grandma's death could have been the inciting incident for basil and omori is the one that tells sunny what to do with mari
Honestly, I think her analogue in the dreaming was the Tree at the end of Humphrey's area. That it's implied that Basil told her the truth because he was unable to bear the truth on his own. That regardless of still loving him, he still felt guilt even telling her, giving her that burden. The tree let's the dreamer Omori closer to the truth of what happened, but starts him on the path of self-forgiveness in the act of taking the fruit. However, in doing so, kills the tree. This kills the grandmother irl but is a necessary step in the good ending. Rejecting the tree sends Sunny down the bad ending, he never starts his journey of self acceptance, and Basil never had the catalyst that made him start his own journey through the admission that it is just too much to bear now.
there will be new route in the switch version (friend bosses, playable BASIL)
I hope we get a pov switch to basil during the events of the game, although seeing the leaked files titled "simulation" kind of worry me a bit as we might just get it as side content rather than a primary addition to the main game
PS4 too or only on sw?
i think on ps4 too. not too sure.
Nothing is confirmed, we literally don't know if it's even exclusive content.
hehe...basil content...though i have it on pc..everything for basil
pleaseee please basil route  plspls
Orange joe is banned in headspace. It is only available in >!black space!< (that's what >!Basil!< was feeding on to survive)
: Basil we need to cook
I’m doomed, no way I’m going to be able to convince my parents to let me get another one, especially after just preordering Basil’s popup Parade 😭
I need a Basil plushh!!!
Im going to go feral i need rw basil plush now
I will fucking kill someone if Basil doesn’t exist.
I need the Basil one so I can have both
I need basil plush...
YAYYY!! IM DEFINITELY GONNA GET THE BASIL PLUSH >:\]
Gotta know what the basil irl plushie looks like since I'm ordering one of the plushies
Get the fuck up Basil, we got a city to burn
. . can we get a super in depth translation of what each character means.. . I've already noticed it's different than the characters used above OMORI in the issue that revealed the release date (which is オモリ, which is pronounced OMORI but according to google translate atleast means "weight" which could have alot of connotations ranging from >!the figurative weight of the Truth!< to Basil calling OMORI bulbous.)
Sanest Basil fan
Literally the only difference is that Basil’s vest is green and his shorts are lighter than Sunnuy
Yee, I wonder if this was intentional
Basil's the tallest. . Source: me 
OMG, the real Omori told us who's the tallest
That moment when you're shorter than all of them
Bulli the shortie
No, just a joke
fumo
so basically, Basil is really ^smol
Little scrunkly
This is so incorrect!. . . . . . BASIL is 12791628'3
Basil the giant
Exactly! 
He's a tall boi
He's as tall as the ladder to otherworld
Headspace gang just climbs him instead
I wanna be Bagel height
Don't we all?
Wait how tall is Bagel?
I'm not sure
Just looked. 5’6”. I’m two inches off
Pog
Rumor has it your height is affected by your true love disappearing. By this logic, Basil should be the tallest /j
Oh no, it's actually the opposite until Sunny comes back, then Basil becomes the tallest /j
Wait has Basil always had Omori’s outfit? Maybe Basil wears the outfit as a way to be close to Omiri?
Basil has always worn that in game, and he wouldn't know what Sunny was wearing when they hadn't seen each other in 3 to 4 years.
basil be looking like a good breakfast
Snacc
OK I want basil
I’m getting that Bagel! 
It's going to be expensive I bet... but I need aubey and basil.
I'm going to buy basil :)
BASIL!!’nnnn CZITÝKGÝRŚURQURyojfyigjjgsgjajaritaufFnchff
 yay I want Basil ❤❤
Basil got the fertilizer fumes radiating his muscles
I think that's cancer....
Basil we need to cook
Extra damage+
Doesn't matter, cancer damage is still damage to the enemy
Surprisingly, I Headcanon Basil to be one of the stronger members of the group. Gardening is not a hobby for weak people because there's so mush lifting involved. Even before >!the incident!< happened, Basil probably was used to lugging around bags of soil, fertilizer, and lots of pots of plants, considered how many of those are at his house. And considering that he canonically was gardening more around the events of the game to relieve stress (tho simultaneously not taking care of the plants, which makes sense due to the depressive thoughts mounting in his mind), he was probably doing more lifting at the time. . . The only reason people think he's the weakest member in the group is because he's not a fighter. He can't bear to fight back against Aubrey, knowing the past their had as being each other's first best friends. >!We only see him fight at one part in the Sunny route, and three parts ofnthe game as a whole if we include Stranger Basil and Boss Rush on console.!<
Yeah uh... no. Check the mid-fight dialogue. [Enemy)](). . It's kind of implied Basil was trying to pull a murder-suicide.
Damn, I think you’re right. I don’t think it’d be difficult for Basil to lift her up, because I think he used the jump rope as a pulley
Well, yes, but the body is still VERY heavy even if you have a lever. I can bet that unless you're a gym addict, you won't be able to pull a body like that.
I’d arguably put Basil after Sunny. . >!Sunny managed to beat Basil with just his hands while Basil needed shears to do the job. Plus, he defeated Aubrey which Basil cannot do!<
he beat the shit out of basil so bad he had to be hospitalized, and basil had a bladed weapon, sunny is the true mvp here
basil gardens
basil at least does gardening. i think he got some muscle on him, he just too timid to use any of it. placed right tho.
Basil just like me fr in literally every aspect of his character except… well
Basil is stronger than ppl make him out to be. Its just that the others are stronger
Sunny is stronger than Basil since you canonically beat them. You may have a knife but Basil has full on sheers.
>!bro sunny put basil into the hospital with his fucking fists, hes stronger than basil atleast!<
Basil would kill me
Sunny managed to hospitalize Basil with his bare hands. I say he goes above Basil.
I got a feeling that Basil flair isn’t just because of omori
Check my profile banner lol
Well, both Byzantine history and Omori have a fairly important Basil in them 
>!But then Basil brought her back up again!<
And flowers!
Sometimes he even loves pushing up daisies!
>!Tulips get the garden shears though!<

God damnit this fandom, lol
come on come on move
i think you can keep exploring after getting the last key if you just don't go to basil's house but you could also try that just in case
OH GOD IF THERE'S A BASIL PLUSHIE I'M DEFINITELY SELLING A LUNG AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE SURE I CAN AFFORD IT
If there’s a basil plushie I will buy it just to set it on fire
I just know several people are gonna buy a basil plush, and just freaking dismbowl it
im in the list
We need to start a second Basil war then 
I hope there's gonna be a Basil plushie.
SPOILERS: Basil does a hit and run and dies accidentally driving his car into a tree
Bro wth, why did you spoil it
YOU- OH COME ON YOU SCUMBAG
WHY
Bruh, it was the best moment here!
Wat
kinda hate omocat for leaving the ending open-end, now we are never going to know if basil grew into a watermelon, a basil plant or an eggplant 
Yeah I really wanted to know
UPDATE 3:  . got to basil's house, what is that thingy. he was in the notebook in white space as well
UPDATE 4:. . made it to otherworld! ill keep playing tomorrow.
No offense but do you not mind spoilers? Seems like you're tryna get as much interaction with the sub as possible despite not being anywhere near the end of the game and having a lot of the discovery made less impactful because of all these spoilerish comments, not tryna be mean or anything I'm just curious cuz I just don't  really understand wanting to engage in a community you don't really understand yet
I just replied to the first few comments, I don’t rlly check the sub much and I haven’t had much other interaction besides this, haven’t seen anything spoilers so dw
Update 12:. basil no what the fuck
Update 13:. Had to fight a thing on the stairs.. Who was that girl tho?! I feel like I know tho
How does it foreshadow that?? You just said >!she picks on Kel, not on Basil, so if anything I’d expect her to bully Kel and leave Basil alone instead!< . . Oh wait you mean >!just the fact that she turns out as a bully, not necessarily that she bullies Basil specifically!<?
Finish the game first and then come here. This sub is about >!forfeiting all our material possessions to basil!< which may be quite confusing if you haven't finished the game first
Yeah,you're gonna lose your mental sanity in order to find Basil
and the scent of basil!
And the scent of >!A Violinist falling off a hospital building that could easily beat the Burj Khalifa in height!!<
Why are you so scared Basil? 
(.\.Uu)
he rembered something probably 
oh no, everyone protecc the bagel!
Real world basil. So stupid, he doesn't even have a flower crown.
RW Basil
I have to say my fav is basil. He is so warm, sweet, kind, precious, and just everything to me. I almost cried (or did) whenever he takes you thru his garden & tells you each flower that reminds him of his friends. He’s so soft I can’t 🤧

Counter argument: basils name is his taste
Counter point Basil goes on pasta
I’ve been bested 

No,basil go in blender 
Basil Pesto 
Counter point pesto is made out of basil
Point
Counter counter point >!Babil is watermelon!<
I disagree. Basil tastes like watermelons
basil's hair looks like spagghetti
Basil hair looks like a lemon
what kind of lemons have you been eating because that colour is light yellow
[This]() one (actually I'm not eating any lemon lately) and if you didn't  realized yet look at [this]() and [this]()
Basil, should taste like pesto sauce.
Wait ...basil tastes like watermelon 😶
Basil tastes like watermelon
Basil tastes like watermelon
Why is Basil pasta with tomato sauce and not pasta with pesto sauce ? . . I mean pesto contains basil, does it not ?
Ur telling me basil doesn’t taste like watermelon?
Basil tastes like pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese
Basil tasted like pesto. I tried.
Basil taste like guilt and salt or salty watermelon
SUNNY taste like MICROWAVED STEAK. . AUBREY taste like GRILLED EGGPLANT. . KEL taste like ORANGE JOE and BURGERS ON MY MIND. . HERO tastes like TOMATO and LETTUCE. . MARI taste like CRISPY CHOCOLATE COOKIES . . BASIL taste like BASIL with SALAD
LOL I hate both basil and everything with tomatos so this is accurate.
Basil's gotta taste like watermelon
No. Basil tastes like some mint dessert
>! I thought Basil was the one that put her on the pedestal!<
With basil I think him looking as young as he does makes the ending hit way harder
how come?
It makes basil look innocent and untouched by stress
yeah i noticed omori lets mari get away with a lot more than basil? i forget when but he lets her finish speaking about the truth before warping to white space but basil couldn't even say 2 words in the prologue lmfao
Once you >!reach the part in Humphrey where everyone starts to forget about Basil, Basil disappear as a quest once you ask her for help. (Good think I thought to check that)!<
>!i remember genuinely thinking "i feel like something is missing here" when i went to check with her!<
Basil disappears from the purple background
Those sirens are for Basil silly
But we haven't even met the real Basil in the hikkikomori route, how would we know the sirens are meant for someone else other than Sunny, especially since we end up leaving the town, too 
Well, the moving out ending is not exclusive to the hikkikomori route for one, and whether or not we've met Basil doesn't change whether or not he dies afaik. Unless you're just joking around cause I'm incapable of discerning such things :p
No I'm not joking, though initially I was trying to be uhhhhh playful or whatever, I'm just bad at guaging (is that how you spell that???) reactions so I was making sure /notmad /genuine. . Anyway, personally I think it's wild to think that identical endings with Something falling you out to the car and then sirens playing in the credits on one of the neutral and one of the hikkikomori endings have the sirens happening for different reasons, cause we know for sure the sirens are cause of Basil in the neutral version of that ending so why would an otherwise completely identical ending have them for a different reason, but to be fair Sunny's lack of interaction with irl Basil in that route might give Basil less of a reason to kill himself that day, though based off Basil's comment on seeing Sunny for a short while before knowing he was moving out in the Sunny route I think we know he was already planning on ending it, so I really don't think we have any reason to think the sirens wouldn't be about him in a Hikikomori route. Sunny being clueless here I don't think changes that Basil does it and his caretaker calls the police/ambulance causing sirens that day.
Well, one thing's for sure; nobody was happy in the hikkikomori route!
Just gonna add, Basil’s death is not specifically just Sunny. It’s heavily implied Basil’s grandma dies the day the rest of the gang get back together. Her illness is a shadow over everything else, and she’s the one who Basil has the White Egret for. Sunny and the gang are actually kinda looking after Basil that night, though except for Sunny and maybe Hero they don’t know about Basil’s grandma.
I don't think it would be placed fully on Basil in honesty... They both did the hanging so it's on both of them. And another thing, I think Basil gets a lot of hate and it's unfair XD. Like all he was trying to do was help his friend, they were both scared. And Basil as a loyal friend wanted to help his friend not get into any trouble. Sunny's story is tragic yes, being haunted by what he had done and suppressing it by the creation of Omori. . . But (In my opinion at least)Basil's is also pretty tragic. We don't really know things from his point of view, something happened to his parents is all we can really glean, and he only had his grandma. Eventually his grandma's health took a bad turn, and a caretaker had to come into the picture. So here we have a childless boy who is basically watching his grandma dying on a daily. He assumes his friends have just left him since Sunny never visits, he's pretty clingy and doesn't want someone to leave him that's pretty much normal for someone who is lonely like that... It doesn't get any better when Aubrey and her goons freaking beat him up basically on a daily and call him names and then steal from him. (Aubrey uses the 'I'm protecting them' thing but that's no excuse to take someone else's stuff. In my opinion she had no freaking right to do so.) Basil's Something is more than likely something to do with his parents first, the thing with Mari sort of merged and grew larger, and now with his grandma basically on her death bed his darkness grows more and more. So does his loneliness... And ultimately it gives way to despair which we see when they all visit his house and Sunny goes to check up on him. His guilt and his despair had just overflowed to a breaking point and the only way he'd know how to make it stop is ending it all, and he'd thought he was doing Sunny a favor by inevitably taking his friend to the grave with him... That's my take on everything but, still the hate on Basil is uncalled for in my opinion...
I was saying that as a joke -- . But in these events (mari liveing at the tree) basil would be directly involved Maris death . And Aubry I agree with you every step of the way with Aubry she says that everyone abandoned her when she herself caused them to abandoned her as she bullied  basil (maybe that's why kel is against Aubry but not basil) and the timeing of her story arc makes more feel like "oh she did a bad thing now for here's a sad backstory to make everyone feel bad" as it happened RIGHT AFTER SHE AMOST MADE BASIL AND SNNUY SLEEP WITH THE FISHES but that's maybe is because of how little we get of real world
I honestly agree with that. I never said he wasn't involved (he definitely was) its just that he didn't do it alone as most Basil haters like to allude. Also, yeah with the Aubrey thing. Sure, she had bad parents, sure her house was crudey. But she was the one who pushed everyone else away, and to suddenly play the victim like that... Kind of makes me think she's really manipulative too.
Kim and basil
Waot didn't she beat the funky outa him?
Yes
Yeah. And basil was really into it
Nah basil a masacits (idk how to spell that) he likes pain
"masochist" is how you spell it.

Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,275,286,300 comments, and only 247,471 of them were in alphabetical order.
>!yo guys whos basil?!<
awww, basil smiling a bit in that cutscene would make a different kind of message then! ruined but its adorable now 
The whole story was just Basil's way of imagining Sunny's trauma, and they're actually all just a giant self aware dream from 12yo Basil after losing Mari and being ignored by his best friend.
"Just to clear up some confusion, Aubrey found out about what really happened to Mari after seeing >!Basils pictures!<  and told Kel and Hero. They were just pretending not to know, to make Basil and sunny feel terrible about what they did :)"
Basil is brutal




Cake.
Tbh If I had a friend like Basil, I would probably also dream about him saying something nice to me. Basil is the best
what is basil doing in the shadows
I love how DW Basil knowing so much about flower symbolism means that Sunny remembered something that Basil told him over 4 years ago. He listens to and internalizes Basil's info dumping and I think that's so cute 😭
Pretty sure the Official Polaroids are also designed in a way that the Omori and Basil ones can hold hands
don't forget an omori twitter post that has a line from basil saying "the more i chase after you, the more my heart is torn to shreds"
Also don’t even get me started on basil also calling him perfect
I always saw it as Basil calling Omori boring as fuck (and apparently bulbous???)
This is my boring friend Omori! He's basic and also fat.. . …
I see why Omori did the sillies to him now...
how does that refute Basil calling him perfect?
That's not what Basil means here. His use of cute is closer to these definitions:. . > [Affected or contrived to charm; mincingly clever; precious; cutesy.](). . > [Mentally keen or discerning](). . > [trying to be clever, sometimes in a rude or unpleasant way: ](). . > [clever in an appealing way](). . This is actually the original meaning of "cute".
. Maybe he's trying to >!overshadow/obscure his disdain for the boy.!<. . . >!OMORI's adventure in Headspace is kicked off [by having BASIL banished to Black Space.]() While we're at it, a major part of said adventure has [his]() [other]() [friends]() [forgetting that]() [he exists.]()!<. . . >!Inside Black Space, [BASIL]() [dies]() [several]() [times.]() One example is presumably caused [by OMORI.]() Consider that OMORI's never attempting to prevent these.

Maybe the moon is made out of pudding
What does this mean?
I don't think my scenario is unlikely.. . . >!Even in Faraway Town, [SUNNY vandalised BASIL's photo album]() and ditched him, and then [he ditched BASIL again while he was having a breakdown.]() Also, he considered [leaving BASIL for dead]() as an option, [twice.]() Finally, and in his imagination, he has BASIL [apologise to him for "causing [him] so much trouble,"]() and being a burden whenever he tries to help.!<
\>Even in Faraway Town, [SUNNY vandalised BASIL's photo album]() and ditched him. .

A commercial, spamton is taking notes extremely aggressively. Ralsei and basil are concerned
Fun fact! A couple months ago, when this happened once, I had the idea of Spamton taking notes from an ad, ralsei saying "Uhm, spamton?"  Basil saying "C- can we watch..." and omori saying "OH MY GOD ITS BEEN 3 HOURS CAN WE WATCH SOMETHING DIFFERENT!?". .

LMAOOOO 
>!I'm... your uncle?!<
>!This is a very interesting headcanon, but the problem is that it would hardly work simply because Basil is involved. If Sunny told the full story, then they would want to hear from Basil if it was true, and if he didn't tell about Basil's involvement, the friends would still find suspicious (don't say it) that Sunny talked about it right after him and Basil beat the crap out of eachother, and Basil probably wouldn't be able to come with an excuse for what happened.!<
Nah Basil's last name is Parodi. Bro looks like the average Genoese person

i head canon basil to be greek, i think it fits him
Honestly, I prefer Basil Hawthorne. Like the Ace Attorney reference tho
The only last name headcanon I have is Basil O. Saurus. . 
My name is Basil Hartwell White
Where does he live though???
he lives at 1312 Gay People Lane, far-away town
Basil Hallward, yall should know why 😭
For sunny and Mari , I'd say Suzuki.. I don't know what the others would have apart from basil who i headcanon as British, so probably Basil smith or smt
Basil fits,cause he looks scandinavian,and that surname is a nordic surname
Omg so true!! What origin is basils last name? 🥰
omg thanks for asking 💕:. . 
omg that’s my home country!!! tysm
why basil only one with no omor 💔
Basil's last name is Papadopoulos and I cannot be convinced otherwise (resident Greek Basil truther)
Basil Brazil
Well, I'm too dumb and don't know what other last names the characters would have. I THINK Basil MIGHT be Basil Smith, but look, I did get 1 hour of sleep, so Idk 
idk but IMAGINE IF BASILS MIDDLE NAME WAS ROWAN
The lack of Nordic surnames for Basil, smh. . . For him I'm thinking: Lehtinen, Kohonen, Andersen(son)

I dunno about that one
Basil is Basil
Basil is a precious
Omori is canonically straight. Basil is probably gay tho
basil is the worst of the main gang
That's by no means a cold take.
It's actually up in the air who the worst member of the main gang is, the fanbase in divided between Basil, Aubrey, and Sunny, Basil because >!he hanged Mari and basically kickstarted the whole falling out!<, Aubrey because some people still don't forgive her >!for beating the shit out of Kel, Sunny, and Basil!< and Sunny because >!a lot of people still blame him for keeping it a secret and causing so much mental anguish for both himself and his friends!<
> Sunny >!a lot of people still blame him for keeping it a secret and causing so much mental anguish for both himself and his friends!<. . Actually I don't even absolve him form >! staging a suicide!<. . As far as I'm concerned he's just as guilty as Basil in that regard.
What?. He didn't do anything. . . >!Photo of a Rope - You hear pacing, the crunching of the grass sifting back and forth. You think you see a figure pick something off the ground, but you're not sure. You keep staring at the leaves overhead. Everything will be okay... You think...

I know this is rich coming from me, and anyone in this Sub who follows my posts and everything, but I actually think Sunny deserves forgiveness more than Basil, >!He immediately dissociated after the accident was just sorta in a daze, Basil was mostly the one responsible for the Hanging!<
Look, I know people get this take from the scrapped BSA descriptions, but I take major issue with that.. . For one they aren't even canon, but that's an entirely different can of worms.. . And second, that's by no means what they imply to begin with.. . I'm sorry, but what these descriptions tell me is that Sunny very much meant to  go along with the plan because he was afraid people would not forgive him, and even fought down his own urge to call for help, and resolved to hide the truth before Basil even did anything.. . &#x200B;. . Let me make this clear, the BSA descriptions convey a much worse image of Sunny than if I simply ignore them as non-canon alltogether.. . If I take them into account then I'd be forced to consider him worse than both Aubrey and Basil to a degree that I wouldn't even put them into the same moral tier.
So basically you say it's not canon.. . If it weren't for these description s, there would be nothing to prove that it was Basil's idea.
Essentially, yes.. . &#x200B;. . >If it weren't for these description s, there would be nothing to prove that it was Basil's idea.. . Yes. Whats wrong with that?
I literally cannot validate this because there is no source for the actual interview with OMOCAT.. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . >After all, something exists because of Basil's idea that it exists in the first place.. . This line, assuming it to be proper correct English, does not imply what you think it does. What this sentence actually means is the following:. . >*Something* exists because Basil *believes* it to exist.. . Literally. The notion of *something* even existing to begin with stems from Basil.. . It DOES NOT imply that Basil's actions caused somethings creation.. . &#x200B;. . Otherwise, it'd look as follows:. . >After all, something exists because of Basil's idea (to hang Mari) in the first place.. . *That* wording would *actually* imply *exactly* would you believe it does.. . But it is not the actual wording. It is significantly different.
The link works. The issue is that linked post itself does not provide a source to the actual interiew.. . Either way, I've edited my previous reply.. . Check it out, the line you are quoting (*After all, something exists because of Basil's idea that it exists in the first place*.) is not implying what you believe it to do.
Hmm i never thought of it that way.. . >(After all, something exists because of Basil's idea that it exists in the first place.) is not implying would you believe it to do.. . Wouldn't it be better like this. "something exists because of Basil's believes it exists ". . Any way. İ still believe it is canon.. . >!Basil= hanging.. Sunny= kill.!<. . I think their fault have to different each other
Basil is cute and I love him
I think Basil is... uh... he's... Oh, nevermind.
The big question is Basil, it's certainly going to be harder to forgive him just due to how much that ended up hurting their friend group. In the end, the best path is that Basil and Sunny seem to be friends after everything, and since Sunny seems like he would be able to keep his friends, that link would likely allow Basil to stay around, even if things are tense at the beginning.. . However it is important to note, that his potentially only link to the friend group is moving away, and without Sunny it's hard to tell what will happen with Basil.
Basil does really have a opinion??1??1?1!!1?1 
That's assuming >!Sunny didn't simply omit Basil participating in a cover-up. He could just tell them that Basil simply saw the body already dangling - the part about him being convinced that Sunny didn't do it is true and adds up to it!<
I don't like that ending, the whole idea was that you have to face the truth, that even if it is more convenient to get away with a lie that eventually the guilt is going to eat you up.
Accidentally pushing Basil into water.
she got mad lucky that the other three were there. Instant manslaughter charge right there.
Oh yeah, i guess that's true
>!Yes, it was somewhat confirmed by the true ending/additional Basil scene!<
What's with the game's obsession with >!losing fingers in the black/red spaces? Dream Basil loses a finger, Omori (presumably) loses fingers.!< Maybe I haven't read into the game as much as I should have (I was rushing a little bit to get ad much of the story ASAP) but it really doesn't make sense to me. I just don't understand how it all fits or if it was just there to make the game scarier
One word: violin
fingers are arguably the most important part of the body when it comes to playing instruments
Also, as someone who was learning to play violin, you basically have to injure your fingers til they toughen up. Touching and pressing metal strings so much for so often does a lot to hurt your fingers.
My left fingertips are noticeably more tough and less sensitive than my right fingertips(I play the violin)
Also an important part of >!pushing people, and one of the Truth photos includes hands with very prominent fingers.!<
I totally forgot about the decent where there’s the hand that keeps getting fingers chopped. Man that was creepy.
There are a lot of potential answers to this, but my personal take on the truth section with the missing fingers is that each step you get closer to uncovering the truth feels like cutting your fingers off one by one.
Kid named Omori
Coming back I do want to note that **I** think, although his memory and logic could understand she died in the bed, his repression, the open eye, and his emotional state left *him* more convinced that she died from the hanging. It mixes with the knowledge that the fall killed her while it's in his subconscious since he never processed any of it. Part of why Blackspace is constantly killing Basil, imo.
I'd disagree against no ghosts or spirits. The man in the Graveyard says he hears "The spirits roaring" and correctly predicts that somebody in the town will be dying that night (Basil's Grandmother) and that someone will be grieving the next (Basil). Now that could be a lucky guess but I'd say that there is a supernatural element to Omori.
That sounds like a Banshee reference. The Banshee is a ghost/fairy that wails a frightening cry when someone is going to pass away and either the person that hears it will be the next to die or suffer from great loss the passing will give them.. . It's possible the man was close to Basil's family or at least grandmother, for him to hear Banshee wails. Maybe that is why Basil is more terrified by his SOMETHING, because he hears the wail of a Banshee and thinks it's Mari calling to him from beyond the grave. When really it's just a Banshee mourning for Basil's soon to be late grandmother.
Wait what? When was this?
If you go to the graveyard behind the church on THREE and TWO DAYS LEFT I believe, you can talk to a man who says this.
Does Basil's grandma die?
Ye, she's rushed to hospital the day the graveyard dude talks about somebody dying and the next day, you see her standing in the middle of the road shortly before disappearing, heavily implying she died in the hospital.
Oh wow I must have missed something then.
This would be the most likely option, but you're missing one crucial fact. Sunny sees Basil's Grandma's ghost before he has any idea that she has died. Ut wouldn't make sense for him to imagine such a thing, even subconsciously, at that point, but he does see her, and low and behold, upon reaching Basil's house, the gang are informed that she died at the hospital earlier in the day.. With that, it seems much more plausible that Mari's ghost was in fact real to some degree.
I wonder what is Basil´s past
To be fair, we’re getting something for that ;D
 but also 
You're not joking?
?
We're getting content about Basil?
Some questions I haven't seen on this post yet:. . Who are the other random strangers roaming around in black space?. . >!What happens after Basil commits suicide and Sunny moves in one of the bad endings? Are there new Black space entries created for Basil? Is there a new Something for him too? Does Stranger cease to exist, or become the equivalent of Something for Basil?!<
the other strangers are >!previous versions of Basil from previous cycles of Headspace - who likely "leaked the truth" similar to the headspace basil we see!<
>!something is kinda physical thing like souls. aubrey stole photo album because she saw basil make mari's face black. but if you look down to holes in dreamworld it says photos are blacked something(?) it means something make mari's photo like this not basil. also basil says toilet scene: can you see it too?!<
i’d like to know what the ambience is saying in the backwards message in Basil‘s house.
There's a backwards message in Basil's house?

If you speak to MR. OUTBACK (Dancing cowboy guy in ORANGE OASIS) before he turns into sand (from entering the LOST LIBRARY), he says some stuff that implies there might have been different dreamers in the past.. . Asking him ">!Where am I?!<". . > >!**It looks different to everyone**... but this time around, it's pretty colorful and cutesy for the most part... not to mention pretty dang big!!<. . Asking him ">!Where is BASIL?!<". . > >!Well, your friend ain't here is all I can say! But I think you know you have a way of knowin' that answer. **When someone looks for the truth... the world will create a set of KEYS.**!<. . > >!And those KEYS... **they'll take a different form dependin' on the person's will**. You know what your KEYS look like, don'tcha?!<
What the hell are Basil’s parents doing? They seem to be very neglectful of him considering that he’s clearly not doing well mentally and not getting help. They seem to have dumped him as well as his grandma for some caretaker. And we never hear any mention of them at all in the game. They must be terrible parents (unless they’re dead, which I don’t believe they are)
Basil and his grandma are a CLASSIC dead parents case. . Thinking they're alive is kind of unnecessarily creating hateable characters, like dude why
A B B Y man abbyyyyy she got locked away in his memories for comiting the ultimate sin but what WAS said ultimate sin??? Does she represent his mom?? Basil?? An imaginary friend who's never mentioned?? I wanna knowwww
If this game ever updates or gets DLC as hinted at by the basil sprites id love for them to go more in-depth on the three or their pasts
Did we find out what happened to Basil's grandma?
Well Basil should be apart of that
Basil lost because of politics
Basil lost because he's not likable.
Basil is still likable in his own way.
True
No, he was killed because politics as a bunch of people riled up to vote Basil out because we were petty that Mewo was losing and they were targeting Hero
Still so mad y'all let Basil go so early. Sorry y'all were scared he would've swept 
Basil gets too much hate bruh
Ive lost my Basil, shes all I have left 😭😭😭
basil has lost it
You’re not fooling anyone with that wig, basil
basil’s in his cosplaying arc
\- She tries everything to be diferent from her mother, like having a good hygiene, not drinking or allowing the hooligans to drink, etc. And this became more prevalent after the ending.. . \- >!After Sunny told the truth, Aubrey got mad at Sunny (even if she quickly associated the accident with what she just did to Basil), and REALLY mad at Basil. After a few months she became their friend again and forgave Sunny, but she never trully forgave Basil. !<. . \- >!She also made the hooligans stop bullying Basil and Kel. Kim was the hardest to convince, since Aubrey refused to tell what happened with her friends, but Kim knew it had something to do with them, so for some time she acted more aggressively towards Basil and Kel. After Aubrey convinced Kim to stop (probably after a fight), she started to accompany Aubrey in the church, because it was the only thing she could do for her.!<. . \- Sunburn happens, but only after a few years, and only with a push from Basil, Kel and Hero (who got dragged along)
She moved in with Basil after the good ending after his grandma passed away.
O I like this
why she look like basil doe
That’s Basil with her hair
she used the heaps of trash from her mom and donated it to the recycling person for money. also her mom died after the good ending and polly and basil offered her to stay in basil's grandma's room. it was awkward at first but eventually basil and aubrey became really good friends again. she says "slay" and as much as basil hates it, he also says it every now and then.
Her crew has never actually had a serious tussle. She carries the nailed bat but would never actually plaster anyone on purpose. Instead she would threaten people but stop just before hitting them, only potentially making contact by accident. Much like >! what happened with Basil at the Lake !<. . Her real world personality and appearance is blended with Candice to create the character of sweetheart.. . Her father was trying to hold his marriage together but her mother had been broken long ago, by some unknown event between her birth and the first photograph. Her Father kept order in the house and so he was perceived as rigid and overly orderly by Aubrey when she was younger. He had his limits though, and because he was unable to maintain the house and keep Aubrey’s mom presentable, they never let her have friends over. This a whole other traumatic story we never get to see.. . She loves her mother and fondly remembers better times from her early childhood. But now she’s afraid and unable to face her, because she just doesn’t seem to register anything anymore. She cannot talk to anyone about her mother’s situation, she simply cant mentally handle it right now. The most she can do it clear a path to walk through the house and occasionally bring home a few snacks for her mom that she steals while out with the hooligans. The only relief/hope she gets is noticing her mom eating or drinking something she brought home. . . Aubrey was not allowed to get many new things because her father had trouble managing the clutter in their house. Most of her clothes were hand me downs from Mari. Sunny gifted her the Mr.Eggplant stuffed toy from his big collection. I dont know who bought the rain coat. Sometimes I feel like it makes more sense if Mari bought the coat and had the hair discussion in response to her father refusing to get it for her. Other times I like painting the father as more morally grey and not just a one dimensional struggling father, so I feel like he could’ve also bought it for his little girl.. . I suspect her family was always stretched for cash, but now a-days the only thing keeping her off the street is her father paying for the house even after he left.. . Basil and Aubrey knew each other before they met the rest of the gang. They met through church. Im still working out the details, but Basil’s grandma was a little religious and so was Aubrey’s family. . . Aubrey actually has somewhat moved on, having made new friends. She’s still got a lot of pent up unresolved anger, but her new new friend group is actually quite wholesome when they’re not threatening people. As with the rest of the old friend group, she will begin to slowly drift away as the next chapter of her life begins.. . She definitely cares about Sunny and Kim, but I dont read into these as romantic ships but more of a softer side of her we dont normally see. With Kim she’s definitely a bestie. With Sunny I think maybe something is there, but there’s just too much baggage for anything to really grow there… at this time. Maybe that could change one day, but I suspect that they also continue to slowly drift apart after the events of the game.. . In the good ending, >!she pities Basil and Sunny even more and eventually forgives them both, sooner rather then later, because she’s had some pretty close brushes with accidental death herself in the past. Some witnessed in game, some not. The romance with Sunny might die out after learning he did the manslaughter onto his sister. There’s some hope it stays alive if she’s empathic enough, and they stay in touch. Like everyone else, she’ll never look at Basil the same way though. !<. . In the neutral endings, >!If the player slept at Basil’s house, Aubrey will also commit suicide shortly after, because she feels responsible for Basil’s suicide. In the knife ending, this leads to a domino suicide of the entire omori gang.!<. . >!If the player slept at basils house then abandoned by going home, Aubrey will always have a small part of her that fears Sunny actually murdered Basil for some reason, but she wont kill herself.!<. . In the bad ending, >! she is confused and traumatized by Sunny’s death, but the gang promises to stick together and make it through this. Could go either way here, either a domino suicide again, beginning with Basil or they power through !<
Careful friend, your spoiler tags aren’t working!
Thanks! I seem to have dyslexia when applying them
after like 1 year of the truth she helped basil dyed his hair, she and basil are bff
Whaaat? Who made that? That's awesome
The Austrians might actually somewhat save basil (oh and its close to the other mural I'm watching, which is like upper left of it)
The Austrians.
Austrian Basil chad.
In fact we don't appreciate it at all. At least they asked for the other 2 cjaracters first
The omori discord
It was the omori discord server
we just made him minutes ago  . Omori Disc's got a thread for r/place (its listed in the event) if u wanna help out
oh, alright thanks!
Honestly it looks like r/place is a big turf war over all the subs and i love it
There's a reason why it's only his head.
And arms.
Omg and Lea's right next to him
:O
Best boy Basil right next to best girl Lea
And Lea is right next to best cat Niko.
He's not a cat!
Best creature Niko
Perfect
Yay! Babil
I saw him and got unreasonably happy
is it possible to get the full collage on mobile?
Obligatory “bagel”
We must defend the boi! (Besides the corner)
He’s been decapitated hahaha
Epic
yesss i didnt notice im gonna look for him now
KEEP HIM SAFE AT ALL COST
I know I just found him too!
Badil
Yes babil
How do you draw in r/place?
Bro could you send the link to wherever you can place pixels
babl
also a lea. . btw play crosscode
The void is approaching basil and everything else rapidly, make sure to keep up with basil!
WHAT ARE THE COORDS. . #880/276
Begel
The discord made him
omg the little "hi!" its so cute dude
Is that KOS-MOS next to him? Impressive
Nah it's lea from crosscode
i just noticed how its only his head. . not amused discord not amused
Another member joins the cute squad
AAAAAAAAAA HE IS SO CUTEEEE
**YAY! OUR BASIL GETS LOVE FROM THIS AUSTRIANS! HE DESERVES THIS FOR BEING SUCH A SWEET BOY!!!**
basil is dying :(
Yeah I saw this I was YASSSS
dont forget niko also
Basil fans were still salty that team ABC voted Both Basils out successfully
i'll forever be a basil apologist 😾
I'm just surprised how we were able to vote him out out of pettiness
That’s just Emo Basil lmaoo
So  basil's headspace is just a poorly made maze?. . ...on second thought that might be accurate.
I really like looking at this image. He looks very polite.
“oh, sorry!” - plushie babil after stepping on a flower.
Ah! So sorry!

It fits so much. I love him.
Thank you
He's Canadian
I'm saving this
Bagel is canadian confirmed 
sorgy acciden
He somehow looks LESS Traumatized than his headspace plushie counterpart
Probably because he doesn’t have that awkward open mouthed grin . . 
bro looks like this. . 
>!"Oh God oh fuck Omori has a knife someone help me"!<
He's everything I could've wanted, and more! I'm so happy with his gentle smile. Every single plushie got a photo that showed them surrounded by their most important hobbies and beloved things, and Basil's shows him surrounded by all of his friends. Not even flowers as the main focus, but his friends. *They* are his most precious thing in the world. That's touching! . . It warms my heart as it makes me think of how >!everything will be alright post-good ending, surrounded by friends that have once again come together and love each other!<.

Reminds me of a certain plushie review of a black haired overpowered anime protagonist
. . Welp. He's precious. Guess I'm dropping part of my paycheck on this.
burger pants was fitting for that last comment.
Burger Pants is love, Burger Pants represents modern life  .
Bagel

YAAAAAAAAAY IT’S THE BABIL AAAAAAAH HE’S SO ADORABLE I MUST HAVE HIM!!!. . 
BABIL SUPREMACYYYYY 
I love the RW plushie designs so much-
He looks so polite here. It's cute
I must have him. He must become mine. I will cuddle with him each and every night until the day I die.
Real
Can’t wait for them to sell out in literally 2 seconds
10 minutes 
Oh sweet Neptune my poor heart
He's so silly! 
Bagel plushie looks like he's barely hanging on to his sanity.
Where's his garden shears?

i'm hoping to get him soon since i wasn't able to get headspace bagel unu
His hair looks like lemon pudding 🥄
Rain world colab? W (the rain world brian rot is getting to me)

He’s smiling. I’m so happy they chose to not give him a nervous expression. >!Post-good ending!< for the win!
AAUAUAUAUA I NEED HIM...
Any release date yet?
i cant wait to terrorize it

I WANT IT I NEED IT 
why does it look like he has mutton chops?
Silly little guys
The best part of Basil being a cute plushie is that he can no longer [REDACTED]
I am screaming right now. This is the best image I could’ve seen today.. . My friend will be VERY pleased to see this. 
Wait FOR REAL!!!!
These are adorable! Do you make these or know where to buy them?
I want him
holy shit this is happening around my birthday i can get all of them
BABIL 😢
I wanna punch it
I know! I love basil!
Basil should perish
no
So we can’t vote out Basil? Personally I’m fine with that! But you should probably change that next time 
Id say thats pretty based
The game was rigged from the start :2463:
Where's basil?
In my heart
Why isn’t basil an option?
Why cant we vote out basil
Oops, I added him now
Tyy
GET OUT BASIL
DW Basil becuz of how little he's there

Hs Basil, like, who is he?
GET BASIL OUT
basil out
I remember when I first played Omori I made sure to read out all of Basil's lines in the best "50 something year old man with a history of alcoholism and smoking problems from the southeastern United States" impression I could do just for shits and giggles.
Now I’m imagining basil scout
Nein junge Basil don’t touch das plant! Dat plant is den weedsmoken!
Bassy basil gives me life. Good lord, now I'm picturing him like James Earl Jones.
basil get ze flammenwerfer
The gun that werfers flammen? Mein gott.
What kind of British voice tho? A posh hoity toity, a cockney voice, maybe Scottish or Welsh? I'm imagining cockney Basil and it's hilarious!
I don't know why or how, but my brain gives so many characters light accents of a mix of like German and russian, I do that accent to so many characters, I think I just like the accent and it just fits . . I give basil around the same voice, just with a bit more British judged in there
That fits my other head canon that basil will grow up to love/grow the devil's lettuce.
>!IF he grows up that is... !<
*takes a massive drag off a strange looking pipe* . . Aw yeah dude, totally will. It's all sunshine and rainbows following the good ending. . . *Offers you the pipe* copium?
Sure.. . *Dies of copium overdose*
Shiiiiiiiiiiet *hangs you from tree*
*starts haunting you as a trauma demon thing*
Oho-ho-ho-shiet... *Stabs the eye of whoever reads this next* fuggin ghost.
i also thought basil could be of german descent for some reason
Holy lord I just looked up a clip on YouTube, that's like exactly the voice I gave basil, I need to watch this now x.x
Basil got his face planted into a birthday cake when he was 7
Then he started crying
waa
Sammmeee
basil didn't bomb that senior center, I'm telling the truth guys. all those allegations are just not true >:(



The chicanery has breached containment

Thank you for informing me of this

LMAO

I'm keeping your secret safe
random question why the fuck are there so many breaking bad memes on this subreddit
Because omori is bad. Just like breaking bad
r/omocanery
omg it was a breaking bad reference how did you get that. . edit: I was looking at the one comment my bad
i like this one. headcanoning basil as a tad neurotic and just a ball of anxiety is perfect imo. i’d say there’s probably a reason the hooligans were so quick to bully basil even with aubrey’s lead
Exactly. I was bullied as a child, and bullies don't act out of nowhere. The reason might be stupid, or just you being a good target, but there's a reason. (Please don't read this as me justifying bullying.) Idk, because of exactly this I feel kind of off put by people making him out to just be this really nice kid because IRL he would probably be sort of uncomfortable.
Yeah I headcanon him having a soft and breathy voice too. . Albeit that’s because I watched NicoB’s let’s play and now his voice for Basil is my headcanon lmao
Basil is a local drug dealer in faraway town 
He sells and grows weed.
Faraway town is located in 308 Negra Arroyo Lane aparrently
Sunny buys a little bit. . Hero personally doesn’t smoke it, but he buys some for his collegemates that ask for it. . Aubrey and the hooligans just steal it off Basil. . Basil doesn’t bother trying to sell to Kel ( “BASIL! Don’t you remember the warning on Sprout Mole Eater? Winners don’t do drugs!”)
Basil mains pyro in tf2 fight me
I'd argue but I don't know who else he would main. . maybe >!spy     !<  for funny reasons or demo because he saw a demoflower meme once
Maybe engineer
I could picture him like comparing builds to flowers and caring for them and stuff. . Actually I can’t picture him playing anything other than Engie now.
I can imagine him pulling a lazypurple and sobbing over his dead buildings, then running battle Engie for vengeance lmao
"my turret "
"Lazy what kind of defense is tha-". . "I AM THE DEFENSE!"
mmmph
Indeed
I have thought about this and basil would hold v and say “I’m sorry for killing you..” every time he killed someone
For me, he would see how much medic is loved and try to main him but would suck so bad he’s just play as soldier whenever someone else appears as medic
Basil learnt one or two things about dealing with parasites using poisons while he was serving in both WW1 and Vietnam (don't ask me how)
basil doesn't have a high voice
It doesn’t matter the pitch but I hold onto the belief that Basil’s voice is raspy and always on the verge of coughing profusely
he’s always on that kush
Grandma *cough* I-I need to sell your TV Grandma *heavy coughing*
I like to think that Sunny and Basil actually have the same vocal range
best comment
Fr these voice headcanon videos always give him a girly voice but my brother (who's also 16) sounds like an adult man
I always imagined him having a voice similar to 9S from NieR or Hope from FFXIII.
Basil would probably be a excellent spy
*He could be amy one of us*
He could be you, He could be ME, HE COULD EVEN BE-
***WOAHWOAHWOAH***. . (This is my third time typing this exact line this month.)
What IT WAS OBVIOUS
He's the RED Spy! Watch, he'll turn red any second now.
Aaannnyyyy second now
See, RED! No wait, that's blood.
Then we still have problem
Biiig Problem
Alright, who's going to search the spy?
Right behind you
I love you guys. We need a omori and tf2 crossover
oi mate ima stab yo fookin eye out you little wanker bruv  . \-Basil
ROADMAN BASIL, NOW YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE HIM A VAPE SO HE AND AUBREY THE CHAV CAN HAVE THEIR SCRAP OUTSIDE LIDL
basil has a secret tumblr blog and his fav anime character is kaworu nagisa
He WOULD ship Shinji and Kaworu tho
im laughing and crying and dying my brain erased all memory of evangelion
Basil 100% listens to Weezer
Basil is never getting bitches confirmed
Basil sent a Weezer meme to Jschlatt several times confirmed.
Pinkerton specifically
Basil is secretly made of basil
Basil having vaguely feminine interests does not make him gay nor is it evidence of it
The fact we even gender interests is already stupid enough. Everyone should be able to do whatever they want without having to think what others think about them. Be like Basil. Consume flowers, grow them and help your friend when they need help.
...Consume flowers?
Plot twist.. that flower on Basil's head.. It wasn't put there.. it's literally growing from Basil's face :) Basil is a flower. Basil consumes flowers and makes them. 
I like men so therefore i will project it onto my favorite fictional charaters 
Same, it’s not my fault he’s adorable, super cute and I just want to platonically cuddle with him and tell him everything’s gonna be ok 
He's 16 
It’s legal to fuck those in some places

UKULELE
true! he is gay because i said so
Hey, OP asked for headcanons, not factual statements!
This>>>>>>>
I agree that femininity in men doesn't equal them being gay, but there is a *lot* more evidence of Basil at the very least liking men, particularly Sunny, than just that. I'm not saying people have to headcanon Basil as gay or even into men, but when others say that there's nothing to support Basil not being straight other than "haha he like flower!!!" is a flat out lie.. . This is coming from a Sunburn shipper, I'm not trying to convert people into Sunflower or something, I'm just stating what I think. A lot of people have this "straight unless stated otherwise" mindset and it kinda annoys me.
Exactly. Him being gay has nothing to do with his interests.
Something about the omori Fandom reinforcing harmful gay stereotypes rubs me the wrong way 
I once read a fanfic where Basil was raised by a buff Russian guy.
send link, i need to see it
You guys never fail to surprise me
Gimme link
Gimme link
. For everyone who asked
Basil is nice
This comment is so wholesome and underrated.  I like it
The reason Polly knows barely anything about Basil is because she works in geriatric care, and is probably untrained to deal with him.. . That, and her social skills don't seem that great
In my opinion, >!Basil's grandma was the only other person who knew what Basil did to protect Sunny. Basil wanting to die right after she passed away makes sense on a surface level even if you know she's the only relative he has AT THE MOMENT, since we know Basil's parents aren't dead, they're just busy with work, so it's not like he has no family left and therefore he's actually, really all alone. However, it makes sense on a deeper level, to me at least, if he confided in her and she didn't condemn him for wanting to defend his friend and ultimately making a really big mistake in what he actually did. She would have been his last tether to sanity even through Aubrey's bullying and it would make sense he'd completely lose his will to live when she died.!<
Basil’s just more worried about the fact his best friend’s been nowhere to be seen for 4 years
I like to think that basil has an extremely high pitched voice. High pitched to the point where if Basil screams dogs would be able to hear it.
xbox live
Basil’s parents are career criminals, and were convicted of nine counts of life insurance fraud eight years before the game takes place. Before they were unceremoniously shipped off to serve out their multiple life sentences, they taught a very young Basil everything they knew about picking a mark, staging a suicide, and doctoring a Last Will and Testament. . . . Almost none of this information stuck, hence why Basil is not living high on the hog after exploiting his grandmother’s exceptionally large life insurance payout.
This is hilarious. I would love to see a side story where Basil confesses the event to his parents, and they go on an adventure to cover it up and lie to the cops, all while convincing Basil not to tell anyone.
I mean the one on his head has to be plastic cuz it still looks the same after a week.( or maybe it's a parasite feeding on basil's flesh)
Following the theory that Sans is Ness, Basil is Ralsei
In any ending, >!basil is fucked either way no matter what route sunny takes. We know that in the neutral/ hikimori routes, he takes his own life due to his guilt/denial of the incident. The true ending can’t be as bad right? Hell no. Although he would feel relieved for confessing the truth, he would be considered a murderer for a long time. Its hard to forgive someone for assisting in covering up a beloved ones murder, maybe they will never forgive him. Since basil is staying behind, he would probably get the front end of everyone’s anger. He would most likely once again be an outcast and though unlikey, aubrey would bully basil again since she would feel like she has an actual reason to. He would feel even more anxious being more of a social outcast, and with no one to turn to since sunny is gone, he is going to have an even harder time trying to manage his fragile mental state.!<. . Edit: small spelling errors/sentence formatting errors
I think the outcome of sunny revealing the truth entirely depends on basil's argumentative skills, which are not shown throughout the game, so there's still chance for a bittersweet outcome for him
i hardly think basil is gonna be bullied again. that would be double standards, like ok we forgive snuuy for murdering, but basil gonna eat shit for being accomplice. if anything, it should be the other way around. and i don't think kel or hero would support that
Sure, whatever. . . >!That just seems like kind of a reach to avoid giving Basil his fair and complete part of the blame, even without the album text you can tell Sunny was absolutely out of it the whole time. He didn't "agree" or was "happy" about any of this because he was in shock, like, we're talking about how he straight up started blocking all this from his mind immediately. The game is literally about him remembering all this. And it still doesn't change the fact that Basil did the actual thing. Either way, I'm personally convinced if this had been explained as an accident from the beginning things wouldn't have turned anywhere as bad as they did. Also, the fact that Sunny came out and told everyone what really happened, as opposed to Basil who would have rather commit murder-suicide than confess, may help give him some lenience. I'm actually deadly curious as to what Basil told the group happened before Sunny came into the room because there's no way they didn't ask him about it!<
I feel like I should have known better than to argue with a Basil fan so this will be my last post, but I didn't say either of them was evil. My point was that if you try to put their actions objectively to consider forgiveness, one kid did something awful accidentally and covered it up but still fought a terrible battle against himself to reveal the truth , while the other choose an incredibly stupid way to cover it (and this is not just me, I've seen people in this place say that the reveal was so extreme it took them out of the story), which caused great amounts of suffering and anguish for years, then decided to take the coward's way out and drag the friend he was supposed to protect with him. Make of that what you will. This did make me consider something else that I may make a thread about in the future though, so thank you for that
Treating me as some fan of just because I disagree with you is not doing wonders for your argument, as I laid reasonable claims. >!Sunny lied about what happened to Mari towards everyone, including Basil, this is a fact in the story pointed out by Sunny and Omori himself, he knew deep down what really happened and choose to repress it. It's not all on Basil and blaming everything on him for how all turned out hurts the themes of the game.!<
Good bot!
Just because you made/believe in edgy garbage doesn't make it automatically realistic. I'd say this is real edgy but then there's the garbage that is YBM/Purshit.
i think its pretty realistic to hate a murderer, especially one who killed a beloved friend, but thats just me
yeah i replied to u at like 2 am yesterday. my bad. >!but still, even though basil was an accomplice, i think its fair to say that the group would be angry at basil for being involved with sunny’s murder and hiding the truth for the past 4 years. basils actions may not be as horrible as sunny’s but it does not mean that the group can feel very bitter towards him. !<
Omg im bagel 
basil was not in the game nearly long enough for me to get attached to him like with the other characters
Basil is a damsel in distress, of course we aren't going to see him that often there, is now Zelda a bad character?
We do see him in the photo album a lot of moments and even his own thoughts of everyone to make us understand that there is more to him than trauma. I do wish however that we had at least one day when we spend time with him, but with the way the story was written, it would not really work, because much of the point is that our relationship with him is tarnished and the only way to move forward with our life is saving him, unless we want an ending where you cut ties with everyone, but that wouldn't be nice. . . Personally, I am more for a Basil route, where only he and Sunny are playable, and we reconnect with the others through their bond.
no but she certainly has no screentime if shes always in need of saving? its not about quality, theyre all really well written characters, but basil certsinly had less screen time, and im saying that with him as my favorite chwracter!
Zelda has enough screentime to make us care about her and the same is true for Basil, if not more so, since we spend more time with him than we did with Zelda in the latest mainline game of that series. . . At this rate, Basil gets his own route where he and Omori as well as Sunny go on an adventure to save their friends.
basil more like byesil
basil would be the first death in a danganronpa crossover game
honestly i feel like he would either die first or kill first 
i dunno, i don't think that he could bring himself to kill first
Half the fandom thinks he is a dangerous psychopath and a menace to society, and the other half thinks he is a femboi. Take what I said as you will.
Those two are not mutually exclusive
dangerous femboi
Accident
Nah, the >!suicide case!< always comes later in the game.
oof
If Sunny is the main character, then it would make more sense for Basil to kill in the fifth case. . The fifth case always has the close friend as a culprit. . (That, or he’d be a late game victim)
>!it would probably be similar to chihiro’s death!<
I feel like Basil has very sensitive, soft skin. He bleeds easily and his skin is kinda thin. . . He always has broken skin on his nails and he pulls them a lot.. . He smells like moist dirt.. . He's vegetarian.. . He cried watching Dolphin Tales.. . He always has a small layer of dirt under his nails.. . He gets sunburned very easily and takes a beach umbrella with him outside so he can stick it in the ground while he's tending to flowerbeds.. . He doesn't keep the postcards his parents send him from wherever they travel to.. . At school, if he wasn't with the gang during recess, he hangs out with the girls who make loombands and friendship bracelets at the benches.. . Aubrey and Basil secretly made a pinky promise to always treat eachother like honorary brother and sister because they were jealous that the rest of the people in their friend group had an elder sibling.. . Aubrey's mom knows Basil and actually kinda likes him but Basil is just scared around her.. . He is a femboy.
Basil is a nickname, his real name is Bradley
STOP OF ALL THE NAMES YOU COULD HAVE GIVEN HIM
okay you win this is the worst one 😢
I feel like Basil was almost definately depressed even before the incident. I mean what 12 year old would know how to tie a noose?
A noose is a knot used in gardening too
The kind that listens to rusty cage
definitely\*
they're used for hanging plants
Basil’s grandma, up until she became ill, could and would whoop anyone’s ass if they bullied Basil.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but doesn’t basil leave a smell on your fingers if you rub the leaves?
Yes it does, why?
Wouldn’t that could as a smell?
well yeah?
Basil would deffiently kin Baofu If he ever played persona. >!Dude lost his Friend in a accident 5 years ago. and got trauma!< so. Why wouldnt he?
basil is italian
Basil's flower is literally growing out of his head
I really wish this post was spoiler tagged so I wouldn't have to figure out how the heck you do it on mobile. I guess I'll do my headcanon in a spoiler-free way. Basil has a dangerously soft skull.. . Edit: spelling
Do you mean soft?
Yes I did, sorry about that. I am tired.
Basil eats ice cream with a fork
basil sounds like a dying old man
This one is potentially triggering so I'm putting a spoiler on it in case. . >!I have a headcanon that Basil has issues with Self harm in different aspects of it. We know he has issues with coping, and he probably uses it as an unhealthy coping mechanism, at least to me that makes sense. Idk.!<
Ngl, when I first played Omori, I thought Basil was a femboy lmao

He is
I said unpopular
Headcanon: When no one is around, Basil secretly eats his flowers
Basil listens to Cosmo Sheldrake and Cavetown
Basil may or may not be an reincarnation of Monika
That’s the difference between you and I, Basil Omori. I’m an alpha gaymer.
Well I'm not a gaymer, so maybe they'll respect me
Whenever I did voicing with my friends for OMORI, I always used a higher yet raspier voice for Basil. It makes sense AND lets me practice my Nagito Komaeda voice. . . (Edit: Komaeda not Komaedw)
1.Basil knew what he was doing >!when he saw sunny enter the room on day 1!<. . 2. Basil's voice is not super effeminate . . 3. Basil's parents probably left him because they were too young . . 4. >!Basil should've called 911!<
basil listens to weezer
Basil used to be a theater kid
He tastes like basil. . And watermelin
No, Basil isn’t secretly super strong IRL.  He had garden shears in that fight for a reason.
Basil wasn't okay ever, even before the accident.
Basil did nothing wrong.
Basil is my favorite but NOTHING WRONG? NOTHING AT ALL?
I must admit, I have barely started the game, so I might be biased. So far, he seems like the most gentle and innocent of the children.
Get the fuck out of here and come back after you finish
Holy shit YES PLEASE come back when you finish the game this will be wild
Ok so… Basil did do wrong, but like, he’s smol and cute though. I just can’t hate or dislike him. He desperately needs a hug and some emotional support
Basil is straight.
basil is overrated as fuck
close

Bad bot
Basils characterization by the fandom of a soft femboy with a high voice is terrible.. his canon character is great!! I just can barely look at basil fan content without ppl making him out as a stereotypical soft shy boy
>!Basil wanted to commit suicide. That's why he knows how to tie a noose!<
I think Basil was possibly suicidal, think about it a tad.. I don’t have many details, but young basil doesn’t seem all that happy compared to his friends (regardless of our lack of details) and it would explain why he knew how to tie a noose
that basil hates the herb basil 
Basil is aro/ace.
I 100% agree 
Basil is straight . . CRY ABOUT IT
Another unpopular headcanon: >!Basil's creation of something backfired more than he ever thought possible. Not only did his idea of hanging Mari made everything worse, Sunny began using something to force Basil to do what he wants. Basil wanted at one point tell the truth with Sunny, but he had none of it and told him that something is going to kill both of them, if he were to tell anyone about what really happened with Mari. Sunny would then ruin the Photo Album eventually and tell Basil that he if he dared to reveal what happened to the Photo Album or if he tried to restore it, something would kill everyone he ever loved. Since then Basil had been terrified and never tried talking with others ever since.!<. . A more positive one>! Basil managed with the power of faith to have his own thoughts and feelings bleed into Sunny's in his dreams with the White egged Orchid, as they symbolize the phrase in the flower language: My thoughts follow into your dreams.. All of this is the reason why Sunny had such frequent dreams of saving Basil and why he came to remember the truth, as he repressed it, while Basil knew what happened.  Due to Basil being conscious about the incident with Mari, Sunny was able to remember it and Stranger is in fact the conscience of Basil wanting both of them to be released of their guilt. Stranger and thus Basil are the ultimate good guys in the headspace storyline and helped Sunny to come out with the truth, leading to a good ending.!<
my hc is the basil is the only straight one in the friend group
Basil is actually a sociopath and Omori only likes him for mutual assistance.. . He planned this from the start
From what I've noticed a bit of people seem to think basils gay. I hc that he's actually the straightest man youll ever meet in your life. And that he smokes a shit ton of weed.
You aren't the first person to have that birthday, so you don't claim that day, it is for everyone born on that day. . . Basil entered the world on this day as Babil and became  our beloved Basil!
Impossible
Nothing is impossible with Basil as friend.
Turns out we were all wrong guys, the real reason basil >!stabs himself!< is because he read this.
Least obsessed Basil fan
Basil is not real, and do you think before writing a comment? I'm pretty sure you're a troll
Basil is afraid of flowey
Everybody thinks Basil would be a vegetarian but I disagree. He likes plants too much. Basil is a carnivore.
Just like people become vegetarian because they love animals, basil would be a carnivore because he loves plants
Exactly
[my basil headcanon voice]()
Basil loves meat and even makes smoothies with bacon
Basil listens to Car Seat Headrest
i guess basil is german now damn
I headcannon that basils parents are actually either covert agents of part of a criminal underground
His parents form part of an illegal group of weed contrabandists, they are rich and are wanted Internationally, that's why they can't visit their son often, but still, he receives enough amount of money to pay for his basic needs. That income comes principally from the money they 'wash'.. So yeah, Basil's kin is mostly criminal, he could have acquired some of those traits too
Basil commited tax fraud
Basil had 2 older brothers; Flower and Rowan. Flower was the kind brother, who also was a bit too hard on himself and a perfectionist, like Mari. He hates messing stuff up and feels bad when he makes a mistake, like really bad. He also was the kindest person Basil knew and is the reason why he became so gentle. He was 10 years older than Basil. Basil loves him and thinks about him everyday as he inspired him to become the boy we all love and know. . Rowan was the other older brother by 5 years and despite having a nice side, is very wrathful, aggressive and especially very mean to anyone for even the slightest transgressions. He reacts often aggressively to Basil and Flower messing stuff up, so their parents and their caretakers, as well as his siblings themselves even had to calm him down. He influenced Basil into becoming more anxious and panicky due to his sudden violent outbursts and that let to Basil developing a lot of problems later in live, such as anxiety and even >!psychosis!<. . Spoilers are now coming: >! During an argument between Flower and Rowan, Rowan struck Flower down with Flower's trophy for best florists out of jealously and copying his techniques of plant care. This killed the poor Flower and Basil saw it all. He comforted his brother and encouraged him to tell the truth about this. It ended badly as their parents disowned him and so did his entire environment. He was sent to a mental hospital from which he escapes and tried to kill Basil for "ruining his life" one night and when Basil asks who is it,, Rowan said something and attack his brother with a knife..This ended with Basil stabbing him in the stomach with Garden Shears and their parents send Rowan to a juvenile prison. He escapes and his whereabouts are unknown. To this day Basil is still unsure if it was his brother, but deep down he knows this. All of this happened when Basil was 5 years old. That is why Basil came up with the idea to hang Mari, because he is afraid of the same story repeating with Rowan, if he was honest.!<
Basil really likes Washington, because he finds him to be a historical doppelgänger of some sort, like an idealized version of himself.
>!I do not like the meta context this creates for the poll, it scares me!<
>!The spoiler tag didn’t quite work just remove the space between “!” And “haha” to fix it!<

Oh, hello there SHAW


. . Post this cat instead
garama superior
Poll: [ . . r.i.p Basil 
How many votes was it between MEWO and DW Basil?
it was like a 7 vote difference last time i checked it lmao
in the end it was a 23 vote difference
I can't see results
I can't see them either, I think OP may have blocked us all from seeing the results to make it more suspenseful waiting for the results the next day
Well i find this poll stupid anyways 
Why was i downvoted to oblivion ❔❔
Because everybody is invested on how this is going to end
Seriously? This goofy ahh poll?
Yes. . Barely any event happens in the Omori community
No. . 
Nu uh. . 
Lets get down to business and KILL THE BOY!
Can i get a B? Can i get an A? Can i get an SIL? Hooray!!
Yeah that was pretty bad for such a mild comment. 
Based
Destroy the other basil and all will be good in the world
No, destroy all the other dream world versions because they're OBJECTIVELY LESS INTERESTING than the REAL ONES
Thats cap as fuck
This is what I’ve been saying the whole time!
Destroy the melon
Destroy her >!Dead best friend!<
This is the way.
No, NO YOU ARE TRIPPING OUT IF WE DIDNT HAVE BASIL SUNNY WOULD NEVER GET THERAPY
If we didn't have basil, sunny would be so much more mentally stable
True ending: basil is key for a true route, true ending needs you to TALK TO BASIL, also shuddup, if sunny didn’t have Mari he would also be mentally stabler but I don’t see you hating mari
RIP  As long as RW Basil is alive I'm good. Let's do DW Hero next 
Basil fans are on their last quarter.. . 
We will prevail
dw basil barely even exists but rw basil has a lot to offer in terms of character, i think he will make it a while and maybe even the end
People hated him too much. . This is probably the first one that I'm genuinely upset about because Basil as a character is so interesting and he has so much to offer if people didn't just categorise him as an "uwu flower femboy", like he has real issues and struggles and yet people see him as something barely worth looking at . . Anyway sorry for the small rant lol
I mean considering he did what he thought would be good for his friend but it ended up ripping his friend group apart and he didn't see his best friend for the next 4 years, I think he deserves to be a little whiny lmao
r/agedlikemilk
Personally I think Basil winning would be way too predictable so I hope we can vote him out sooner than later to keep things interesting
>!basil was sent to black space again!<
NOOOOOOO
Man. I actually wasn't expecting this. I thought that maybe thanks to what I did Mewo would be saved, but logic told me that wasn't probable. But now look, I did it! Being honest, I don't want to vote Kel or RW Basil, but as an influential person on my team I feel like I'll be publicly executed if I dont 
Yeah I don't want to vote out mewo but if i don't then RW Basil will probably be the next. . This is why voting systems are fucked
Yeah and its all kinda my fault aaaaaaaaa
Nah HS Basil was doomed anyways also I was the one who started the propaganda for basil
 TODAY IS GOOD DAY TO BE NOT DEAD /ref

LESSS GOO PEOPLE WE DID IT THE CAT SURVIVED AND IT SHALL WIN
MY BOY NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!t5\31hpy:2461
FUCK NO BASIL
NOOOOOOOO 
You monsters
You monsters! You wanted to vote out a cat over some unreal piece of a watermelon!
My friend are you part of the Business Cats? If so, our leader has decreed that maybe the real Bagel will have to go. Despite the misinformation spread by one of our ex-associate, we are in agreement with the Mari Clan. We shall rip the Bagel in two and equally share their bounty within the alliance.
No and I don’t really care, I’ve already voted and I’m sticking to it
Fair, fair. I am not one to dislike a man for having an opinion. However I shall warn you then. If you cross anyone who's apart of the Business Cats, the full might of four different Clans shall befall you. We shall show no mercy and when we enter your lands I hope we are friend rather than foe.
Eh, I’m gonna vote for who I wanna vote for, someone has to win
Then that someone shall be Mewo... I hope. Hopefully, y'know I'm honestly surprised we managed to get DW Basil out. But now I think we have some momentum and hopefully we can keep this going.
One more version of the overrated blonde haired sad boy to go
Dang it the cat won.. . 
Meow (We shall defeat and execute you all!)
Ah, yes, voter intimidation. The perfect way to get followers.
One down, one to go
NOOOOOOO!. . . . I am going to commit voter fraud to make sure basil stays in
HES OUT! HOLY SHIT
NOOOOOOO NOT THE SILLY BAGEL 
REAL BASIL! HAHAHAHAHAHA!
As someone on zaza I'm just glad the.. BUSINESS CATS ARE STILL STRONGER THAN EVER!
NOOOOO WHY BASIL!?
Guess mewo won, Im sticking with them, rip bagel. . * auby
RW Basil because idk 
How tf you guys vote out the best Basil?
Alliances and Capitalism. We ain't voting out the other one tho
SAVE RW BASIL!
We did it boys. Mission accomplished
Lmao y'all bout to kick both Basils out cause y'all know he's the most beloved characters. Y'all can huff all the copium you can with this poll
honestly basil is one of my lesser favorites, he's interesting but i much prefer some of the others
That makes no sense. If both Basils get voted, obviously it means they're not the most beloved. This is a majority vote afterall. Stop huffing so much copium yourself.
Actually we were able to vote him out by like making an allience between like 3 characters that were angry at him and like 2-3 other characters he is very well liked we just ganged up on him
I like cat, cat win.
We did it we got rid of 1 bagel now we go for the real one
Goodbye RW Basil…. . I have mixed emotions on him.
How did the best dream world character get removed first?
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Real world next lets goooo
Now out with the real one 🤭🤭
Bye Basil
WHY DOES r/antibasil EXIST!?
Might as well kick RW Basil out right now. Face it, RW Mari is going to win.
Nice 
Mind as well vote the other Basil too
This capitalist cat shall be destroyes for his horrible actions towards the bagel!!!!!
Never! The bagel will be gone! Send him to Blackspace for real this time!
if you dare i will turn you into a burgr
NOOOOO!!. . WE MUST SAVE BASIL!. . >!\*Que the Basil Battle song\*!<
How dare u
orange joe will help u, calm down and think logically everything's going to be okay
Well, my first option is officially dead, and the second probably too (RW BASIL), I hope at least Aubrey wins... Doesn't matter which one of them
Aubrey is protected by the group who kicked out HS Basil so don't worry
Gentlemen, we did it
Basil
Bagel will die!
kys guys 😊
fr fr ☺️
Ok 
GET RW BASIL OUT
RW Basil
Good
….it’s not that deep
Bully?. . Show me the bullying
Bullying is kind of a serious thing. . Do you really think all these posts are serious when they say "I'll ruin your life if you don't vote [character]" or something. . Like I do not think that anyone is gonna get bullied off the internet from this shit unless someone acts a bit stupid. . Unless you're referring to bullying the characters then sure it kinda is bullying but that doesn't count
 It is a silly character poll that almost every Fandom has. Anyone taking this that seriously and having arguments over it is being is goofy aah
I dont like bullying people who like basil tbh i just put my opinion
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Nice, one more to go.
KILL RW BASIL, NOW!!!!!!!!
KILL THE OTHER BASIL RIGHT FUCKING NOW  
NO AND YOU CQNNOT SPEAK TRASH BAG
 WHAT
welp basil you had a good run.
Whyyyyyy DW Bagel actually has something going for him unlike literally every other DW character besides omor
Come on r/antibasil , just one more to go!
Think I'm gonna vote Real World Hero this time because we lost Basil.
get the cat out
they helped in cutting basil open. . so they must pay >:3
Why not remove the other Basil while we are at it.
You will all suffer.
We already got the results for the winner silly
I'm sad now
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT THE SILLY NOOOOO 
Where are yall voting tho? I have no idea please tell me 😭😭😭
Op put out a comment with the link to the vote.
They really threw my boy basil out
NOOOOOOOO
WHI DID THIS I WILL KILL THEM IRL
Basil about to get picked like a vegetable now.
Kill the cat
NOOOOOO
We failed. . 
NOO NOT HS BASILL (older rw aubrey is my vote)
HOW COULD YOU GUYS 
No, RW Basil is still in and so is kel!!
We (or at least I) weren't planning on attacking the other Basil lol
Well Basil is still Basil so if he stays we win . . Jokes aside though vote  whoever you want so the poll isn’t messed up : 3
We have lost (╥\╥)
Also wondering why Omori isnt in the vote
OP literally forgot.
Rip basil 
Comrades, the Basil cause is not over yet! Everyone vote out RW Aubrey! Long live Basilkind! 
Never! I shall destroy him in the name of the Business Army Cats!
Well boys, it's official: democracy is a failure
You needed an Omori poll to realise that?
i can maybe understand voting out real world basil but WHY DREAMWORLD BASIL WHAT DID HE DOOO HE’S JUST A SWEET LITTLE. BOY

>!Sent to blackspace!<
Let's destroy the Headspace?
I hate that cat
NOOOOOOO
NOOOOOOO
NOOOOO BASIL MY SCRUNKLYYY WE WILL AVENGE YOU
RW BASIL PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST
NOOOOOO
RW Basil

We killed basil? That’s it  KILL THE CAT
MURDER THE CAT
Valid opinion
PLEASE GUYS DONT VOTE ME PLEASE I DONT WANT TO DIE PLEAS E GUYS PL
Nooo, dw Basil!! 
NO! not melon Bagel!
Y'all we should vote out headspace people BEFORE real world people, since headspace people are less liked by most.
GET THE OTHER ONE OUT NO BASIL IN MY WORLD LIVES (except stranger your cool)
Comrades,kill that capitalist pig. . He's screwed 
Day 2 of voting DW Kel. Not only is he pretty annoying, he also kicked Basil’s crown. How dare he.
Rw Basil. An eye for an eye
HELL YEAAAAH WE WIN THESE WOOOOOOO
lmao rip basil
WHO DID IT
Nooo, don't vote out RW basil, he's so cool!
I love how everyone in the comments forming alliances and civilisations to the point where we could play a game of risk, and I’m all for it.
Finally, the barely existing character is gone. Now all that is left is characters with actual story and feelings.... This will be a tough one.
NOO BASIL 
Noooooooooo Basillllll :(
Vote out the poll, just the whole thing
Istg if RW Basil gets voted out because you guys have something against him for no reason I will bang my head against the wall/srs. . WHAT DID THE FLOWER BOY EVER DO TO YOU!? . . Edit: If RW Basil gets out I will >!cosplay Mari!< (and not in a good way)
CAPITALISM WINS
Basil
no because I told myself that I was only going to get one character (basil) and now I’m conflicted because this vinyl is so cute 😭
i thought berly was a boy but also thought kim was a girl. something about her and basil is so girly but not girly at the same time
>something about her and basil is so girly but not girly at the same time. . True
Same
I also thought Basil was a girl
Surpisingly enough, I didn't lmao idk how
Basil Alpha
Basil’s favorite Christmas tree decoration
Basil’s big sister that he hanged out a lot with
Basil’s girlfriend
ummm...OH THATS BASIL
I'd like to thank you for not showing Basil, I'd be hella traumatised
. . Did this is 5 minute so it looks a bit better. . Basil looks realy nice like this
ok they don't look that bad tho u only removed one middle bang  all of them must be removed
Tulip or any of Basil’s skills, really. I know their uses are incredibly situational, but imagine your buddy is getting their ass handed to them, and then the guy who’s kicking their ass is surrounded by pretty flowers and shit, and then that guy just passes tf out. That strikes me as unreasonably funny.
Rose is perfect in that situation. Imagine a shit ton of roses just start wrapping around you and you suddenly feel weaker and your opponents cuts and bruises just immediately heal. Scary shit
Isn’t that literally just Poison Ivy’s (the villain from dc comics) power?
Yea
Neato
That some horror move shi-
Forgetting basil
oh nah basil called him bulbous 
That is a very well thought out and good point,. however . The first comment sounds funnier
yay
damn i never realized it was supposed to be stranger talking there but thats actually awesome    .     . it also makes me think, its good story design, because most people will remember the start of the game where basil calls him bulbous because it was funny, so it'll still be in the player's mind when it gets a twist later
And cute and perfect
Comfortable and modest.
I disagree again i think youre in the minority thinking that. ANd yes her whole mission in Omori is to keep you alive and guide you along. Shes literally telling you to go to Basils house in the end. Yes she forgot his name but she tells him straight up, go to that house. . . And the thing with The Stranger is something i still dont fully know. Idk if its Basil also being able to dream of a headspace and so hes able to enter headspace to guid sunny or its just his subconscious or its another entity that know his thoughts but im fairly certain it knows actual stuff from Basils mind or remembers quotes. It could just be sunnys mind remembering Basil telling him about the flowers. How could Sunny know what the flowers mean if he hadnt heard it from Basil at some point
It's a fair discussion on if the piano room scene was >!paranormal!< but the scenes in the dw very clearly are not.nit wouldn't make sense for Mari in the dw to be sentient but for basil/stranger to not be. Trying to make basil have psychic abilities where he can travel into people's dreams, or make it so there's some magical aspect just to make a ship canon would ruin a lot of the game. These are just normal kids. There's no hidden abilities they are hiding.
And im not trying to add these weird powers for Basil to have but there is a ton of weird somewhat paranormal shit that happens in the game. Daddy Long Legs and The Keeper of the Castle are 2 great examples, what are they and what really is being made in the gamem plus many people point to the similarity to Yummi Nikki cause i think theres some weird correlation but i cant remember so "dreamers" could have connections.
Those are not paranormal characters at all?
In what way tho?
>!In Black Space, Stranger tells Omori that on the same day Omori came into existence, he was "torn in half". One half is the Headspace Basil we know, the other half is Stranger, the part that wants to guide Sunny toward The Truth.!<    .     . >!Personally i think it's pretty obvious that Mari at the docks and at the piano are connected, either both of them are a ghost or both of them are part of Sunny's subconscious mind. I mean, the kid does hallucinate quite a lot, so i wouldn't throw it away.!<    .     . >!I think Sunny's mind uses images of Ghost Mari and Stranger as forces of good because, deep down, he knows they want him to be okay. He knows on some level that Mari would have forgiven him, and he believes Basil–at least this version of him, who has been sacrificed repeatedly in the name of hiding it away–would want him to realize the truth and face it.!<    .     . >!Interestingly, Basil in the real world doesn't even have the same drive to face The Truth that Stranger does. If you talk to Basil while he's in bed after nearly drowning, he says something like "There's no way out of this, is there?" indicating true hopelessness. However, Sunny imagines Stranger as someone who relentlessly pulls him toward the truth because Basil is the person he's doing this for, who he feels that he's letting down by not being strong enough to face the truth.!<     .     . u/Raw-Water
Yeah i agree with this and like basically everything that you said here. It makes sense. I also think Basil at least used to be that force like The Stranger is. The only reason he involved himself in what happened was to protect Sunny, he was trying to tell him everything is ok, saying theyre gonna face it all together, but yeah after Sunny abandons him i guess that light in Basil dimmed
Cons of chubby bf: none. . /ref
FAST AND BULBOUS
 That was in the past!. . My future is with Basil!. . 
Odd that this time, it's OMORI facing BASIL, unlike how basil described him always facing OMORI.
I didn't see a basil harem in blackspace I'm afraid so I'm just gonna have to continue feeling sorry for y'all 
not gonna take sides in ship wars because (ship wars cringe)  . however i will just, you know, lay out some things here. just a couple.   . . . sunflower shippers when:  . SUNNY fantasizes about murdering BASIL (in really gruesome ways) (he totally has no resentment towards BASIL at all)  . BASIL tries to pull a murder-suicide with SUNNY (romantic fr)  . BASIL teases SUNNY about having a crush on AUBREY (out of jealousy, which is why it's literally one of like 2 genuine smiles BASIL shows the entire game)  . SUNNY's idealized version of AUBREY in headspace has a crush on him
Looks like it's neck and neck between Mewo and DW Basil... I thought for sure Basil would be nowhere near the top even though he was my vote...
Meow (don't vote me out I'm just a cat, vote dw Basil)
Headspace Basil is currently losing
Only by 3 votes.
Mmmm bagel sweep 
why are you guys voting basil out wtf
I hate watermelons 😡
B-but flower boy!
Because Bagel is a crybaby flower boy.
Is that a bad thing on its own tho? Eh, I’m fine with whoever anyone wants to vote, it’s just I don’t agree with this reason 
Do people just not like feminine boys that happen to cry?? Like what
rude.. he’s way more than just that!
They tried to kill him, one of their Basil's was killed. We won't kill the other one tho don't worry guys
No. Kill the other one, too.. . 
It's an empty threat. Basil fans don't know how to use guns.
and girls, and enbies. We of the Bagel lovers don't discriminate, we just want your vote!
Get basil out
Im srry but basil
Headspace basil
Take out that flower boi HS!BASIL. . REAL WORLD BASIL SUPREMACY!!!
Save the flower boi
PEOPLE VOTE DW BASIL PLEEASE THE CAT NEEDS TO WIN
Dw Basil. . Nothing against him, just eh
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO... i vote for HS basil sorry
Headspace basil
Sorry Basil 
Basil
Vote for RW!BASIL, he is the worst compared to the others.
Basil, either one works.
Dreamworld basil
GET THE BAGEL OUT NOW!!! REVENGE FOR JAWSUM. . edit: headspace bagel. Reg bagel can stay a bit longer.
Only a bit… he needs to be next
Rw basil
Get that little cunt Basil outta here
BASIL
Now this is the part where it gets difficult. . So uh DW Basil I suppose
prolly dw basil, he's kinda changed in the dream
Going after Basil after what happened to jaws
What happened I’m out of the loop
Oh someone made a campaign for jaws going ‘vote not for me, vote for that Basil kid instead’ and made like jaws was presenting it. I thought it was cool cause I never seen people make little campaigns for these sorts things so I wanted to encourage it. Unfortunately it out a target on jaws for the Basil fans lmao.
I'm voting for anyone except for basil
Somebody kill basil, now
DW Basil has like 3% of the games screentime in normal route and a small character development on hikikomori route. He barely ever appears so I believe he should be voted out.
dw bagel. . LETS SEE SOME HEADS ROLL
Headspace Basil has gone missing! We have to find him!
Headspace basil
Headspace basil
Basil
We must keep silly bagel 
DW Basil has no screentime. Come on!
/u/CatFluff00. . if you dont vote for dw basil ill chop off your head
IM VOTIN IM VOTIN CHILL
RW Basil
Headspace Basil. He's only in the game for a small section, a few cutscenes, and parts of >!Blackspace!<, if I remember correctly. . . As soon as he goes missing, he's...kind of useless for the rest of the game. Doesn't have any main part until those events I listed happen.
DW basil tbh he annoys me
Bye bye headspace Basil
Dream World Basil didn’t have enough screen time for me to say he’s my favorite character. He was just important for the end and the start, which is kind of upsetting. So that’s my vote.
Out of these probably DW Basil.
DW basil
I’ve just come here to say to get dw basil OUT
I vote for Dw basil, he gotta go
Basil
TW: opinion but basil I NEED him GONE
idk if this was intentional but the korean sign that basil's holding up says 한국인 which means "korean person" instead of like the korean language i guess translating "korean" with google could do that but that kind of worries me about the quality of the korean translation then..
The Japanese says 日本 (japan) and not 日本語 (japanese) as well
Lit, like, all the photos are obviously photos but taken in their minds (maybe justificable with the photo of Basil's reflect) , its a very traumatising moment, they CANT get that images off their heads, like pictures, you cant change the things in there (Idk if im explaning it right, srry)
During Basil’s fight, he also says things like “Am I selfish for doing this ?” and “There’s no way out of this” so I don’t think that this is totally true.. But I think that’s one of the reasons why I think this fight is a really great scene, it could be read both ways : either Basil wanting to kill their Somethings, or him trying to commit murder suicide. . In my opinion it’s kind of a mix of both : Basil trying to get rid of their guilt, their Somethings, but knowing that the only way of doing that is death.
This is probably irrelevant now, but I think the "Am I selfish for doing this?" And "There’s no way out of this” Part could be referring to him planning on commiting suicide at the end of the game.. . Basil has gone through some pretty bad stuff story wise and like you said, he trying to get rid of the guilt, but since he doesn't want to tell anyone the truth, he believes suicide is his only way out. That's probably why he asks if he's selfish for doing it. Is he selfish for ending his life and leaving Sunny to bear the truth on his own? Is he selfish for abandoning his friends after everything that happened?. . I'm writing this at 4 AM so it probably isn't as coherent as I want it be, but what I'm trying to say is that, these dialogues could refer to Basil wanting to kill himself out of guilt rather than him wanting to take Sunny out with him.
I honestly think that's why the theory exists lol, everyone I've seen with this theory usually also hates Basil
>!That Basil is somehow terrible for how he handled the entire situation. I don’t know how most people think they would’ve reacted in a situation like that, but if I watched my best friend accidentally kill his sister, then have a hardcore panic attack when she wouldn’t wake up, I think the first thing my 12-year-old mind could come up with is how I was going to explain what happened. It would be hard to explain the bloody smashed violin, and Mari’s bloody head just by saying she fell down the stairs. So the next best option is to make it look like she did it herself. Of course hanging her is a horrible way to handle it, but a traumatized, scared, and desperate 12-year-old Basil isn’t thinking straight, and it’s not like Sunny is responsive; he’s just murdered his sister who he loves. Basil was absolutely tortured with guilt of what he did to the point that he kills himself in the “bad endings” of the game. Basil did not handle the situation well, but it’s not like he’s evil because he was trying to protect his best friend from the punishment from him killing his sister.!<
omori fans when a 12 year old boy does something terrible in the heat of the moment: there there, its alright, it was just an accident. . omori fans when another 12 year old boy does something terrible in the heat of the moment: you fucking donkey
Exactly
finally someone who sees if the way i do
Finally, some sensibility
I really like your take on how poorly Omori is interpreted by the community, especially when it comes to Basil. He’s one of my favorite characters of all time, and it makes me sad to see him boiled down to either “quirky two-faced murderer” or “soft pastel flower boy who did nothing wrong”.. . It’s the whole reason that I don’t interact with the fandom that much; it seems like people get too hung up on the small, literal details, and forget that this is a thematic story that uses weird symbolism to show the journey of overcoming your trauma. I wonder if it’s because the fandom skews towards being quite young (around middle school - early high school from what I’ve noticed, though feel free to correct me if I’m wrong).
that basil is a girl
Actually thought basil was a girl before I played the game lmao
That people who play Omori don't have functioning brains, like yeh I kin Basil my brain still works
I agree that BASIL isn't necessarily a bad friend. His actions were questionable for sure, but I'm willing to understand that at the end of the day he would still try to be a good friend if he could. As far as relationships go though... I'm less inclined to believe BASIL has suppressed romantic feelings for SUNNY, and more inclined to believe he's just severely mentally ill and developed some dependent personality disorder, which would explain more clearly why he's so clingy to SUNNY. They are canonically best friends after all, but I think that's really all there is, and it's just confused with having a very dependent personality. >!His RELEASE ENERGY with OMORI in BASIL RUSH is kinda sus though !<
Yeah.. I mean, there is more evidence than that. I think that OMOCAT wanted to plant the seeds for future relationships with the characters for the fan base to look into, but in reality, all of them are traumatized teens/young adult’s. But, if you wanna see the evidence that I use as a basis for my claim, there is this video.. [I don’t think Basil is Straight | Omori Analysis]() 
"Basil is feminine so he's gay" please stop he can also be bi or straight, or even be aro ace, stop saying everyone is gay in this game, they're minors they might not even know themselves their sexual orientation
That is NOT why people think Basil is gay lol
Huh? I'm not attacking people. I just think it's just a very popular HC and Basil could be other things, like aromantic, demiromantic, pan, etc. I feel it's pushed a little strongly. I don't mean to attack anybody. I'm sorry if I offended anyone. It's perfectly fine to think of him as gay. I just don't think it's set in stone for his character.
That Basil or Aubrey  are gay, lesbian or something else. There is no clear clue in game, that this characters are part of LGBTQT+ community. There is no dialogue, where Basil says :" I need to tell you something. I am gay".
Those are headcanons. They aren't canonically straight eather in the game.
Ah yes, because we all know characters have to state all of their identity and all the information about them for something to be a valid arc!. . I cant vouch for Auby being anything other than Auby, but RW basil's so obviously written to be gay in some way or another it's almost laughable you've brought this up.. . You wanna know why he doesnt say so? Because this is late 90s early 2000s, and while there wasnt really bigotry, there was extreme trepidation for LGBTQ as we werent even near fully accepted yet. This, plus basil's closed-off personality would make it really weird if he just said he was gay. This is literally a game about repression-
How is Basil written to be gay? I'm just curious, since I finished the game for the first time a couple of days ago and I never got the impression Basil was gay 
Yes, that's a main factor, but in his behaviour it isnt the ONLY factor.. . I never said sexuality was a main theme. The point is that it doesnt have to be a main theme to be written in there. The point is something doesnt have to be completely confirmed to be very plausible, such as why it's stupid to label Basil's queerness a "misconception".
It's headcanons, calm down. Only when they start trying to force it on others it's a problem, chill out 
basil is likely queer-coded though. I also didn't really think much about it at first, and just brushed off the shipping (especially with basil x sunny) as the fandom being the fandom, but this video changed my mind a bit .  . . (but obviously you are free to headcannon the characters any way you want, just without shitting on people who do think of them as lgbtq+ or going "um aktully there's no proof of that" on their posts, of course) :>
> (but obviously you are free to headcannon the characters any way you want, just without shitting on people who do think of them as lgbtq+ or going "um aktully there's no proof of that" on their posts, of course) :>. . Of course, this also applies to people going "um aktully basil is gay"...
Sure it's an overused joke. . But that does not mean that people think of Basil as a watermelon
K. . . Ima delet my comments before my karma go bye bye
the misconception that people think basil is a likable character
that basil is a uwu femboy baby when Omo cat had confirmed he isn't. he was born in the 90s not the 2000s. I know it's a head cannon for some of you guys but  ISNT TRANS NOR GAY! HE JUST PLANTS FLOWERS AND WEARS OVERALLS! it's not like he's like "IM TRANS AND GAY!!! UWUWUWUWUWUWU" I know this might get 64738946783 million hate comments but I'm being myself.
Basil:)
🇧🇷
That one lady who take care of Basil
wdym im reffing the pic of where basils pic got ruined by hector
Ah i see, i thought you literally called him a shit pic lol
That one character that people think is a femboy aka Basil
No
"Basil! stop making a noose with vines and help me give your grandmother dinner"
Polly?
Yes 😂
Honestly you could’ve guessed Basil and I would have been fine with it.
Good point
Nope! Basil :D. In the real world, when you interact with his Polaroid camera by his bed, it’ll mention it has a layer of dust on it
Ohh yeah, haven't thought about that one lol. That's quite creative, gg
Am I allowed to do another?
Yeah, sure !
If that's your way of saying basil, then yes
Bagel
🇧🇷
Wait so does like the community pronounce it Bra-zil or like bray-zil
Oh, i think most of them pronounce it Bra-zil. Also fun fact Bray-zil is close to how Brazil is spelled in my country
It's Polly!!! Basil's caretaker
Polly. . I just feel bad for her, being the caretaker of Basil and being unable to help him out when he is troubled.
She's often referred to as an angel.. . Honestly, that title sure fits her.  . She tries hard.
One of my saddest post game theories is >!after the nan dies in her care, a Basil that dies from suicide leads her to do the same herself!<
Basil of course!! 
basil (-:<<<<<< (yes, i know)
Know what?
Basil
Basil. . — Timely
WHY ARE THERE ONLY BASILS? 
Because Basils are superior beings \~!
Are there any gay characters in the game asides maybe possibly Basil?
Thats gus name lol?. . Although on a related note i headcanon that Basil's actual name is still Rowan, his concept name and the gang nicknamed him Basil becouse his first plant was a basil plant and he was obsessed with it, the same way Hero got his name from the Hero sandwich
It’s obviously because she is somewhat close to Basil, and if you paid any sort of attention to the game you would realize she is madly in love with him.
only near the end of the game in the real world, like on swings. in headspace, that is just an exaggeration, and probably just Omori's love for her actually
I’m not talking about Sunny, I’m talking about Aubrey’s very obvious crush on Basil, the blonde boy. Although I guess the confusion is understandable with the secret ending added in the new update revealing Sunny was just Basil’s imaginary friend and that Mari was Basil’s older sister.
oh im stupid, i thought u were another commenter. but on the other side, im not a shipper and dont rlly partake or agree with most fandom ships. most omori ones are actually ok.
*wait what update*
This is the obvious and only answer.  The profound and intense animosity exuded for Basil was clearly just typical tsundere behavior.. . Actually, I have a feeling that there was a manga focused on a relationship like that... It's a shame that I can't remember it.
a shame
it's okay basil that's an old picture..
explain this picture then... . 
just bros being bros! What could be better than that!?
we’re literally the same person, and no bro goes further than this.. 
ok maybe bros a little obsessive sometimes but it's alright... he's just.... passionate about friendship.......
other sunny.. you don’t realize that basil is just homosexual yet… 
well I knew THAT......... but...............me?....????? not that I CARE or anything....................... but..................................... me???????
trust me, atleast every single person in this sub reddit knows that basil is either gay for me and you.. or kel. or maybe kim or something, idk why they think kim is a good choice..
you're right, I guess. Also I'm pretty sure Kim is a lesbian so uhhh.
Basil Shapiro
That's exactly what I thought to.
*For some reason, Basil suddenly feels very nervous...
Emori AU by Shrimperini. . Basil: I guess, if it really means a lot to you, I’ll go to church with you…. . Aubrey: You will? Oh Basil, you’ll have fun, I promise! Thank you for trying!. . Basil: yeah… I guess…
emori AU??
Its an omori au on twitter where the omori characters are emo

Basil makes me laugh every time. That man ain't got nothing going on in his head and I love it.
Basil because it has a lot of work put onto it
Basil, there's a madness in his eyes, a bloodlust...
Basil for sure. His design is so much more complicated and different from the others, and his dead, dumb little eyes are impossible to resist
i love basil’s plushie, the little buttons on his overalls are so cute
Basil, hes so bright
Basil because he's so eye bleedingly pastel
I like Basil or Omori the most mainly just because I’d rather have RW versions of the rest of the cast, but those two are the most different from their counterparts
ur so right!
Basil
Basil, I love his silly ass face
Basil, ‘cause he is:. . Green (I love green). . Standing out but with happy colors. . And there’s a lotta work put into it!
basil. he’s colorful.
Basil cause basil best boi 
basil will always be my favorite no matter what form he is in :3
Bagel honestly just has the prettiest design. . (SHUT UP IM NOT BIAS I SWEAR)
Definitely Basil. He's very colorful, vibrant, and stands out in the collection. Basil just looks like a cute mascot of some platformer or brand.
Bagel, omor and mars idk why
Basil is my favorite because I think that the details were executed very well and the colors are the most appealing out of all the plushies. In-game I prefer the other characters, but I don't think they were translated into plush form very well
I've got all these little fucks and I like the basil one the best, despite him being my least favorite character out of the cast. His plushie is just very well detailed and looks much better than the others.. . Don't tell the others I said that, though. I'm not supposed to pick favorites.
basil because he fits in a blender very nicely
i love the OMORI one because it stands out (my favorite is BASIL)
basil bc his is so ugly but like in a nice way 
Basil, he stands out
basil. his color scheme is immaculate
Basil because I like the colors
basil looks goofy af . I love it
Basil because... Basil 
Basil because he's so colourful, I love his little overalls, and his face looks like his two brain cells just bumped together for the first time.
Basil bc his mouth looks like a bean
Basil
Basil because he's giving that look like when you're talking to someone and they're just staring off into space
Basil he looks funny lol
Bagel, just look at your goofy smile
basil because he looks dead inside
Basil, the color scheme is gorgeous so he really stands out
Basils is so cute 🥺
Omori, because he represents the game more, and Basil, because I like the colors.
I like basil’s plush because of the no thoughts head empty look on his face
I like basil because you can feel his eyes burning into your soul and reading your deepest darkest secreats
Basil, I love the eyes
Basil because he's the most colorful
Bagel!!! Because he looks super fucking nervous and ready to kill someone (secretly) :3
i rlly like all of them bc of the way they’re little faces look. they just don’t have any thoughts behind those faces, especially Basil
basil because he looks silly
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,542,777,083 comments, and only 292,094 of them were in alphabetical order.
Basil because he looks so goofy and silly to me 🏑
Basil, hes a little goober
Basil because he has little buttons!
Basil because he's so adorable to me
Basil he just looks so stupid and squishy
Basil isn't even on my top favorite characters, but he has the most detailed plushie and I like the colors.
basil because he looks so out of it and I love him
Basil bc it's basil
basil; hes the only one i can punt without remorse
Basil CUZ BASIL BEAT BOY
Basil because my mom said they look like a mii character. I think that everybody else looks more like a mii.
Basil.
Basil, i have the Basil plushie and it looks like theres just no thoughts in his brain.  . Omori is a strong contendor tho (wich i also own lol), he looks so menecing in a cute kinda way. Like uh-oh he about to commit arson, whoopsie daisy
Basil, he looks so derpy, like he is soo done and on his limit 
basil bc that is one of the most head-empty-feeling-deranged plushies i’ve ever seen in my life
Basil
Basil cuz his smile is goofy
Basil because of that nice turquoise colour scheme.
Basil ofc
Basil because I love Basil 
Basil.
Basil because i love Colorful plush
Basil’s, because it looks like he’s staring into your soul and about to commit 72 war crimes
Bagel Babil. Idk he looks the cutest. And the colors match rly well
Basil cause he looks the most derpy
basil. look at his little smile!!! tiny!!! baby!!!
Basil, because he's the most unique one
I love the bagel plush aka basil
basil because hes *green*, and cause hes very punchable for some reason.
Omori and Basil because they're both just adorable 
basil bc he looks like he's itching to tell me a riddle😭😭
Basil because I like watermelon
Basil, as a character Basil, is already a character I would protect with my life
There is no emotion behind basils eyes.
Basil because he looks like he doesn't know what's happening but still happy to be here
Basil, his light colored eyes make him look soulless and empty
basil bc i wanna squeeze his cheeks
   basil , bro is just silly. ( i wish i had one of these plushies , basil perhaps )
Basil, he's unique and just look at him, not a care in the world

nah the civil war would just have already happend and I'm betting the basil lover would have won
It's Basil *Lover* they literally have lover in the name, how are they gonna win a war?
Well when they love something or someone, some people are ready to kill for it should it be necessary
I'm pansexual, and I love Basil, so your not the only one lol
I’VE BEEN LOSING MY MIND OVER THIS FOR THE PAST WEEK. I HAVE NEVER EVEN EXPERIENCED (as far as I know, at least, because it turns out sometimes you just repress or forget them) ANYTHING GAY. BUT WHY FOR BASIL?! For all intents and purposes I’m straight, but why am I simping and obsessing over a fictional character? It’s not even like I wanna, y’know, birds and bees, but I get an overwhelming want to hug him and hold his hands. Help me out guys this game has broken me.
Same, but in a platonic way. I want to hug them all so badly
femboy 
Find ways to brutally murder and blend the flower boi, it will help
Basil is just an adorable little flower boy, we all love him 
I'm a guy, blonde, green eyes and have Basil merch does that count 
Basil with the basil shirt
When I first saw basil, that's when I decided to say I was heteroflexible instead of just straight. There are exceptions and basil was one of the *very* few.
Basil was your awakening 
I’m a bi girl and I love my little cute baby Basil boy
Can confirm. I am straight, but basil tho
If basil were real you’d have no fucking idea he was real because of the incredibly low chance that he was born in a place where he would end up meeting you
Isn't basil a minor... *dials the fbi*
Ah good
Real talk: basil actually did help me come to terms with my sexuality! In some weird way.
The average basil enjoyer 
Man this is so embarrassing to say but at first time i saw basil i thought he was a girl
Same
Basil made me gay. he was the first fictional guy where i was like “Woah” and my cheeks turned red i forgot what thats called
That's called going "woah" and having your cheeks turn red when you become gay after seeing fluffy flower boys
I believe in Basil supremacy
If Basil existed but was somehow straight I'd become trans for him
Basil is the one who inspired me to get a Polaroid camera
I think Basil has been part of a bi awakening.  That sounds like me like 3 months ago.
There are two basil's inside of you. You are a a blender
most sane basil simp
I find your assertion that Basil being suicidal and depressed means he’s gay to be highly concerning
I'm transfem but yeah I stan basil
I’m Bi, blond, blue eyes, and have a lot of plants. If I grow out my hair, I think I could pull off being the Basil in a relationship(just tall sadly)
Omg if you look like him😊
Sorta. This basil is just tall and short hair
No you’re not. Basil’s adorable so I would hug him if I saw him in real life. :3
(not saying that basil is a femboy)
Basil is the most adorable thing I’ve ever seen honest to damn god
Basil is so cute
basil in a maid costume was the cutest thing i've ever seen
I remember when I first started watching a playthrough I thought Basil was a girl and when they referred to him with male pronouns, I thought it was a typo(I also thought Omori was a very small game, max 3 hours of playtime).
could not agree more. I'm a straight man but I'd make an exception for Basil.
i am gay BUT basil is an asshole that hung his bestfriends sister so r/antibasil is where i live
I keep telling myself that Basil is an exeption it works.
Dude he is [insert Basil age]
basil fans are usually pretty nice 👍

Basil because i’m Basil.
Omori and Basil :)

basil for sure. as someone with a lot of trauma who’s usually seen by friends as just an uwu soft boy, i relate to him WAY too much🥲
Bagel. He is kinda cute
And why is it Basil

actually his real name is Ocimum Basilicum
just wait until you hear about the name Basil
And  name is Basileios Porphyrogennetos Macedonian, basileus and autocrat of the romans
Basil's real name is Basileios Porphyrogennetos ho Boulgaroktónos
>!Basil may not be the best example, given what happens to him at the start of the game.!<
how do you get that basil nametag? (I'm very dumb please don't answer with long words)
Idk how to do this on a computer but if you’re on mobile: go to the subreddit’s page, tap on the three dots next to the search bar, and choose “Change user flair”
yea I played it on release because of reddit. just like Edge of Eternity now. We called the eye and the source of trauma, what omori did (but not why) and that basil took a picture or saw, but not the rest.... .  none of us knew what to expect. oof. my tear ducts. I have never cried so much in front of others but I had to finish and it was....quite and experience. If I never stream again I will still always remember that journey we had.
sunny and basil also wear identical shirts (only difference being used that basils is green). . i don’t personally think it’s that deep but it is a cool little detail
Its because there is between a connection to both. >!Which in fact that Basil is involved with Mari's death, that's why Basil did the same thing as Sunny did by being a shut-in person.!< (Day 3 spoilers)
No worries! Be sure to wish Bagel a happy birthday

No it's Basil as in Basil from Fawlty tower's
No one I've ever met from the US has ever added a random Y into Basil
odd, everyone i know pronounces it bay-sil
Pronunciation and spelling are different, we’re talking about bāsil versus basil (short vowel)
From the US here, I've only ever heard bay-sil. . Just googled it to see if I'm crazy and Cambridge Dictionary also says US pronunciation is bay-sil while UK pronunciation is bah-sil
I live in the South East and if someone said BAH-zull, then they'd get made fun of so hard.. . Some people say BAY-zull, deal with it.
How is any part of apple pronounced like "baysil"?? Ayple? Apple doesn't have a long sound
Maybe some people pronounce it that way but whenever I've heard people say it baysil they tend to put more emphasis on that imaginary Y instead of just using a long A sound
Where do you think the "Bagel" meme came from? It's because they are pronounced similarly, as can be shown in the international phonetic alphabet spellings of basil <beɪ zəl> and bagel <beɪ gəl>.
Oh, but we say baaaahhhh gull
Wait which character is he named after? I thought it was just a plant pun. The two Basils I can think of off the top of my head (Dorian Gray and Indiana Jones) very much don’t fit his personality so idk
Basil from Fawlty Towers, a classic British comedy. . Polly is also a character from it.
Oh I never even thought of that, I love that show lmao
it’s mostly an american vs european thing, in (most of) europe the plant “basil” is pronounced bah-sil, along with the name. whereas in america the name can be bah-sil OR bay-sil, and the plant is always bay-sil. so it depends who you ask. . . personally i say “bah-zul” because i have a horrific scottish accent
idk what y'all r saying basil for.. it's obviously basil and that's the only way to say it 
BAY SIL BASIL
It's Basil like it's basalt
Basilico
I always pronounce Basil like how you pronounce Brazil.
Basil
My name (which is Basil) is pronounced bah-zeal
its basil
It's totally basil not basil like who would say basil, you would have to be stupid to say basil so just say basil.
I’ve always pronounced “Basil” as bay-zul. My friend calls him Buh-seel
It's bagel.yall dumb as hell
I like bay-sul more because bah-sul just sounds weird when you speak it out but hey bagel is good too
As a name Basil is pronounced the British English way of pronouncing basil. Like... Bazzle.
Basil is bae-sil
I mean presumably Basil is a nickname in-universe and his real name is Basily or Vasily, so Bah. but out-of-universe his name is Basil like the plant bc he's a plant boy so Bay.. . swings both ways! (like Basil back when you could choose Sunny's gender lmao)
I think usually (at least for my American counterparts) the herb is pronounced bay-sil and the name is pronounced Bah-sil (Like Basil in Indiana Jones or the movie adaptation(s) of Portrait of Dorian Gray (the pronunciation is obviously not stated in the book lmao) but there’s different pronunciations in different places I suppose.
its pronounced Basil
Bas-il is a man’s name, like Basil of Baker Street. . . bays-ul is the herb.
Whoop-de-dee-doo, Basil.
Baiysoul. Basil
Basilikum
Basil is from the Latin, so short a.
I pronounce the plant bahzil but the bagel as bayzil
However the fuck you pronounce Basil
I personally say it like I've said the plant's name; Bay-zil (I say the "s" a bit "z" esque). . I have heard others pronounce it like Bah-sil, though(specifically the name Basil when in reference to the actor Basil Rathborne)
I’m Aussie so technically I’m supposed to be pronouncing basil “bazzle”, but I genuinely think it sounds stupid so I say “bay-sil”
But realistically, It would be Bay-Sul because he was named after the herb, Basil, as shown later in the game
Basilisk
Personally i say Bah-sil since "basil" is written exactly like the name in arabic "باسل" (bāsil), i just find it ironic since it means "brave/fearless" so i've been calling him that since the beginning.
Rhymes with bagel, according to the memes
Its Basil you silly goose
Basil
Bay-sul. This is just my personal opinion however, this is how I've always read Basil's name.. . When I read bah-sul, I thought of that one scene in Austin Powers where Austin says "bah-sul" and tbh it sounds posh and good on paper. Definitely not American sounding, however. Then again, I grew up in south Texas, I've always heard people call Basil (when people discuss seasonings) "Bay-sul", so it just stuck.
Basil is a guy’s name. Basil is an herb.  Herb is also a guy’s name.
What? It’s bagel right? 
Basil's name is based off of the flower, Basil. So its likely pronounced as "Bah-zil". But I personally pronounce it as "Bay-sil" because it slides off the tounge easier.
As a Basil, I assure you it's pronounced Basil.
I’ve always pronounced Basil as Bay-sil. No, not bay-sul. Bay-sil.
Bagel
Basil. If you say baah-sul get OUT
Basil
pronounce basil the same way as the actual garnish
It's either Basilico or Brasil
Basil
basil
how do you say "basil," the herb, in your country? say it like that. but considering it was developed in the US, if you want to get hypertechnical, they probably envisioned it as "BAY-zul"
I think Basil is pronounced Bay-sul
bay-zil, is that not how you pronounce basil????????
Bay-sul that's how I say Basil
 I thought it was basil cuz he likes plants n stuff
It’s obviously Basil
Im confident It Is "Bah-seel" like the name, rather than the plant.. Or who knows for all we know It could be a nickname of Basilio... Wait thats a neat headcanon.
it's probably basil
Basilyo (Bah-seal-yo)
>!like basil!<
Bah-sil is how it’s typically pronounced in European countries like Britain. Whereas Bay-sil is a more American pronunciation. As someone named Basil and is American, I prefer the second one. Neither are right, all words are made up anyway
FUCKING DAMNIT I'M BRITISH FUCKKK
get better soon 😔
Bri'ish?
Br'i'sh 💀
Woulcha laik some wat'ah with you' tea™
My condolences

you have my condolences...
Holy shit, basil irl

holy fuck another American named basil, my family and I have always pronounced it bah-sil though.
In muslim nations, its called BAH-zil or bah-SEL.
bagel
Carb boy
I’m gonna upvote that, but I want you to know that I had to take a pause just to comprehend the immense amounts of unbridled rage I felt when I read that. Congratulations, good sir or madam.. . - Sincerely, that one guy on the Internet that habitually corrects people’s spelling online for no justifiable reason.
nagelbett
I also have some confusion on how to pronounce his name. I just say his name like how I would say the plant Basil… Bay-zl
Same, I’ve never seen someone actually pronounce it “bahsil” outside of one or two videos. Everyone I know pronounces it Baysil like the plant.
Where I live "Bahsil" is a name so initially I pronounced it like that till I saw a video haha
I’m guessing you live in America- the plant in the UK is pronounced bah-sil
Nah, I’m actually European.
oh youre an american who ignores the rest of the world.
Same
Bay-sil gang
Bay-sil bay-sil

Bail
bal. . bal is life
Basil is obviously a herb. In America the herb is pronounced bay-sil. In the UK it’s pronounced bah-sil. So the correct pronunciation is just based on where you live I guess.
bay-sil is the american pronunciation, bah-sil is the british pronunciation
Brazil
Bah-sil is how I say it
Same, surprised to see how many say bay-sil.
well there are more north americans here and the creator is american so it's not that surprising
I switch between them at complete random. The two pronunciations are both correct, and may be used interchangeably imo.
Bah-sil cuz in my mother language, basil (the plant) is Βασιλικός (vah-si-li-kos)
I wasn't expecting to find a Greek person on this subreddit ( I am Greek too)
I say Bald-sil
Are you thinking about something dirty?? or you are just thinking about why basil is blushing??
The better question is where are his arms goin?
Iike Brasil without the r

"The Source is that I made it all the fuck up!"
Very nice argument senator
🧐

You pronounce it the same way you pronounce the plant
I’m Canadian, with a half British family, and I pronounce it as bay-sil
Historically it would normally be bah-sil but yes I’m fairly sure it is supposed to be pronounced bay-sil
i’ve always heard and said bay-sil but both work just fine, as long as you’re understood i don’t think it matters
I knew it was bay-sil, but because of when I started the game the YouTuber I watched pronounced it bah-sil
I used to say Buh-zil (cos I didn't know how to pronounce it and just assumed it was similar to Brazil's pronunciation), but I later realized that was so wrong
Art sauce?
i think the artists Instagram is @inuinu6 . i found the pic on pinterest .
I say it how merg says it
Brazil
Welp Basil is an name that's comes from old french so I'll go with Bah-zil. Also apparently the name basil apparently meant king. The fact it's the same name as an herb is coincidental.
the way you say it is actually right. you can look it up, the name Basil is not American, which is why it is not pronounced the same as the herb, pronounced bay-sil, it's pronounced in its own way, (bah-sil.)
I say bah-sil because i think it sounds cuter and also because the first time i heard the name pronounced it was pronounced that way and it stuck
It's bay-sul. Yes I will die on this hill.
bazyl
Bay-sil
Bey zel, because I heared people say it like that. Before playing OMORI I pronounced it Bah zil
Bay-sil
I pronounce it like baa-zil
im reasonably certain bah-sil is the british pronunciation, it probably sounds more correct to you because you usually hear that name in that context. i think you’d pronounce it bay-sil in an american accent.. so i guess both are correct since the game doesn’t have voice acting
Bay-zil
my names basil, and while its supposed to be pronounced bah-sil, literally everybody says bay-sil
Bay-sil.
I say bah-sil, because there is no y in the word and i do not care
I say bay-zul
i say bah-sil
[dictionary.com]() page for the word basil says either, so say it how you want
Bra-zil
I also noticed some people pronounce it bay-sil and others bay-zil when I lived on a street of that name. I'm a filthy bay-zil-er.
He-dead
bah-zel
You know the Byzantine emperor Basil? I pronounce it like how you pronounce that dudes name
bus-eel
Basil is a plant and the correct pronunciation of it is Bay-sil
I say "bay-zil" because that's how I pronounce the plant.
i have a friend whose name is pronounced bah-sil so that’s what i end up calling basil from omori too
Basil isn’t British so it’s like the plant.
Like the seasoning, Bay-Sil
i say bay-zul
I pronounce it like nitro rad does since that was my first exposure to the game.
Brasil without the r sound so....buh-zil?
Ocimum basilicum
I always just imagined he has a British accent and pronounced it bah-sil
Buh-sill 😔
Bah-sil ftw
correct way is bah-sil i will not be taking any more suggestions
Bah-sil
It’s pronounced the same way as the plant
I pronounce it bay-sil, because it's closer to bagel, and that's a funni name for him
I say bay-sil. Like the seasoning. Which gives me a lot of seasoning puns for him.
you're pronouncing it right
Did you first hear it pronounced watching British cooking shows?
no ive only watched british baking shows and have no memory of hearing them say basil. i forgot how to say basil when i saw the word in the game so i just guessed it would be pronounced bah-sil.
BAHsillllllllllllllllllllllll
Bae zill
I say both because my girlfriend says Bay-sil and I used to only say Bah-sil
Brazil
bal
Bay-sil because that's how I pronounce the word basil in cooking. I'm American btw
Brazil
Americans say it like bay-zil In Europe it’s pronounced bah-sil
Bay-sil
I say Bah-sil too. I believe it is casually Bay-sil but idm
Bay-sil
bay-sil
Ew Americans call him baysil? The horror
midsil
Depends on the day
I'm Australian and the way most people pronounce it here is like "bazzle"
It's Bay-sil, you know like the plant
Definitely bay-sil imo
Bah-zil. . Though, to be fair, I'm from the UK. Idk if other countries have a separate pronunciation for the name vs the herb, but here it's bah-zil for both (well, maybe a bit more like bah-zuhl.)
what is this picture. why is his face melting
 Ba-ll
/ˈbæzəl/
I say bay-zul
Baysil
I’m weird, I pronounce the leaf as bay-zl but I pronounce his name as Ba-zil
Bah-sil is how Gordon Ramsay would pronounce it.
Bay-sil, I've only ever heard someone call him bah-sil once on a Youtube video so you're all good. There's also his nickname bagel, lol
Bah-sil
it's pronounced differently in england and america. . considering the dev has no affiliation with britain, I call him bay-sil, despite the fact that I, a british person, call the herb itself bah-sil
I pronounce it “Bah-sil” since I’m from New Zealand, it all just depends on where you’re from and your preference. Neither is a weird way to say it.
It’s actually pronounced bagel
I'm Australian, so I always read it as bah-sil while playing the game. Imagine the whiplash I got when I heard Omo-cat pronounce it bay-sil. First time I'd heard it pronounced that way.
I say bah-sil, bay-sil doesn't sit right with me idk why
I say Bah-zil on purpose to piss people off. But also because I like that pronunciation better
I’ve always said bay sil but idk
just call it bah-ee-sil
i normally say bah-sil, but sometimes when referring to basil the character form the indie game Omori, i say it bay-sil, because sometimes i think it sounds a bit better that way . . (i remember when i first heard someone say it bay-sil, i was so confused lmao)
Bay zil that's how I say it, like the plant
I like "bah-sil" but I'm not British and therefore default to "bay-sil".  ... . it's easier for phoneme editing in vocal synths
bah zil . 'bad' (without the d sound) zil
The face in that photo already gave me a certain unclean imagination even I can't comprehend
Babil
Bae sí
base sole
Pretty sure both works…
Bah-sil because his name makes me think of Brasil
Something about this thats interesting is while it's pronounced differently in the Americas and in Europe, I wonder if there's only one correct way to pronounce his name because it's... his name?
I say it bra-sil totally corrct
It's like how you pronounce the plant by the same name
Brazil
It's pronounced Basil.
Like the plant
Flower
i'm called him be-sir or gayass
I say both
I say it how the British folks say Basil. Bah-sil.
bail
B(r)a-zil
Basel/basil is actually a really popular Arabic name that means “brave” so maybe…it’s written "باسل" check google translate for the pronunciation
I think it depends where you're from! A lot of Americans pronounce it bay-zil but I'm Australian and pronounce it "ba-zil" like bat without the T. But unfortunately ever since I watched my favourite streamer play it, I keep saying "bay-zil" even though it feels wrong and I hate it
I typically pronounce basil's name either ba-zil or brazil
I pronounce it as bay-sil. Bah-sil just sounds like someone saying the name in a funny way.
İt really doesnt matter ig. İ know some youtubers saying Buh-zil
I say BaSell because its the arabic way of saying it and it feels comfy,. . Occasionally i say Buh-Sul which is difficult to pronounce in English but its arabic for onion بصل
Bae-silee
Similar to Brazil but no r and an s instead of z
I pronounced it bah-sil at first, but later started pronouncing it as bay-sil.
i say bah-sil too, its the way we say things in my country
Why is his face melting
Bay-sil
brazil
Ba sil
If you're normal: Bay-sil. . If you're a psychopath: Bah-sil or Ba-sil. . And if you're a meme lord: Bagel or Brazil
Bae-sil
Bold of you to assume I can speak right.. . I just say bass-zil.
ba-seel. Basil
I personally pronunce it as Bay-sil.
Am british, grew up with shows like Basil Brush so for me its always been Bah-sil. I think its generally Bah-sil if you're British and Bay-sil if youre American.. . Correct me if im wrong but isn't Basil a rarer name in America than it is in Britain?
How to Ь in english?
I'm weird; I pronounce the name "bah-sil" but the plant "bay-sil".
bay-sil, like the food spice, basil leaves
Just pronounce the name however you would pronounce the herb
i think bay-sil is the canon pronounciation.
I Just say Basil. Just like that
I say bay-sil but im pretty sure both ones are correct since it’s only the accent difference
Gary
pretty sure the way you pronounce "basil" is different depending on where you live
i live in europe so ive always pronounced it "bah-sil"
In OMOCAT’s livestream for Basil’s birthday, she pronounces his name as “Bay-sil.” I don’t think it matters, but “bay-sil” is the more accurate pronunciation for Basil (when referring to him specifically).
I'm pronouncing his name like Bezil or something like that
bee-zile
I pronounce it like you. It sounds better in my opinion. More like a name and less like 🌱 basil. But it's just peronal preference, most people pronounce it bay-sil.
Bay-sil
I call him basli for some reason
it's bah-sil like the god damn plant. . Edit: apparently it's pronounced differently in different places
Bay-sil is how you're supposed to say the herb that his name is based off of so I think you would say it like that
basically “bah-sil” is the british way of saying it while “bay-sil” is the american way. I watched a youtuber called the gaming beaver when I was little and he had a dog named basil, so I got used to hearing “bah-sil” especially as a name. personally I like the sound of “bah-sil” better, especially as a name but I understand “bay-sil”. also if you’re looking for an “official” version of the pronunciation, omocat says “bay-sil”.
It's actually pronounced "gay-sil"
Bay-sil
I just read it as "Basil" and sometimes be-sil
And rarely bei-sil
i say Bah-sil, it's not weird
Due to me being raised by my british step-dad and The Great Mouse Detective being one of my favorite disney films, I've always said Bah-sil, not bay-sol.
The herb/plant "basil" is pronounced "Baysil" in US english and "Bahsil" in UK english. However, the name should be pronounced more like the herb in UK english, because the origin is greek ("Vasil/Vasyl") and has nothing to do with the plant, as it means "Royal". The name entered via greek or latin (maybe even spanish), where "a" is pronounced "Ah" and not "Ay". And since the closest sound we have in english similar to greek "a" is "ah", that's became the correct way to pronounce it. But since the author of Omori clearly showed us Basil is a flower kind of guy, maybe the herb was an inspiration, so it could be pronounced either way. Although, it would technically be grammatically correct only to call him Bahsil, if we're speaking real, non-fictional names and their origins
i guess like you would say basil?
Bagel
Im a native spanish speaker so i pronunce it ba-sil like in the word Brazil
Bay-zl
Basil (Baseel). Like saying "Brazil", without the "R".
ba-sil
OMOCAT pronounced it bay-sil (bay-zil?) in her stream. That's also the version more used in America and the game definitely takes place in America; you can tell by the suburbs, the slang used, and the general vibe. Plus saying it that way sounds more soothing (I think), which is fitting for Basil.
i just call him a herb 😭
Basil is Bay-sil in America and Bah-sil in Europe. Personally, I use Bah-sil as the person and Bay-sil as the plant.
Bah-sil is the correct way however I pronounce it tay-stee l-eef-ee
I call him "Buh-sil". My friends have told me I'm wrong, but I've been calling him this the entire I've been playing, so it would be too hard to change now. Also I like "Buh-sil" more anyway.
My dad always told us it was named after a dude named Basil then I married an English man, and it fked up my head after my dad died and I got a divorce. I feel stupid when I say it.
i'm british but i pronounce basil as bay-sil but for the herb i pronounce it bah-sil
My uncle was called Basil.  Or Baz for short. Ba zil is how I pronounce it and always have done. Bay zil seems so wrong. But a lot of American pronounced words grate on my ears.
My fiancé pronounces it like you! 👍
Americans are the ones being weird , you’re saying it correctly
The correct pronunciation is basil not baysil. There is no reason for the first vowel to be lengthened, and if you were taught different, you were taught wrong.
According to English phonetics, a vowel, followed by a consonant, followed by a vowel, makes the first vowel long and the second vowel short. So strictly speaking, according to phonics, it should be pronounced Bāsil, not Băsil. *Should* being the operative word.
nah i say it like bah sil
Buh-Sill
It's Bay-sil. Anything else is objectively wrong.. Edit: I should note that I'm kidding lol.
Actually the objectively correct pronunciation is “ray-shio”
lol no
Bay-zil.
Transil
well here's some spoilers that helped me determine how it should be said (it's spoiler tagged): >!based on the building architecture, the characters there, location, the church  and how characters act, it seems reasonable to guess that Omori is in America in the real world segments, so saying Basil like bay-sil would be correct, if they were in a european country then Bah-sil would be correct.!<
I will accept no other pronunciation other than Baesil
It should be "bah-sil" as a name, but I always pronounced it "bay-sil", backed up by the scene in Humphrey >!when the group has forgotten about Basil and they see the basil plant and say it sounds familiar, and that's how I pronounce the name of the plant!<
It's my name and I prononcé it Bah-sil, but that doesn't matter because I'm French
To be honest i thought his name was bagel and was a her
Basil obviously
I’ve always thought of basil as seeming like he could have BPD.
Basil def got deep attachment issues probably thanks to his parents ditching him
Basil. My poor baby is too precious to be this traumatized.
Basil, >!since in one of the endings he kills!< himself.. (Plus ofc other reasons)
It’s implied basil kills himself in most endings
There is one ending where he kills himself. And you get it if you decided to not check on basil and go back to sleep
Bro really just repeated it without the spoiler
I dont defend him but man you gotta be very reckless to consume a games content without having finished it. Its a guaranteed massive spoiler
Im stoopid idk how use spoiler lol
the baby... the skrunkly...... i love him he needs therapy!!
Agree. He can't help himself  Poor Basil
Basil!! He’s so deeply traumatized from the events, and was bullied in top of that… he has so many issues poor man
i would probably give it to basil
Basil. In every ending but the good(and true) ending he either kills himself or it’s heavily implied that he killed himself. So in my opinion he needs the most therapy out of them all. Aubrey has had an extremely shitty life at times sure but she has an entire friend groups worth of support. Hero went through his depressive state but overcame it for the most part and Kel simply wouldn’t commit suicide as that’s just not who he is. . Meanwhile Basil kills himself in all endings but the good/true ending. When leaving to move away at the end of Hikki you hear police sirens, or ambulance sirens I’d imagine, one can only assume Basil is the reason and he’s taken his own life. In the neutral ending we see his corpse after he commits suicide because we chose not to save his life. In the bad ending let’s be honest, he’s in the hospital sure, but Sunny just killed himself, as soon as Basil figures that out at one point or another he’s gonna try and follow him because the entire reason he commits suicide in the first place is because he doesn’t wanna be the only one holding the guilt of the truth.. . Meanwhile Sunny only kills himself in about 2 endings I think? Bad ending and then whichever ending stabbing himself in his sleep is. But even then at those points I don’t believe it’s Sunny in control of his own actions either. Omori is practically just murdering him.. . So overall, Basil practically needs that therapy for life.
Basil easy
besides sunny probably basil. hes been thru a fuck ton. not just the whole deal with mari, but aubrey and her gang bullying him for 5 years, social isolation, his own version of 'something' the guilt, the trauma, his parents apparently not even being around for him, his grandma, who seems to be his only consistent adult support figure, dying. i feel awful for basil.
Basil
Basil, ofc 
Basil, because I like Basil...but the more sensible option would be Aubrey because she is poor, and it seems that Basil's parents are well off
Inside the omor sub are two wolves, one loves basil whilst the other hates him
What about the neutral ones?
They dont exist, take the stairpill
𝐈’𝐦 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐬

basil
basil😭
Basil! Basil needs the therapy! Maybe I’m just projecting because I’m so much like him and can’t afford or muster the courage to go to therapy myself, but Basil most definitely needs some therapy!!!
Basil
Kel - no. He is still quite happy and probably needs it the least. . Hero - no. He is also very happy and only becomes sad when a subject about Mari comes up. . Sunny - no his case is very treatable as we see later on it's just a lot to heal. . The two that is the hardest to decide. Best boy Basil and best girl Aubrey. . Basil - yes. Basil is a very hurt person and suffers from PTSD, adjustment disorder, attachment issues, anxiety, low self esteem, and can be suicidal. We find out he doesn't live with his parents and loses his grandma later on in the game so this a prime choice. . Aubrey - no. Aubrey doesn't suffer from trauma or as much as basil but has a very complex problem I can't explain and has lost her dad which is pretty bad. Not to mention that she had a lot of changes since Mari died
Poor baby boi Basil. Save my mans.
I would give it to basil, and I will attempt to kick aubery in the shins on my way out
Bagel boy needs it
basil
Basil kinda went murder suicide thing, I’d say him. Kel handled the whole thing surprisingly well, Hero went into a year long depression, Aubrey became a delinquent, and sunny just stopped living for 4 years. Aside from Aubrey, basil was the only one who was really dangerous, basil explosively so.
oh my god basil holy shit that dude needs to be institutionalized
Basil because if he doesn’t get serious therapy post-game I hate him <33
The whole gang, except Basil, fuck Basil
&#x200B;. . 
Basil. Easy.
Mine would be Basil because he's such a good flower boy
Citizenship of any industrialized nation other than the US? Basil.
basil tbh 🙁
Basil. He needs it more imo.
Definitely basil. He’s the one who seems to have taken it the worst
probably giving it to basil, it doesnt seem like hes doing too hot
basil needs it the most. So delicate, fragile, and all alone.
Definitely Basil
Possibly basil, because number 1. When he was 12, he got the idea to hang a body to fake a suicide to not get in trouble, which is exactly what I would do, and I need therapy, meaning basil would to. Number 2. I forgot
Basil
Basil my man.
Basil
Well, is this pre >!good ending!< or post >!good ending!<? If it's post then absolutely Hero, because I feel like learning that would set him off like when the event first happened, Kel and Aubrey would probably be pretty resentful initially, and Basil already knows. However, if it's pre, then 100% my poor boy, Basil. Sunny seems to be more on the recovery path compared to Basil, and everyone else while still being distraught, have recovered significantly more (imo) compared to Sunny or Basil.
Give the card to basil and pay for the rest
Let me put it this way. . 
People can have there opinions but also every opinion except basil is the best character is wrong 
I totally agree 
Agree
. . Nuh uh
Goes hard

I used to hate on him for no reason 😭. I don't know why 😔
Don’t worry, I loved him since the headspace part and immediately knew he was my favorite when I saw his real world version.. . Depressed Babil is best Babil 
Bagel is the best
Would you say he’s your, ‘Everything’ Bagel??
That joke was horrible and I absolutely love it, you’re brillisnt

You aren't the only one who likes Basil
He's my favorite too!
Basil is literally the best
Basil is the best kel is second but basil will always be on top
look at my flair and pfp. basil isnt my favorite, hes my life.
I genuinely thought Basil was the fan favorite before playing the game. I was very surprised to know he's hated by what seems to be the majority of players.
Yo, listen up, my dude. I ain't gonna sugarcoat it for ya. Your obsession with Basil is straight-up whack, and it's making me wonder if you got some screws loose  I mean, come on, Basil, he's all gloomy and mopey  like a never-ending rain cloud followin' him everywhere. And don't even get me started on his constant need for attention and sympathy. It's like he's beggin' for a pity party 24/7.. . Now, if you wanna talk about some legit cooler characters from OMORI, lemme put you on game. Aubrey  she's got that fierce attitude and don't take no crap from nobody. Hero   .  he's the reliable and level-headed homie, always keepin' things in check. And then you got Sunny  himself, man, he's mysterious and deep, like a hidden gem waitin' to be discovered. Trust me, my dude, there's a whole crew of characters who bring way more flavor to the table.
Ngl Basil had the most brilliant idea to use a >!rope!< 
I love him sooo much! I would give him the whole world-
basil is the best boy
I love babel, I draw him alot
Love Babil, he deserved better

Basil is epic, thank God I'm not the only one either, I have a friend who likes him too

I loved Basil, Aubrey was my personal favorite but Basil was either second or third for me him and KEL fight for second, a great character though!
I love all the Headspace/Faraway town kids in my own way, but Basil has a very important place in my heart.

Basil is best boi and anyone who thinks otherwise isn't an Omori fan
Too adorable to not be your favorite character, if anyone says otherwise, they either aren't an OMORI fan or they're a cop.

YOU HAVE A BASIL TATTOO-
haha my partner does >:D it's absolutely adorable
Basil is the best
wait I think that's basil
I have a lot to add to this but too lazy so I'll just write about the ✨***Basil Hair✨***  . . . Ahem. **Have you noticed** that Basils hair in the dialogue icon is freaking white??  and, in one of the animations,  blue???  and, in the pixel sprite, green???? >!That's not all, bcs for some reason, RW Basil's hair is... yellow??!!! !<  . >!And when there suddenly appears and disappears a black all-over Basil I dont even know what to think!! !<  . Well, I have. So what I think is that, in the shown-to-player period of time, >!the dreamer!< is completely  losing his mind, and quite progressively.
My PC, PS5 and TV, basil thee actual seasoning, and my cat.
Phone, Puppy, A Drawing Board nyehehe and Basil
my cat, my art ipad \[with a whole bunch of ebooks\], a basil plush, my switch, LED lights, and a freakishly big bean bag with fuzz on it.
absolutely agree on what you said except i'm confused on the last point. . . i assume that's about people arguing >!basil was trying to commit a murder-suicide!< but i don't really see how that observation is unfounded. . . if you disagree with that description then you'd also be arguing that >!basil was never trying to kill himself either, since his actual intent was still just to "get rid of something" in both scenarios to which i'd say i personally just see both as a misunderstood way of achieving the same goal.!<
 . . l feel the necessity to  shut down any "Murder suicide" ideas people come up with. Basil wasn't trying to kill Sunny, he was on the brink of doing himself in.. . Sunny doesn't make any amount of strenuous effort to confront the truth until  only after Basil forces it out of him (Which promptly lead to him severely beating Basil until he let go and stabbed him).. . &#x200B;. . If you read the  battle text, whenever you make a move it says ( \\\\\ attacked Basil),  but when Basil attacks you all it says is (Basil reaches inside of you).. . It also doesn't have a physical attack sprite, but rather the fear attack  sprite  (All in Sunny's head just like the phobia cinematic battles). . Even if you don't attack the "stressed out" meter fills up every time Basil uses his "reach" attack, cries or simply speaks. Sunny is taking continuous "stress" damage, which is the climax of the fight.. . Whether  or not people believe the somethings are supernatural, we see them pull  Sunny close to Basil after the former tries to run away again like a coward. This can either be interpreted as Basil pulling Sunny in close  (The consensus) or a stand/persona battle. Either way, it was outside of Sunny's volition.. . Meaning he truly intended on leaving Basil again, even before Basil closed in on him.. . &#x200B;. . In terms of game-play mechanics, these bosses (Like the phobia and final fights) are cinematic and have a linear outcome.. . They mean to be interpreted rather than taken at face value. . . Whoever says that Basil has his garden shears in hand indicating that he will kill Sunny doesn't make sense.. . Basil  was gonna use those on himself that very night, and they are also used  only once throughout the entire boss fight complete with their own unique animation once Basil is on the brink of collapsing. (Curiously without battle text it doesn't say attack or something unique it just happens.). . Furthermore, we know that Sunny has selective hearing when it comes to confronting the Basil and the truth by proxy.. . So when we go to read in between Basil's lines and hear "I will protect you" That could very well be Sunny hearing whatever he wants, since we know that Sunny is trying  to block out the truth when Basil speaks to him mid fight.. . This is evident by the first bathroom scene, talking to Basil  before trying to run away will prompt him to switch between a terrified expression and a relieved expression one after the other each time you interact with him. The dialogue changes too, this can be repeated many times and it doesn't make any sense if we take it at face value.. . Sunny hears what he wants to hear, we already know he sees things. So how unlikely would it really be if he heard different things  too.. . &#x200B;. . Sorry for taking up too much of your time, but the main points I want to share are these:. . Sunny's ignorance was so strong that he was physically pained by being reminded and embraced by Basil that he began to "Defend himself" and Sunny  wouldn't stop beating Basil until he let go. Basil, battered and bruised by Sunny's physical attacks. Uses his shears in an attempt to retaliate once he knows that Sunny will not stop hurting him and accidentally slashes his eye.. . In the secret ending we can see that.. . Sunny only sustained one severe injury while Basil had several contusions, a black eye and a concussion. Ie; Multiple hits taken.. . Basil was delusional, yes. But was he really that mentally limited?. . If this was supposed to be a murder-suicide we wouldn't see any of the animation sets used in the phobia battles, we'd see the real world set. Which is exclusive to only Sunny's attacks and Basil's final attack.. . TL;DR. . Basil was the one defending himself, after Sunny reacted violently to his embrace and damn near killed him in a bid to run away from the truth again. It most definitely can be interpreted as Basil trying to be rid of Sunny's something, I do not disagree.. . However based on certain elements used in the battle, I believe that it is even more likely that the fight went the way in a more poignant way, and is the ultimate climax of the whole unreliable narrator style narrative, that OMOcat uses the entire game.... . Just before the truth comes to light.
Mostly is Basil physical abuse
basil is a femboy, change my mind
🍉🍉🍉basil🍉🍉🍉
"Bouquet" because each of their personality canonically fits with a flower that Basil mentions.
their debut album is called "hanging around"
And the 2nd one is called "trippin"
"Falling for you"
The 4th album would be "Into deep lake waters"
Stay around me like a noose would be the 5th
The 6th would be "Sleepover nights"
Hahah! Amazing
*Obligatory Weezer reference*
I love this
Thank you
Damn here I am thinking of stupid answers for a cheap laugh.. . This is a terrific answer
Hey don't put yourself down, funni is always better. I wanna see what you came up with.
Best answer I've seen so far
And on Real Life would be "Rotten Bouquet"
Yeah, you win

>!Basil becoming a smashed pumpkin!< was pretty shocking for me.. . The entire >!Truth sequence!< wasn't scary for me, but it was really sickening to experience as a player. I knew it was going to happen to some extent, but I'm really impressed with how much tension the player was able to feel in that part of the game.
Gonna be honest when basil exploded I was in a discord vc and we all burst out laughing. I found all of the basil deaths equally ridiculous. What got to Me though, was the punishment room, especially when I realized I could've saved Mewo.
Yeah I think in certain contexts the basil deaths are hilarious. Except the spider one. Screw. That.
[spoider ]()
NONONONO
Honestly being in a VC makes so much horror and tension *absolutely hilarious*. Basil exploding is so out of left field too lol
the >!(gradually louder) slamming of the piano for every picture during the truth sequence really bothers me for some reason. Even though it is a commonly used cliche in horror films and stuff but man !<

When the gang left Basil in his room to rest. I genuinely started screaming and crying.
Elevator room in black space. I mean yeah it’s cool to see basil die, but even he doesn’t deserve that
the house before the arachnophobia fight, >!the black space town area (i felt unnerved even without knowing about the jumpscare), the red maze, and that black space 2 area with the 1 day left title screen noise loop!<.. . also the neutral ending, it's more heartbreaking than scary but i felt like it should be mentioned. . edit: honorable mentions to >!the black forest area with the omori faces that look like the cat from flapjack (the piñata guy is cool though), the black space hide and seek mirror, and the time when basil got eaten alive by spiders!<
>!The room in Black Space when Basil's head suddenly gets smashed like a watermelon and just straight up kills him. That was easily one of the most unsettling moments in any of the Black Space rooms.!<

I'm not sure.. But I personally think that Basil is probably French or British  So I'll take a guess with the surnames Desrosiers or Bell

I told my boyfriend about my depression and my urge to find a new, fun game. He told me to play this game called "Omori", promising a new fun little wholesome rpg. I got attached to the characters very quickly, especially Basil. >!Let's just say, he and I had a very, very long talk after about 10 minutes of gameplay.!<
W boyfriend
That is so tragic but so funny at the same time…I am so sorry for you
Did it help?
It became a hyperfixation of mine, which means something to live for so yeah it did help
I'm glad to hear it. . . Did it also help you discover some things about your depression/yourself? . . Personally, I was going through some things when I played the game, and finding out the truth genuinely broke me. After some time, I managed to break down my reaction and why It'd hurt as much as it did, and it helped me understand myself better. . . I'm just wondering if something similar happened to you, since you are probably able to relate to some things better.
whut, that's kinda fucked up of your bf to do
Searched for basil as in the plant and came across the character
I was looking at pictures of cute skrunklys on the internet and Basil was in the recommended section, so i did some looking a got Omori on steam. Best experience 
i was literally just looking around on the steam store during the christmas it released and bought it because i liked the rpg part. had no clue it was a horror game until the basil scene lol
I saw an edit of basil and I looked at the tags and it said omori which was familiar because I liked the game before but I forgot about it so I watched a gameplay of it and all the endings 
my friend told me to play it cause he thought i would like it (also he shared a lot of Basil fan art)
I found a tf2 mod that replaced the spy disguise kit with a picture of bagel
I found out through fanart of Basil who looked/looks like the love child or fusion of two of my human designs of characters from The Amazing World Of Gumball & I became obsessed with him before I even know the name of the game bc those two characters are two of my favourites 😭😭 HAHAHJSJD
Sidetails, I used to have his haircut a while back and it’s called “tomboyish sidetails”
>Sidetails. . Why is the correct answer this far down?. . okay I get it, it's the top comment now, no need to reply
seriously though
Maybe it’s quite a niche haircut? Never really seen it outside of media and often isn’t given a name.. . I can’t even find any male versions of it online except only when the sidetails reach ear-length at maximum (not a sideburn either because it is hair extending down instead of growing directly there)
Yeah it’s not common for guys to have it, I got made fun of for having it lol
This was the top comment for me lol
good to see it's finally where it deserves to be
i'm not sure if you know this or not based on your comment but this is actually the top comment now
oh thank you
Well, now it’s the top comment.
Not anymore, it’s the top answer now
I think you're the only person that's mentioned sidetails
Link has them too
Yess <3
nice thank you :>
>tomboyish. . Basil is a girl confirmed
I sure their called leaves
Wait, his?
Idk if you played the game but yeah, Basil is a boy, they always refer to him by he/him too, all game long.
welcome to gay, I hope you enjoy your stay

Basil expert right here
I remember the name "Sigma8K" better than i remember my own
for a moment i thought it was “sigmabk“ for some reason
I've seen people call them tufts of hair, really can be named anything tho honestly
They’re John from now on then
They're parasitic worms feeding on Basil's brain matter and controlling his mind.
It wasn’t Basil’s fault is was THE WORMS!!
The piece you highlighted is Basil’s bangs.. . The  flower thing on his head is called garland.
the highlighted part is called a sidetail  and the flower thing is a flower crown 
The bangs of any other height or shape are no longer side tails. The garland made out of anything else and worn for non celebratory purposes is neither flower, nor crown.
the "garland" literally has flowers in it and its called a flower crown (probably) because it sits on the crown of your head
There is a tree over there. . . Me: It’s evergreen.. . You: It’s pine.
dude, are we thinking of different things when thinking of the word garland? i think of the stuff you wrap around christmas trees. also some of the things youre saying are making very little sense
Whenever you tie things like flowers in to a chain, you get a garland. . . When you tie two ends of garland to make a rim, you get a wreath. . . Wreath is made out of garland. If you take a wreath and put it on your head, it becomes a crown.. . There a wreaths that are based on a ring, that is essentially impaled with various branches and decorations and therefore is not made out of garland. . . However, some people will say “your wearing a garland” and they aren’t incorrect, since that garland could have been tied around your body in various ways. . . When you wear a wreath on your head, it’s not necessarily a crown. Depending on the use and the attached meaning, it may have a different name.. . Regardless. Like I said. This is being picky on details. People can say garland, wreath or crown and they will still be right. . . Your picking on my comment to correct me, while in reality your not correcting me, your just pointing out that I used general term instead of specific one.
Hair like the other person said,. . but if you want to be specific it could either be bangs, or sideburns!
Pretty sure it's sidetails since the hair extends from the top instead of growing directly on the side like a beard
yeah sideburns are a type of facial hair named after ambrose burnside for Obvious Reasons If You've Seen The Man
Wow I learn something new every day
sidebangs?

I don’t think you guys know what sideburns are 
Sideburns grow from the side of your face, the two pieces of basil’s hair hang down
Bangels
Bangs? Idk. . Vines?. . Basil?. . Brain worm?
i think theyre specifically called tendrils, like the plant, but its also what its called when you pull out the side hairs of your ponytail to frame your face
His weed stashes
Forelocks!

I actually used to have his hair cut, but my little front sides of hair where much longer. I still don’t know the name of the hair cut, since I cut it myself.

Those are called a bad haircut.. . Don't quote me, but yes I'm pretty sure they're bangs instead of sideburns.. . But seriously though Basil needs a haircut so bad he literally has a triangle on his head

Basil plays PVZ . . 0 doubt.
I thought about that too
He also plays pvz garden warfare but only the plant side
Yes but only for the zen garden
basil would play garden simulator. and that is a real game.. . 
I if im serious i dont think he would because he probably only likes real plants ig
i guess you’re right
I think i got it, do you know the game/app where you plant trees n stuff when you sre not using your phone? Like you set a target for 6 hours and get a tree. Im sure basil would play that because he doesnt use his phone often and its plants lol
stardew valley…
Basil farming simulator 2025
PIKMIN IS SUCH A GOOD ANSWER FOR BASIL
I feel like Basil would like animal crossing, (he would be awfully kind to the villagers too)
Basil would play DOOM
basil would be a nintendo guy, probably a big fan of zelda and kirby
Basil is a huge pvz fan
Basil has like hundreds of hours in Animal Crossing. Has every version of the game
Basil definitely plays stardew valley
Basil plays Balatro. He wishes he could use a flush five on his friends when they play cards.
Basil would love animal crossing
Basil would probably play pumpkin panic, the perfect mix between horror and gardening
Basil would definatly play animal crossing
I feel like Basil would play farming simulator
Basil would be a fan of lawnmower simulator
Basil would 100% play power wash simulator.
Basil would DEFINITELY play stardew valley
I think Basil would play Stardew Valley
Omori and Basil would play Animal Crossing for sure.
Basil plays stardew valley, he told about it.
Basil would definitely play star dew valley no doubt
Basil probably plays Stardew Valley
>!Why do I think Basil would play *Pikmin*? While assuming it's a fun and cute planting game, only to be scarred for life?!<
Well if one can't see it, better. But the pose and the look are kinda alluring imo. And the high socks, c'mon, there was no need to add those, since Omori canonically doesn't wear them, but wears the shorter ones. The high knee socks are widely perceived as "sexy" and there's no need to put them on a child. Maybe I'm just exaggerating, but imo something's slightly off. Also think about that Basil close up
I think it's implied that Basil was suffering from some sort of dissociation/ hallucination again, leading to a mental breakdown (similar to the way he sees "something" behind Sunny).
I never noticed such implications. Can you explain to me?
I only say it's implied because we've seen Basil have a nervous breakdown in front of Sunny before as he's actively hallucinating. And he's acting very erratic/ panicked here as well. We don't know anything for sure obviously, but my only guess as to why Basil is acting so erratically here, similar to how he was sometimes with Sunny, is that he's undergoing some kind of psychosis or mental break.
Totally understand, it's definitely ambiguous and left to interpretation!
the curse of the 4th comment 
Problem?
THE CURSE OF THE 4TH COMMENT!1!1!1. . you dont understandt5\31hpy:2468. . also no i dont have a problem, its a joke?
It's just that clearly everyone hated to hear my opinion (what's the point of asking then?)
no its this thing on reddit, i saw it on another post a while back, it called the curse of the 4th comment, where the 4th comment got randomly downvoted for no reason, even if they said the same things as other people who got upvoted.. . heres a link of one i found: . . heres another wih the 5th comment as well: 
Look at my other comment (talking the same thing)
yh ok fair enough. tbh id advise to just ignore them, its just reddit being reddit. i get that its annoying, but luckily its internet points and not real money
Indeed. Hence why the ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|trollface) in my comments.
My man here got 85k+ karma I don't think he cares about some downvotes
I think it's because your response seemed dismissive of the discussion, and of the situation Basil was in. Nothing to do with being the 4th post. . . It strikes me as weird that your thought is to simply say he wanted the attention, when Basil's entire character would suggest he wanted anything but that
Indeed I miscommunicated. But I didn't change because it was too late + I'm not a karma hunter.
Idk man with the amount of trauma he went through it feels kinda insulting to say him having a panic attack (possibly due to seeing the people who terrorised him so much) is only for attention.
Yes I know. I miscommunicated.. . But now I think it's too late.
might wanna edit or delete the comment, I definitely took offense to it as someone who suffers similar anxiety to basil. saying "problem, r/OMORI?" with a troll face is NOT helping your case
I know. It's just because they're hating the others opinion instead of saying why they don't like.. . So I said "problem?"
I think there are a couple moments that hint that Basil is having a hallucinatory breakdown! (Spoilers:). . 1) there's a point in the game where black space Basil says something akin to "while you tucked your soul safely away in whitespace, mine was torn in two". I think this implies that Sunny is in a full fugue state and Basil is in a half fugue state.. . 2) when hanging out with real world Basil, he gets anxious and goes to the bathroom. If you follow him, he'll be looking in the mirror and you'll see SOMETHING. Basil says "you see it too, Sunny?" Then begs you not to leave him alone with it.  . . 3) OP's scene where Basil is flipping his absolute shit lol. I think it's implied he's seeing something more than what's actually happening. . . 4) when you confront Basil at the sleepover, he says something like "but you didn't push Mari, right? I saw...Something...behind you. That's what killed Mari, I'm sure of it. But I knew people wouldn't understand..." . . 5) also at the party, when Basil is attacking you, he seems to think he's attacking SOMETHING instead. . . 6) in the Best ending, an additional scene shows Basil and Sunny smiling at each other while Something disappears. Implying both have left their fugue states. . . Tl;dr my theory is that while Sunny's trauma pushed him into fantastical dreams, Basil's trauma pushed him into waking nightmares. Basil's brain couldn't handle Sunny's uncharacteristic violence and hallucinated SOMETHING to replace the memory. But then his brain couldn't un-hallucinate it. He saw it everywhere. It's a manifestation of his trauma.
This theory actually sets Basil in the AFRAID section of the emotion chart, and coincides 500% with the whole game
Hey, here's a fun fact, Sunny's SOMETHING disappears completely during the Good Ending, while it looks like Basil's just retreats into him. It makes sense, since Sunny had to go through an entire 4 year journey to forgive himself, and Basil was just a nervous wreck during those four years, being bullied by Aubrey and the Hooligans. OMORI 2: The Reckoning of Basil when?
Ooooh I hadn't noticed that. Great fun fact I cant wait for Basil 2 Electric Boogaloo
Regarding the first point, I think that refers to Sunny’s ties to Basil.. . Everyone in Headspace are people who are either:. - real, but don’t know the secret (Hero/Kel/Aubrey). - >!dead (Mari)!<. - completely made up (pretty much everyone else). Then there’s Basil.. . Basil is in a weird place since he knows what Sunny did. Since it’s implied the events of the Hiki ending happen again and again, Basil always finds something out and Sunny represses Basil down into black space. The result is Basil having half of him shoved deep away, while a very shallow imitation of Basil lives in Headspace, and the “Something?” Basil is the one who knows the truth and has been exiled countlessly for it.
It’s fine Basil.
about your first example, i think basil had said "The day you became nothing... my soul was ripped in two. Which do you think was more painful?"
Almost certainly a psychosis episode of some sort. He most likely just wants his friends back too, and so screams hoping they come to his rescue somehow.. . He was also probably >!About to kill himself!< too so he may have just become aware of that fact and is now wanting help from someone he trusts to help him out of this.. . Also all his bullies are around him. . Poor Basil 
He’s just a bit silly 
little silli
Damn...
Damn that fact was definitely a fun one! 
Yea, was thinking the same.
I think he was just scared that they were going to do something. But the other explanations people have been coming up with are a lot cooler than that
>!oh basil's body would be a lot cooler alright!<
Tf? If you mean dead than that is not what I meant at all, nor did I mention that
Oh. Nevermind then.
All good
I mean, they've already bullied him before and now they're surrounding him, why wouldn't he scream? Possibly he wanted to drown himself in that lake, but he was caught and now he's panicking.
The guy is a nervous, guilty wreck facing down people who only yesterday physically assaulted him, surrounding and outnumbering him, with his back to a pond when he can't swim. You're surprised he overreacted and panicked?
He found out who Joe is......
The objectively correct answer
Who is Joe?

i thought of Joe Tazuna from YTTD
He's just like me fr
Maybe he panicked idk or he just overreacted 
He totally overreacted
He’s panicking
Poor boy. He was probably paniking.
They're straight up confused as to why basil is doing this. So yeah i'd say he has good reason to believe them
They're shitty kids, he's in the right to think that they would've been lying
And yet they scream and berate hik for making a scene instead of helping him? They also a territorial with the lake area, as if they own this place, which they legally don't.
What the fuck are they supposed to do? give basil some physical contact which would make the situation worse?. . And they don't scream, and I guess you *could* see their comments as demeaning
Does basil really look like he's down to talk?. . What do you have that confirms that they screamed? All we know is was going to be asked to get off of the premisis but he broke down before they got a chance to.. . Basils friends also told them to leave somewhere that didn't belong to Basil or his friends in that exact scene... And they both resorted to force. Besides none of them own any part of the park or any place for that matter.. . Wouldn't this make all the main HW characters terrible? All of them have gotten into fights for one reason or another, specifically for selfish reasons like "I want to know where this character is"
No, they could have calmed him down with a far better tone rather than being aggressive. . . Kel only told them to let Basil be and not to go away, they did that on their own, he did not tell them to get lost, they did that. . . No, because no one other than the Hooligans do that and unless you think you own a place because you regularly visit it, you cannot expect people to accept your call. Kel and Sunny got into fights due to them not willingly to tell where Aubrey (a confirmed theif) is and fought in self defense. Hardly their fault. . . Basil doesn't deserve to be bossed around, much less from the Hooligans, especially with what they did with the young adult the day before.
And Basil should have been perfect too, so should almost everyone else. How skilled do you think they are at calming people down exactly? The chances of them  have the skill to calm basil down are at about the chances of Basil choosing to stand up to them.. . "Let basil be" means "Get away from basil" and as such "Get away from this area where basil is" The hooligans also asked for Basil to go somewhere else, Kel is just better at phrasing it.. . Okay, then lets take The Maverick, Kel deadnames him and provokes him into a fight. you also have to notice how in none of the fights is running allowed, so they've decides at that point to fight until one side can't fight anymore. **Also** Aubrey at that time is not a confirmed theif but thought to be one by Kel and presumably sunny, since basil never says that Aubrey stole the book. Sunny also took it without basils consent at an earlier date.. . The Hooligans were not actively bullying basil in this scene, it's made very obvious actually... They're all 5 tiles away from his sprite.
because he was having a panic attack
I assumed that he's freaking out just because they are there at all. They've been bullying him. They don't do anything and he's screaming, but basil is so sensitive at this time. He's tired. They might've not hurt him physically but it's annoying as hell that they think they can tell him to leave like that.
My man is clearly mentally unstable
I mean he has been bullied by these kids for almost 4 years now, and the day before we saw Kim hit him during the confrontation at the park. I would argue a better question would be why shouldn’t he scream?. . I mean if you were alone and surrounded by 6 people who have been physically and verbally harassing you for the past 4 years would you really act any different?
I mean I’d panic if I saw my former friend’s face full of malice, with a spiked bat, and a bunch of aggressive friends, also don’t forget one of her friends hit him with a bike when you first see him
Psychotic break. I felt the pain in this scene really hard. When you've been bullied by the same people over and over your body will recognize this and go into fight or flight. He was definitely having a panic attack, at the least.
Someone took his tofu ):
either he's hallucinating, or he doesn't believe them
He just got too silly.
A little goofy even
Perhaps a tad quirky
Given how much they bullied him I really don’t think he was going to believe them when they said they wouldn’t do anything. It’s not like they proved themselves to be that trustworthy
They’re going to sacrifice Babil oh no

Panic attack
Basil was so protective for the spot that he called Sunny
I read this comment completely wrong. I thought you meant Basil called the hangout spot "Sunny" for a second. I need sleep
He was yiiking out
he didn't like them
He is absolutely hallucinating in this scene.
Basil is very prone to panic attacks/psychotic episodes, so the pressure of the Hooligans being a trigger for that isn’t really surprising.
Spoiler tag
Sorry
After reading all of these replies I feel like I dumbass for thinking he was doing it for attention 😶😶😶😶
He's not the sanest boy by this part of the story.
:"It's time for our vibe check , Basil"  . 
because he’s surrounded by his bullies
Probably an episode of LBS which he is pretty directly hinted at having
He just found he's gonna be part of a Killing Game.. . (No joke though, I'm writing a joke Danganronpa fanfic and Basil is the protagonist.)
Two options:. . . 1: He's panicking because he's been victimized by the hooligans before, and oftentimes when victims of physical or mental violence are faced with their abusers, they may freak out, and no matter how much reassurance they receive, they still believe that something bad might happen to them, and want to stay as far away from their abusers and anyone too similar to them (which is why a lot of bully victims tend to be cautious or down right hostile towards people whom are much like their bullies, or their bullies themselves, it's because it's the only way their brain knows to keep them safe, is to make the perceived abusers stay as far as possible from them. Basil seems to be doing the same, screaming to make his abusers stay as far away from him). . . 2: He's having hallucinations of something that might/is actually attacking him. It's obvious throughout the playthrough of the game that since the incident, Basil is suffering from hallucinations, which might be the case here.
He was bullied.
because he’s a bitc- but seriously probably just trauma and grief
They might've started to threaten him with violence to force him to leave, so he got scared
It's a mental breakdown. . *kazoo noises*
He was just hanging out in their old place until they came in so Basil got scared
cuz he’s a little bitch boy and i hate him 🖕
Isn't pressuing people to leave public space and doing this aggressive the same as throwing them out? . . They did something bad to Basil, but why he screamed? Could be trauma of seeing them again or his delusions. Whatever it does not justify the Hooligans attempting to throw him out .
Because he’s a little pissbaby/j (IM JOKING IM JOKING DONT COME AFTER ME)

Indeed.
Basil has a victim complex, combine that with very little emotional strength and you get this
lol, he doesn’t have a victim complex. he just IS a victim
He likes to be saved from danger a little... *too* much... I mean the people im this scene just showed up and basil is immediately on the floor yelling for help
Imaging saying an actual victim has a victim complex
attention seeking or hes just scared idk

>!Something Stand Battle!<. . . The final battle of >!Stone Ocean!< be like:
I don't think anyone here hates or extremely dislikes a ship, we all have a mutual taste towards one ship or another.. . For example, Basil defenders would most likely love the Sunflower (I think it's called) ship because they are attached and appreciate what Basil is as a person.. . And for the Heromari ship, it's just cause it was somewhat classified as canon so the ship is universally loved.. . We got our own tastes so no 2 ships are invalid.
>I don't think anyone here hates or extremely dislikes a ship. . suncest 
🤚i do
Define “Suncest”
Listen. . Shipping is ok, i don't care about what people like . . If you like something it's ok, enjoy the stuff you do if it makes you happy . . But don't annoy people with these stuff. . It's like the Basil hate posts or defending basil posts . . I don't care about basil, it was funny when it started now it's not. . Stop making this stuff
Oh yeah that stuff is annoying. Some of it is ironic however some of it is not.
I prefer Sunburn over Sunflower and the other ships, not because I'm a homophobe or something. I just think that Sunny's and Basil's relationship is really toxic and being in a romantic relationship might psychologically damage both of them, or at least Basil. Also, I see Kel and Sunny and Kel and Basil only as friends. Sunburn just feels the most natural among most of them. . . But you will have to know: The larger a fandom grows, the more fights there are over ships. It happens in each fandom.

Basil haters looking at this and then to their blenders:
Basil
Where is the link for this etsy. I must have bagel!!!!!
I would personally get the omori or basil ones, because I really like the colors that they both have :)
Basil
I bought one of those!!!! I got basil
Auby, I wouldn't hate her as a person if I got to understand her upbringing. But it feels cruel to me that she bullied Basil for years by not understanding that Basil is not the one who blacked out the photos.. Aubrey is the one taking it too far by bullying Basil when he is only being civil to her. Plus, I know myself  that I wouldn't be comfortable around a girly like her and only be walking on eggshells.
Basil
I don’t think I’d hate any of the characters irl that I wouldn’t hate in-game. I’d be more critical of Basil though.
The bagel is disturbed
basil - he is like my poor little meow meow in-game, but in real life i would get SO tired of him SO quickly. i have a terrible habit of trying to therapize my friends and i would try so hard on basil that it'd become a chore just to interact with him. at his current mental state, he'd be so exhausting.
Basil
Yeah, basil is a beta cuck male who is hella codependent
basil tbh. like his personality in game is rlly relatable n stuff but if i actually knew him irl that would get old very fast
All top comments are pretty spot-on for me.   . Mikael - probably would think he's a weirdo and try to avoid  . Sweetheart - really hate this type of people irl, might've tried to troll her on the internet.   . Aubrey - would just consider her a bully, and probably wouldn't even give her a chance to open up. Although if we're talking pre-incident, she's just a poor sweet girl, nothing to hate about her really.  . Weirdly enough - Basil. I think if a person would poke my eye out with sheers, I'd be terrified of them for life. Although pre-incident Basil might just be the only person I'd need in my life to be happy forever.   . Kinda surprised no one is talking about Kim, her smarty attitude usually doesn't look well in real life. She's like a Karen, but from the 90s.   . Oh, and yeah, Basil's parents.
Honestly Basil. I love Basil so much, he’s my precious plant child, but he’s so goddamn helpless and it makes me wanna pull an auby.. . I will not be elaborating as to what that means because I don’t know how to spoiler stuff on Reddit.

Basil definitely. I cannot deal with overly emotional people, although I love him to bits :))
basil is pure, refined evil poured haphazardly into a bag of flesh, if i encountered basil, I would  immediatly drop whatever i was doing and do everything in my power to destroy him
... This indicates that you (platonically) love him while he's a character.
Somehow everything you just said was wrong.. Basil is a guy, and he didn’t take pictures irl (note how one of the pictures is literally of Basil holding the body with Sunny, with both of his hands full) that was something that only happens in black space to remind Sunny of the truth. And there was no saving Mari, she was dead from the fall, and Basil wasn’t there at the time.
Basil tbh
basil, he sounds like he WOULD BAG abt ROCKS and how COOL and BADASS he is.
Basil, I wouldn't hate him but I don't think I'd like him as a friend or anything.
Probably Basil, I love his personality and character design but as a person be seems a bit clingy and obsessive
I love basil but damn that kid is scary.
BASIL. (biggest basil kinnie here)
Basil for sure but i dont even love him as a character
Basil definietly

Basil for sure. Im okay with his character, but in real life he'd be that weird ass kid i would just dog on tbh.

basil, i think he’d just be that one weird kid you have in your class.

Says that the only violent thing is stabbing your friend but spoilers you also stab yourself multiple times and stab a cat and Basil dies alot in black space and probably some other things.
Considering what the Nendoroid Basil cost, it's not so bad.

I did, too. But OMORI takes place in the 90's. While I didn't grow up in the 90's, I've seen phones from back then, they certainly didn't look like that. XD. . So I looked a little closer in this image, and it definitely resembles a GameBoy.
: Hang on, Basil. I'm about to beat Red.
Half a Basil
1 million basils (expendable)
>!This picture is of headspace and we can assume that because of that it’s not taken with a camera but with basils own eyes like how in the truth pictures the prospective is not through a camera but basils eyes!<
Woah
That is a 5head answer
>!Lmao it was at that moment that I was talking to my friend in confusion about Basil taking pictures, and it dawned on me that these are memories. He explained how yeah, they all were.!<. . >!That reveal though too was great!<
imagine if it was just an art bug 
Basically [this video]() lmao
exactly what i thought
ahh! i was wondering how they were taken...like did he bring his camera?? lmao
the horrors of headspace allowed one of his eyes to temporarily become a camera
wow, smart thinking!
Basil just held out his arm really far so that the burger got into frame 🤯
I mean, you can also shoot an instant camera with one hand, it's not a shotgun, but that explanation sounds way better

i had to draw this. . . . i think he taped the camera into his face

Skibidi camera head guy. . (Please kill me)

Hilarious.
It's a random obscure fact on omori canon that basil actually has 2 hands
source?
[. . . . Please correct me if the math is wrong
can't believe i never noticed this.
damn, r/theydidthemath
Your right . .  7•10²⁷ atoms*
i feel like Basil is the type of kid to hold a burger with two handz
Holy shit
It’s almost as if he has more than one hand
He probably just used his WREATH skill to pick up the camera and take a photo.
. . Well…
First thing I thought lol
He's just using his left hand lmao
But the button to take the photo is usually on the right side, so his left hand must look crazy as he takes this
I don't get it. He's using one hand to hold burger and one hand to hold camera.
No the full picture is him using both hands stupid
Then maybe use the full picture next time stupid
i literally checked the full picture he only used his right hand in the photo idk what’s so impossible about this
Maybe don't post a cropped picture then??? 
Use the whole photo. Then there would be no confusion.

THANK YOU! Been trying to edit my comment for a while but Reddit sucks.
I just checked the photo album from the wiki and he isn't.
it literally isn’t but go off
Why are you so rude💀

Lol who’s the stupid one now
Yeah, that was obvious.
Google left hand
Holy lefty
New appendage just dropped
yeah how?? It’s not like he has two hands or anything!!!
The full picture has him using both hands Dont think that your smart typing this blud
then why didn't you post the full picture so your question comes across better?
i just checked the wiki and it literally doesn’t have both of his hands in it. picture is still poorly cropped though.
Oh really? I don’t remember it being like that
maybe if you googled it before being instantly hostile to anyone who gave you an answer this could’ve all been avoided.
Ooh gee OP, how smart of you! Unlike me.. I never could’ve spotted the apparent second hand on the borger 
. . With Geedis anything is possible
i miss 15 seconds ago when i hadn’t seen this yet
ismt he holding it with one hand?

Hikkikomori route exclusive
Is that the "other" ending? I just completed my first playthrough the other day
He has a Go Pro xD
He has 2 hands
He has two hands lol
[relevant]()
His third eye
using his teeth ofc 🙄🙄
Telekinesis obviously
He's using his psychic abilities to lift it up
He used the two hair thingies he has on the sides of his head to take the pic 
His stand
Uhm can you not take a photo with one hand?
bro used one hand to eat hamburbur and the other to take a picture.
He’s legally skilled

he could have just held the camera with one hand. If not that its becouse headspace can be anything and its instead POV of basil
Held it with his hand and pushed the screen button with his nose
Omori mfs when people have more than one hand: 
Have people considered the fact his holding the camera in one hand and the burger in another hand
One handed?
I think this is how it works.... . 
Other hand
Stuff in mouth used for chewing
I'm more concerned about that tiny bite in his hamburger
He has a tiny mouth. . 
I need this image in higher res. It looks really good 
Something pushed the button
brazil holding boiga
Look, ma, no hands!
With a camera
is he stupid?
r/batmanarkham
GoPro or something.
I thought he just grew an extra arm or he's using someone else's.
there are some kinda odd things with basils camera generally.. . assuming its a polaroid and not fictionalized. the camera itself has no model denotation on the front. its a red button model. its almost certainly a 600 ISO cause some of the images are patently impossible on an SX-70, indoors without flash like the image of kel infront of hero and mari, or of sunny blowing out candles, but its swaybacked instead of clamshelled. that implys its a modern now or now+ model from 2020, but it has no integrated front flash and has a manual circular light meter, a feature forgone of modern and 600 cameras. so it could only be an SX-70 just modified for 600 film I suppose? that is a thing but I'd have to say extremely uncommon especially for the 90s-2000s most SX-70s are modded for I type though a stock that did not exist during the games time period. so I suppose a modded SX-70 pronto.. . maybe basils dad was a SX-70 modder or something or you weren't supposed to think this through so much.. . I swear some of the photos in the game had the images on the back of the polaroid with the 3 visible lines for the 3 chemical packets but after looking it over again it seems they're all on the right side.
With his mad skills.
OP finds out Basil has another hand
What if basil has 2 hands?
he mixed up the burger and the camera
He has one hand
HE'S USING ONLY ONE HAND!!! DUH!!!
He’s very talented
Maybe it was his other hand, I’m pretty sure he has two of those
He has photographic memory
I don't know, maybe he used juice to hold the camera and the burger at the same time.
He was holding the burger with his toes
basil has a third arm or something hold it for him  . >!(BUT THAT'S JUST A THEORY!!!111!!1! A GAME THEORY!11!!!1!)!<
Because he's got ketchup mixed with lettuce cheese
hes holding it with one hand lol
Goku took the picture!
He was using the other hand.
Uses telekinesis of course
Bcus Basil went "aaaaaah" and put camera in mouth
Two hands and an iPhone
It’s called a grip
It could be a flower helmet camera you would never know
does he only have one hand??? 
M O U T H.
One hand
Winter kills plant life was my guess
That kind of makes sense, I just have the feeling it’s a bit more extensive then that. Otherwise they would have mentioned it in the same scene.
It doesn’t kill them but put them into a hibernation so bagel won’t be able to see all the pretty plants
the snow disabled plants
Yea makes the most sense
seasonal depression probably hits really hard for a kid who has plants as a primary personality trait
r/thatstrue
This is probably the most useless comment on Reddit.
No, this is’
Not really since you just made them aware of how useless it was so now it has a use as for a joke
My guess is that since it rarely snows in headspace (outside of the Church of Something exterior and Snowglobe Mountain which is Hiki exclusive), it kind of gives HS Basil faint remembrance of the winters he spent with his friends in reality, but since Omori has full control in Hiki route, Basil can’t remember it enough to know why he’s sad about it
Snow = cold = ded plants. . +. . Headspace hiki route = forgotten memories
Firs?!!!
Spruce?!!!
Birch?!!!
Cypress?!!!
Oak?!!!
Maple?!!!
Palm?!!!
Tree?!!!
PLANT!!! 
r/brokethechain

fuck i think i know whats wrong with me now
Bro's getting f\*cked over by life anytime it's possible 
Best comment here
That's why Basil's best friend is SUNNY
Sorry I meant something like a poetry, I'm  not english and I did not find the right word, that's so stupid
Okay nerd
🎙
Trauma from cocaine addiction 
oh no, don't mention cocaine!! basil might get triggered and have to go back to his dealer! i cant believe you did this to him 😔😔😔
Let the poor plant boi rest. He's sleeping.
He hates white people
and he is the whitest boy in the group
He hates himself.
true!
Classic Basil
He recognises his own shortcomings and aims to make up for them
He wants to be like Justin Trudeau when he's older 
>!by killing himself!<
I was gonna comment that lol
Snowgrave (he is noelle’s humansona)
Wrong game 
Snow is a transient thing. You should probably enjoy since it does not last long. 
He just fucking hates that shit
Why did I read this in Cuno DiscoElysium's voice
winter/snow falling is usually a symbol for >!death!< i think
maybe it was winter when >!the stair incident happened!<
From the Polaroids we see in the >!truth sequence!<, it’s pretty clear it’s not snowing. Plus, there were references that confirmed it was around late October(?). I can’t recall where they were from though.
I believe because >! The last photo is on october. I don't remember if that one is the one that has "DON'T FORGET IT'S IN THE TOYBOX" tho !<
One of the last photos in the album is on September 22, and says that the recital will be "next month." Could've been any time in October.
cause it's course, rough and cold. And it gets everywhere.
atleast basil is a master, >!at panick attacks.!<
Because of his fallen comrades, back then in the in the Cold war. May the soldiers rest in peace basil will always love them always....
The winter holidays are often sad when your family is as absent/dysfunctional as Basil's.
Where is this dialogue from?
It’s from the first picnic on >!Snowglobe mountain!<.
Because it looks like cocaine but it doesnt taste the same 
He read chainsaw man
Oh no...
Maybe because Christmas and his parents aren’t around?
He watch his brothers fall because he is a fucking snowflake
No plants
He is plant
he's just a loser (kinda valid tho, snow sucks)
He knows what happened when there was Snow on Mt. Silver
Cuz it's cold, like **you know who!** . . &#x200B;. . \[Banned\]
It signifies the end of a year and the beginning of a new— much like their memories; the good times may be over, but more is to come.. . Idk I just felt like an English teacher after finishing a chapter of an AU.
It reminds him that his parents went to go get the milk 
because he ate yellow snow as a kid and has trauma
Because.. . . **h**
His best memories are from a certain summer, and winter is thought to be the polar opposite of it.
- snow is bad for plants. . - winter and snow generally make people feel more sad, and Basil was already in a somewhat concerning state even before joining the friend group. . - considering that this is Sunny's headspace, it might remind him of the violin. . - might be related to the snow around the Church of Something, which appears to be surrounded by snow
He read chainsaw man
I feel like it could be for various reasons... I'll list them . . * The obvious contributor: plant killing season (I know they sometimes just go dormant, but even I get a little sad to see the grass turn yellow-brown and less pretty flowers). * Seasonal depression. Not everyone deals with it, but it commonly occurs during the winter, when the sun is shining less and its cold, bleak and blue outside. Making people feel sad at the changed of the weather and lack of sun.. * Cold! Signs of cols! I feel like basil prefers the spring and summer not just for the plants but for the warmth too. And depending on where the RW versions of them live, I'm gonna guess a lot of others like the summer too or summer is better than winter there.. * Maybe it could be the possibilities... getting it thrown at you, ice hidden beneath (and then slipping on it), having your snowmen destroyed, the forbidden hidden underneath (dog crap), or just the general inconvenience of waking through it when it's more than 5 inches
I think it's because he misses good memories with friends before everything went to crap.
I like to think snow makes Basil sad because it was snowing when his parents abandoned him, but he's likely too young to remember since he was only a toddler.
the church of something is on a snowy mountain
It’s cold, sharp and gets all over the place
i wonder why he's sad of snow(its obvious🗿)
There's probably no specific reason. Like he said, he doesn't know.
This is where we say goodbye
probably doesn't have an intended meaning
Snow kills most vegetation I guess, good catch though. I didn’t even question this statement
Probably a metaphor. I need a context to be able to come up with something
didnt the concert happen in winter
His parents died in a car accident during a snow storm, hes also in denial about it
because he’s a BITCH!!! i love snow snow gang rise up
BASED! LET ME JOIN!
YOURE SO REAL FOR THIS‼️
thanks tesstickle08. i can always rely on you
The name 
BASED
He..literally says he doesn’t know why.
Tulips are a flowering plant species that are native to the Netherlands. While they are native to areas with mild climates, they can also withstand colder weather than many other plants, including light snow.. . In fact, tulips are commonly known for their resilience in colder climates and their ability to bloom in the early spring. The snow on the ground reflects sunlight and helps protect the tulips from frost, which is a common problem in areas with cold weather.. . However, it's important to note that while tulips can withstand light snow, they may not fare well in heavy snowfalls. When covered with a thick layer of snow, tulips can become weighed down and risk destruction due to the sheer weight of the snow.. . In addition, the cold weather can cause the tulips to enter a state of dormancy, which can stunt their growth and prevent them from blooming. While this is a natural process for tulips, it can also be caused by temperature shocks, which can happen if the weather changes quickly from cold to warm.. . Therefore, while tulips can withstand some snow, they shouldn't be counted on to survive heavy snowfalls or large temperature fluctuations. It's always best to consult a local professional, such as a gardener or horticulturist, for specific information on how to care for tulips in your area, as well as how they may fare in snowy conditions.
Maybe this means...
Because he’s a little cry baby   . “Ooh I’m Basil, butterflies and rainbows make me cry!”
Die.. . (I AM JOKING, OKAY?!? THIS IS A JOKE!!!)
hmm I can’t tell if you’re joking or not 
Hmm, well I really don't care!! 
typical Basil fan girl 
You aren't wrong!
Also what 4 people downvoted your comments wtf😭💀
I’m joking btw I still think you’re cool 😎
Of course you are, I'm the coolest!. . No but seriously, I'm joking too lol.
yeah I know 😆 people were downvoting me so I dunno if I was being too mean or something lol 
You weren't being mean at all-
Because he’s a little bitch 

you started a war with the basil stans
I was prepared 😭
lmaoo
stand strong sister 
Basil was actually a prisoner inside a siberian gulag before he escaped and fled to Faraway
>!Corpse colored.!<
because i threw it at him. really hard.
Maybe its like me disliking rain? It's cold, bitter, makes me tired and deppressed but thats winter in general.
Grass is weak to Ice
I don’t know but your banner is freaking gold
something about it melting and things disappearing/leaving probably
He reads chainsaw man.
What? Did you all forget that "hanging accident" happened in winter? Basil is the closest to the Truth, that's why his emotion towards Mari's death "switched" to the snow, though he doesn't realize why he feel this way
But it didnt? It was sometime in october
because is white like cum 
was it winter when *it* happened?
I'd say seasonal depression
Because he sucks
He said he doesn't know why.
Nobody knows, not even Basil himself ¯\(ツ)/¯
Cope
Fine, I'll show you what happens when I use a spell I don't know. >!*Basil used jump rope grave*!<
Where/when does he say this in-game? It's location could provide important context that could help reveal why.
Basil mentions in during one of the Picnic scenes in >!Snowglobe mountain!<. It should be the very first Picnic you find there.
If basil doesnt know, why would we 
Because Basil doesn’t have the Omni-present, much more general focused perspective as we do 
Think of it like one person has to build a house, even if they don’t know how to, a different person can figure it out if they have the blueprints for it.
He's a whiny lil bitc-
he's gonna have to shovel out the driveway by himself
I always assumed it was because it kills plants. Could be seasonal depression, though.
Omori would be canceled from calling basil homophobic slurs
For real
I see it
I'm pretty Sure Basil will jump to take the blame
With how much people were overreacting to what Basil does at one point in the story, >!he would definitely get cancelled for having hanged an innocent person. And no one would bother trying to know the full picture of his situation.!<
Basil said the N word after stubbing his toe.
Basil: People would try to cancel him for... Y'know what but he would get defended by half of the world because cute lil guy. . Sunny: .... . Aubrey: Almost drowning Basil(Even if it wasn't her intention). . Hero: So much rizz that he can be considered a national threat. . Kel: ... I dunno. . Mari: ... She 💀
I would be cancelled for >! Bullying Basil in the blackspace !<
Basil for filming a dead body
Basil gets canceled for being a downer
Also, literally the first encounter you have with him is  >! him saving you and basil from drowning.!< He isn’t that unfit.
Good thing no spiders in the >!water!<
They looked up basil’s name on google 
No NO NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Basils search history
My secrets!
: Don't ask!, eat this you fucking psycho bitch!.. . &#x200B;. . (Pursuit): Oh shit-. . &#x200B;. . \*Basil shoot all the ammunition against the fake Hero (aka: pursuit)... killed him\*. . &#x200B;. . : Uff uff, nice shot Basil.
(Meanwhile, in Basil's secret weapons lair). . : Why do you have an attack drone?. . : My parents are illegal arms dealers. They send me weapons on holidays. Anyway, you should be safe here. I'll send out the drone to find that guy and kill him.. . Kim and Vance: (visibly terrified)
: Now who wants to see my nuke?. . (And then Basil showed them his nuke. The end)
The perfect ending lol
I see but honestly I don’t know what could they do about Omori like if they make it that basil is gay I would totally not be against it 🫠 if they invented a whole love story about basil and hero I would feel wtf are you doing
basil gets rewritten to be ubermasculine to appeal to a wider global audience
I fucking love this dumb depressed anxious mentally ill bimbo, he's my favourite character. Anyway here's some reasons why people could dislike him. . >!He hung Mari. If you choose to believe that Mari didn't die from the fall but died from the hanging, then Basil becomes the one who actually killed Mari. If you don't believe this, it's still pretty fucked up that his first course of action was to stage a suicide, which then left the friend group broken and full of grief for 4 years. It was irrational and can be argued to be unrealistic for a 12 year old to do. Also some people just generally treat him and Sunny like they're psychopaths for what they did despite the game clearly showing how traumatised and guilt-ridden both of them are.!<. . >!Some people feel that he's underdeveloped, including myself. DW Basil appears in the game's intro, then never again until you reach Blackspace. RW Basil is shown on the first day, is unavailable for half of the second day until you run into him and the Hooligangs at the hideout, and on the third day he tries going through with his suicide plan. So you dont really get a full grasp on his character because you don't get to hang out with him for a long time like you do with Aubrey, Kel and Hero!<. . >!He's mainly just kinda used as a plot device? In Headspace and in the Real World. In Headspace, your goal is to find Basil, and it turns out Omori kills him multiple times over because Basil is a threat to Sunny facing the truth. In the Real World, Basil is regularly used to give hints about the truth behind Mari's death, and the Neutral endings are literally based around Sunny just not bothering to save him.  Some people probably feel that Basil is less of a character and more of a way to progress Sunny's story!<. . >!He's kinda implied to be forgiven for cutting Sunny's eye out in the True Ending. I think some people at that point viewed Basil as a danger and that he should be held responsible for such a serious and fucked up thing, and some may believe that Sunny shouldn't have forgiven him in that lil True Route cutscene where they smile at each other. But then again the True Ending is up for interpretation!<. . And sometimes it just really comes down to  personal preference. Sometimes you just dislike a character without really knowing why
well said, keyboard warrior 🫡 (I agree)
I take pride in my ability to type needlessly long answers 
I want to say i do the same, but that would be too short of an answer so i added this
This just reenforces my yearning for a dlc including Basil as a main character, and not just someone in the background. Maybe something in Headspace idk, I just wanna see more of him and his childhood, to flesh out his relationship with Sunny and explain why he's so mentally ill that >!he chose to stage a suicide and continue like nothing happened !<
[This essay]() explains more about Basil's character in a better way than I ever could, so you could check it out if you're interested. There are a lot of implications about Basil's childhood in the game that get overlooked by some people and this guy does a great job at explaining it all
That's long, still read it, it all makes sense
while this is probably a really good paragraph about basil and mental health in general, It's way too long for my chronically online, constantly sleep deprived brain too read. I'll update you if I'll do read it in the future though
> >!continue like nothing happened!<. . My brother in christ have you even played the game?
while we do see his guilt, this happens 4 YEARS after the incident. 4 YEARS. way too much time if you ask me to be moping around and be depressed
I can see a dlc where you can explore Basil's headspace. You get to see just what goes through his head when he dreams, the guilt he feels.
You need to remove the spaces for spoilers
Im a babil warrior 
All I can say is I agree with everything you said and like you I love him thanks for saying everything we want to say 
To be honest, there's more reasons then this. I do not hate basil, as I think he's pretty neat, but I'm surrounded by a lot of people that don't like him. I could give my reasons but I don't know how to spoiler text on Reddit yet oof
To add spoiler text you just put > ! at the start and ! < at the end without any spaces between the exclamation mark and the arrow! And yeah I know these aren't all the reasons, but they're some of the common ones I've seen floating around
Thank you for helping. Let me just give this a test before I actually start writing the reasons. >!test!<
Okay, it works. So, here's more reasons as to why some people hate basil:. . >!So I noticed, a lot of people complain about his temperament. I've had some people call him a 'bitch boy' infront of me. And I can somewhat understand their point, it's not nice to call anyone that, but he's just really depressive in the real world, even before finding out your moving away. However, spoilers, he is actually really clingy because of his attachment trauma. It is implied in the game that his parents chose their job over basil, and basil just felt like a burden to him. Upon finding out his best friend, sunny, is moving away, he basically loses his mind, which is why he acts the way he does just before the real life battle sequence between sunny and basil.!<. . >!Another reason is it is somewhat implied in the game that he doesn't actually take responsibility for his part (the hanging of mari), and instead completely refuses to believe the truth and instead blames it on "something behind sunny", and not a lot of people are quite fond of this for obvious reasons!<. . >!lastly, the only point I can think of otherwise is his toxic positivity complex. Trying to make himself believe everything will be okay, chanting it as if it's some kind of positive affirmation in which it is not. Some people might get uncomfortable from this.!<
Well done explanation! Me, just like him cuz Basil is a nice name for someone
I wish i didnt look at that first one
I forgot what it was then re-looked and i'm mad pissed
I can’t imagine his hair in 3d space. Trying to draw this disgusting gremlin is the hardest thing ever. That’s why I fucking hate him. . . Now Excuse me while I go draw him some more
I can draw everyone besides him. His hair makes him look like a roach when I try to
try looking at that scene of him turnin around
I always thought it would look like [this guys]() except for the giant ponytail in the back
oml Trainer N.. . I hated his champion fight
Ayo dude happy cake day
Thank you. Have a great day, yourself
Happy cake day 🍰
happy cake day
Thanak you! Have a very good day
thanks
The link isn’t coming up for me, who are you talking about?
N from Pokemon
I from Zelda. . /s
yeah.
I find this fascinating because his hair is pretty easy for me to draw except that goddamn flower. Probably just a art style thing though
basil's hair is a force of nature
I've never drawn him but I've dealt with some pretty unrealistic hair so I bet it's not too bad.
It hurts to admit Basil isn’t perfect, but you’re right.
 >!People like to forget how irrational and emotional actions can be for children when discussing fictional characters.!<
and for neurodiverse people, regardless of age
Also for everyone else, when they are in various states of mind that inhibit sound judgement.
Exactly this. Like how do you even take yourself seriously when saying that a panicked 12 year old that just saw his friend die in front of his eyes would act rationally? 😭
They didn't read this essay: 
I just read the essay and.... . Dude I love Basil now. How the fuck...
New knowledge attained. Putting it on my wall to read every morning from now on.
You, my friend, are ~~evil~~ BLESSED 
I don’t like the Omori fandom’s tendency to deny that Sunny and Basil have any responsibility for their actions.
Well the majority deny that *Sunny* had any responsibilities for his actions. The whole problem is that a lot of people like to act as though Basil ***SHOULD*** have ***100%*** responsibilities for his actions. . . It's quite literally a double standard of ludicrous proportions.
I mean, one's an accident another's a 2nd degree felony so I do see their point. . . Morally? Basil is on the light grey side, he did have good intentions although bad actions. . . Now, legally? Welp, he's probably in for 4 years of juvie or 400-700 hours of community service.
You say that like what Basil did was under any sensible state of mind though.
>!If you look at the annotations of the black space album, Basil was calling the shots. He spoke firmly and authoritatively when telling Sunny to help him in the cover-up. To me, that bespeaks a state of self-control.!<
That essay is about how a lot of people overlook (mainly) Basil's mental state when evaluating and making assumptions about his actions. It seems to argue that there are clearly many signs of his problems throughout the game that are often overlooked by people who don't *truly* know of these issues. It is a response specifically to Basil hate, not an argument as to why he did nothing wrong.. . Edit: wording
> It is a response specifically to Basil hate, not an argument as to why he did nothing wrong.. . It effectively is the latter though, because it essentially argues that Basil's mental state was such that he wasn't responsible for his actions.
Their intent was merely to inform people of stuff they think they may have missed, they even said here that this was their aim. They said here basically, if they’re gonna hate Basil, do it from a place of understanding:. . . . (Comment highlighted in blue not orange)
I already loved him before but this just made it better. The person who wrote it did a great job.
thank you for sharing! this is great
No problem lol but yeah this isn’t mine I just saw it linked a few days ago and remembered it tbh.
Oh hey I've read this before-
This
Everyone doesn't hate Basil, the majority don't but a significant part do and their reasoning is that there isn't enough time to make his real world self likable.
Kinda hard to develop the character of someone thats terrified of the protagonist
Too add on to this I kinda hate how rw story line mostly how it revolved around Aubry I was asking my self if sunny could just speak and said "just give basil his photos backs and I'll get out of your way" also how she's acts like she's just better then basil without reason like "you think I'm the bad guy" JUST TELL ME WHY YOU THINK YOUR BETTER? Also she's pushed basil into the lake and no one cares like I expected for hero or kel to get really mad as ya know your 2 of your best friends almost died and everyone just is fine with it and forgives her 1 day later . and the only time basil becomes a main character is when he's fighting sunny and makes sunny a pirate (fox) but yeah I just wish we got a bit more time in real world so we could flesh out everyone a bit more as we barely got hero and for God sake MAKE HUMPHREY A OMROI EXCLUSIVE PLZ. . . I know I'm gonna get ripped to shreds but the for reading
MAKE HUMPHREY A OMROI EXCLUSIVE PLZ, what do you mean by that?. Also, since basil is lost in the headspace and what Sunny sees in Faraway seems to affect his dreams, Faraway Basil getting screentime would mean the entirety of the headspace Storyline becoming unconvincingly out of touch with reality
Well, headspace isn't perfect. Since Basil seems to attract the truth no matter how many pieces he's split to and Omori is running out of places to not find Basil in, OMORI and Pals are going deeper into headspace (closer to blackspace) and things start to get less perfect. Reverse mermaids, various mazes, direct references to the truth, deeper well, Mr. Jawsum... And since OMORI can't shove Sunny into blackspace without all the Basil's saying anything, I think he tries to make his friends forget about him entirely and tries to delete everything about him in a last attempt to keep doing his job (keep Sunny away from bs and the truth). Also what else could OMOCAT do? Humphrey exists and is quite entertaining, should Aubrey just say "No sir, we can't find whatever we were looking for so let's go to that one abondened house south of the playground" and abruptly skip to BS?
he looks like he listens to weezer
real
best answer
i ❤️  hes gen a good character with good story and struggles he has to face throughout the game !!
struggles he brought upon himself?
Not to be rude,  it people bring struggles apon themselves all the time, that shouldn’t make you imidiatly dislike them
Yeah, but people dont >!fake other peoples suicides!< all the time, just saying. Besides, it's my opinion.
dude he was 12
And scared
literally just watched some super traumatic shit
At least we Agree with each other
truth
Basil was a scared kid who watch there best friend push his sister down the stairs. He didn't want to betray his friend and didn't want both of them to get in mager trouble so he set the whole thing up. Sadly we know what happens after that
Basil was having an panic attack, I’ve had them before, one of my worst ones I had (without getting into details, it’s hard to talk about this stuff without sounding like a depressed 14y/o). .  I locked myself in the bathroom (I never would lock myself away) for hours, screaming about how I wanted to kill myself. Even though I knew my parents weren’t angry anymore (I could hear them crying). . There were a thousand and one things I could’ve done, but I didn’t, because i was having a panic attack. And that was about me being scared of my parents, imagine how much worse it would be if the panic attack was started by watching your best friend kill his sister. . In a nutshell, the idea of doing nothing or calling 911 would never even cross their minds let alone be considered. So if you genuinely hate a traumatized 12 year old with pre-existing anxiety issues having a panic attack for staging a suicide than your being a bit closed minded here
This is so true. There was one day when I was about 13 (not that much older than Basil) when I had a panic attack because I forgot my P.E kit at home and I was scared that I was gonna get in trouble. I could’ve done the rational thing and called my parents saying I forgot my pe kit and they deliver it to the school, but my brain went on full shutdown mode and I was just there on my knees and tearing out my hair crying for a lesson that doesn’t even have its own exam. I can understand why Basil staged Mari’s death for Sunny. Sunny is his best friend, and obviously doesn’t want him to get sent to Juvie or abandoned by Aubrey, Hero and Kel. He wanted to protect Sunny, even if it meant lying about his sister‘s death. (Also, I dont buy Basil knowing how to make a noose before the whole situation. He had to have been dealing with his own demons before the Something’s came along. Which would’ve progressively made his depression worse.) So, in the middle of a panic attack, he helped Sunny to stage Mari’s death, and that takes a lot of work for someone who isn’t mentally stable in that moment to do.   . . . Uh. Yeah. That’s it. And why I love Basil.
Tbf most people here aren't psychologists
Everyone is being really sensitive about what I've said, I'm stating my thoughts and getting argued against.  . . . First off, I suffer frog trauma and anxiety so it's not like I have absolutely no clue of how it works, I have constant panic attacks and suffer from bad mental illness which had me in a mental hospital a few months ago.. . Also, I think differently to other people, I have autism, and sometimes I don't catch on to certain things and I react differently, I try looking at things from other peoples point of view before giving an opinion, to make sure it's fair and reasonable, but when it came to Basil's situation, all I'd be thinking is "we need to find help". . And before anyone says "he was scared of losing Sunny", I have attachment problems too, but if the person I cared about push someone down the stairs, on purpose or not, I'd still look for help.. . Don't make me feel guilty for disliking a fictional character who, to be honest, I have a lot in common with mentally, and I'm not being closed minded, I just think differently, so people, please stop putting me down for one single discussion.
Ah yes, his childhood abandonment and deep-seated attachment issues were all his fault!
Yeah but that was an accident though, where as what Basil did was on purpose, whether it had good intentions or not, it was a bad action to take, that's what I'm saying.
He literally wasn't able to say no, he wasn't conscious enough to be able to. >!Immediately after Mari hit the ground he started to fall into a catatonic state, hell at that point he literally wasn't able to recognize that Basil was there. He continued to fall deeper into that catatonic state, to the point where he was just blindly following the directions Basil was giving him. For note, the photos are Basil's perspective, while the descriptions are Sunny's perspective. 
~~>!Mari was hung because of him!<~~. . he is Basil, so maybe he was born with that special attribute
It’s weird seeing people blame Basil for >!Mari’s death!< when Sunny is the one who >!killed her!<, not Basil.
A lot of people care more about vibes than reality. If something is in bad taste they'll view it worse than something that is just actually bad.
Ik they're so silly 
Anyone who hates this guy ->  is a heartless being
Yeah...we don't have enough time to see how the incident affected Basil,one of the many reasons why aubrey Is my favorite character is how human she is,we can see how her life just shifeted after >!Mari Death!< while Basil? He dosent have enough screen time to see how his life fell apart.
What he deserves: snuggles. . What he gets: struggles
basil is the little silly scrimblo
because omori fans dont understand omori characters. . also i dont know how anyone can hate him anyway! hes so cute!
Exactly! How could anyone even hate him?
TW for all topics discussed in omori (s/h, depression, etc..) stay healthy everyone!!. . . yes i am going to make another comment explaining basil because i can and will.. . most people who dislike basil may feel this way because:. . >!- he did come up with the idea to hang mari.!<. . >!- many perceive him (also sometimes sunny-) as these heartless and cruel characters. he must of slashed sunny’s eye because basil is an evil mastermind. /s!<. . >!- he really doesn’t have as much screen time as the others, which honestly is a . valid reason (basil dlc when??)!<. . >!- people don’t understand his actions and feelings.!<. . >!- omori fans hate when characters who are mentally ill show signs of being mentally ill.!<. . >!all jokes aside, basil is a morally grey character. one of the major discussions left up for debate in omori is whether fans forgive sunny and basil. i’ll try to help others understand basil, but this comment won’t be perfect so if anyone has input i’ll be glad to hear it!!!<. . >!a lot about basil is hinted/ heavily implied but not directly shown. we can tell that a lot of his actions come from the desire to protect and to not lose the things and people he cherishes in his life.!<. . >!basil is made out by those who don’t quite get him to be someone who is extremely possessive and who has ASPD. the thing is, basil shows so much remorse and guilt for what he did. he never reacted to the incident that way he did just for shits and giggles. there is a reason why his panicked mind did that. during the time of the incident, both sunny AND basil were not thinking clearly or rationally. they were in a traumatic situation and were acting on their fight or flight responses. in no way am i saying what basil did was the best choice, but he wasn’t able to think his actions out. remember, he didn’t even think sunny was capable of doing that. in basil’s head, something did it and not sunny.!<. . >!basil wasn’t even mentally sound before the incident. his first trauma response was literally to stage mari’s death as a suicide. if that’s basil’s first reaction, that brings up MANY concerns.!<. . >!let’s make a quick list of things basil was suffering/dealing with before the incident.!<. . >!- his grandma (who was the only adult figure active in his life) was becoming more and more sickly.!<. . >!- parents weren’t involved in his life at all.!<. . >!- it’s said that he vented to sunny often, so he had at least some sort of issue.!<. . >!again i am going to restate that i’m not saying what he did was right or the best option, but he wasn’t aware of what he was doing or how it could be wrong. something did it, he is sure of that. now he has to protect the only other thing he has in his life.!<. . >!in the real world i do wish we saw a little more of basil, but it does make sense why we didn’t since basil is dealing with the truth as well. focusing on him would reveal the twist of the story. we know sunny never came outside in the four years, but basil had. he and sunny lived with what they did every second of the day, but basil didn’t cope with sleeping. he probably slept too little thinking about his actions. basil is clearly struggling and felt terrible. he didn’t tell anyone as that would defeat the purpose of protecting sunny. along with his anxiety, he saw constant shadows and reminders. in the three days we see his signs that he is suicidal.!<. . >!basil already had the intention to kill himself, but was holding out. as soon as he knew sunny was there, he felt more at “ease” knowing he was safe. then, he gives sunny his photo album. but kel states that sunny, the only comfort and reason basil had to live, is moving. this change is something that hits basil hard.!<. . >!a day later when basil tries to apologize to aubrey for something he didn’t do, he almost drowns. (one day i will go on a rant about my love for aubrey too. i am an avid aubrey and basil defender 💪)!<. . >!basil’s grandma going to the hospital is the final straw for basil. locking himself in his room, he has officially made up his mind. the bullying and the grief he was experiencing pushed his feelings. everything he cared about is gone. the guilt and anxiety are too much. the visions and the depression as too much. but then sunny comes to save him.!<. . >!during the fight, both sunny and basil are anxious messes and are breaking down. basil wasn’t meaning to stab sunny’s eye. he wanted to stab SOMETHING. the something that caused this whole mess. he wanted sunny to be safe. basil was deep into his psychotic depressive state and could not tell what was real and fake. ultimately his plan was NOT to kill sunny. basil’s plan was to get rid of the something who killed mari. the something who ruined his photos. after that, he would kill himself.!<. . >!basil is an incredibly complex character, and it’s very hard to understand his morals and reasons for what he does. my poorly written essay doesn’t cover everything about his character. the overall message of omori is that a bad thing you did doesn’t make you a bad person. everyone is allowed to like or dislike a character, my comment/info dump about basil was more of an explanation and exploration of basil and his character!!!<. . also, babil. enough said <3 🌸
He made piñata night, If you know what I mean
People don’t like mentally ill people and children aren’t good at nuance and that pretty much sums it up with this subreddit.
so real for this
I dunno, I just think he doesn't get a lot to work with compared to the other friends outside of Spoilers.
He called me bulbous like a tulip when I first started the game and I never got over it.
Anyone who hates basil completely missed the whole point of the game
To be fair, people aren't good at understanding other people doing bad things.
[best answer]()
Most important part for those who wont just read the whole thing:. . “The point is.. you cannot understand mental health unless you’ve experienced it. Therein lies the key to the hate people have for Basil. They look at his decisions through the point of view of a “regular” person with a clear state of mind.” . . Aka, Basil is hated because his problem’s are so heavily misunderstood.
I haven't clicked the link yet, but I'm betting it's that one really amazing detailed comment paragraph in the post about basil hate
>!wtf I'm right!<
Because no one actually played the game
I don’t. He is one of my favourite characters ever . . >!they way the game showed anxiety using his character is really well done and actually very realistic in my opinion!<
Because he can be liquidated and sold for profit 
Because he's French
I thought he was British
I don’t know what your talking about, I love pesto man
They want him for their soup :(
Trying to draw his hair is an absolute nightmare that’s why
I don't hate him I just would've preferred >!if he hadn't disguised the ayo pizza here incident with a suicide!< 
Well.. . >!He fucking hung Mari.!<. . >!When a smarter thing to do would be to leave the dman body near the stairs!!<. . >!Yea that's right Basil you fucking idiot! That's why your parents aren't here, because you can't even cover up your fucking crime!<. . Btw those aren't my words I remember someone talking like this
Dude imagine you are a traumatized kid who never fit in until you met a bunch of nice people who became your closest friends then you see one of your friends do something traumatic like that. In that moment he was terrified he was not in control anymore his body and he said the first thing that came to mind.
Look I was being sarcastic. Of course, he was fucking 12! So I'm not blaming him for coming up with what he did
You would be surprised how many people don’t realize the mind of kids especially in games
Especially when faced in a traumatic situation, their brains are still developing and then they face this. What can they do?!
Even adults make crappy choices like that
But especially kids since they weren't even taught how to deal with it
He was a child and trauma shuts down rational thinking
I know. And he was 12. So I'm not blaming him for coming up with what he did
Why would you repeat said words if you didn't agree with them even a *little* bit?
Yes.
It was such a raw deal that he had too, it was a terrible thing to do but he was honestly was just trying to be a good friend when it comes down to it
This just popped up in my home page but all I have to say is FUCK YOU BASIL YOU STILL OWE ME 20$
Whoever hates him missed the point of the omori lore imo
I don't hate him in particular >!but he kinda escalated the problem?!<. . >!Don't get me wrong I know kids around 12 (even some adults) cannot think rationally in such situations !<
I don't think 12 year old think "hey, let's >!hang your dead sister on a tree and make it look like suicide!!<"
And what? You think two scared children would choose to turn themselves in to police who won’t listen to their explanation instead?. . If a 12 year old breaks a cookie jar after stealing a cookie from it, do you think they’re gonna go tell their parents what they did knowing they’ll get in trouble for it? . . Or would they instead try to pick up the broken pieces and hide the evidence of what they actually did so they don’t get in trouble?. . Kids are always afraid of getting in trouble with authority and will think of anything they can to avoid getting caught. Basil’s logic makes more sense as a child than it would if he was older.. . In his own mind, he thought he was helping Sunny. If he turned Sunny in, Basil wouldn’t get in trouble, only Sunny would. So logically Basil thinks he’s doing the right thing by helping his best friend instead of betraying him.
I'm gonna be completely honest, I'd confess to breaking the cookie jar, I'm different y'know. My bad for not being 'normal' I guess.
What you’re doing is exactly the reason you can’t understand Basil. You’re looking from an outside perspective and saying “well if it were ME then I wouldn’t do that!” When if you were actually in the same situation in real life it’d probably be a different story because there would be a lot more variables added to the situation. . . It’s really easy to claim you would have handled Basil’s situation (or any situation) differently when looking from an outside perspective, but when you’re actually in a situation like that yourself, rational thinking becomes much more difficult, it’s all psychological.. . Also yeah everyone is different bro, idk what you’re on about with that “I’m different, I’m not normal” thing. Doesn’t really have much to do with the topic, I was just using an example to say that the majority of kids wouldn’t want to get caught doing something bad by their parents because that is true most of the time. . I wasn’t talking about you specifically, I’m talking about the mass majority of people. I’m also talking about kids, 12 year olds, not you. (Unless you are 12 and just happen to be ignoring the age rating of the game for some reason)
I'm not 12, and when I said I was different, I have autism, if I did something wrong, I'd own up to it, I've always been the different one, so don't blame me for thinking and acting different to other people, and I have been in several horrific situations, but I've handled them mostly in a rational way, the only times I haven't is when I haven't got the chance to and I'm immediately blocked of from the problem because help is already there.. . I appreciate what you're saying, but it would be nice if you accepted that I just don't think that way rather than arguing and proving me wrong.
Just because you have autism and may be different from the majority in some ways doesn’t mean you can accurately predict exactly how you’d be in a hypothetical situation that hasn’t actually happened. Anyone can say they’d do something the right way in a made up scenario since it can’t be proven if it’s hypothetical.. . I don’t care if you have autism, because I do too, I differ from most people in a lot of ways too but that doesn’t exempt me or anyone else from the will to lie. You can still lie even if you’re autistic. You don’t need to flaunt how “different” you are, we’re all different.. . You told me you aren’t 12, therefore my example from before was not talking about you. My example was used in reference to what happened with Basil and Sunny because they were 12 years old when it happened. You are not in the pool of people that fit my example so I do not care how you’d act in the situation of my example because I am not talking about you in it. . . I’m talking about children who accidentally do something bad and have to quickly think of what to do next on the spot. That’s what Sunny and Basil had to do, and they didn’t have time to think about their actions before taking them. It was all sudden, and no matter how you THINK you’d act in that situation, you’d never actually know until you’re in it.. . >!So until you witness an actual murder right in front of you irl, maybe don’t judge Basil for something you’ve never even experienced yourself.!<. . I don’t care if you think you’d act differently, you’ve had all the time in the world to think about how you’d handle his situation, and that’s not fair because Basil didn’t have that much time to think in a rational manner. (Also he’s a character, if he did the “right thing” then the game wouldn’t exist. Basil needed to do the worst option for the game to exist and be what it is.)
Dude, autism is different for everyone, and in my case, I legit can't lie.I have an opinion and you disagree, that's not an excuse for you to make be out to be a bad and thoughtless person.. . You also need to remember the post said "why do people hate basil", I was answering the question based on what I think people hate about him, and this is my thoughts based on speaking to people about it previously, so excuse me for answering the question rather than answering "why shouldn't people hate basil". . I don't hate basil, I do it for the memes, stop being so serious all the time, I'm just answering honestly, and if you have autism, then you should understand it affects everyone honestly, don't say I can lie just because you can.
Ah extremely depressed one would, as it’s hinted in game he was already pretty messed up *before* the incident^TM
Finally, someone with a different opinion that *isn't* trying to put me down about it. I appreciate the response. Xx
All I see is a very depressed boy who thought he had an amazing idea at the time.
i love bagel
Basil is the best character
his weird hairstyle
He’s British
This questionis asked every few moths on this sub. The answear is always the same: He is a pretty controversial character, havr done some messed up stuff but as much as some people hate him for it, it seems that even more people love him.
Poor basil i just want him to be respected
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO TASTE SMH
I love  he a lil spoinky loinky
I love him
How can anyone hate such a simple creature
Basil can be hated for different reasons but people got to understand that hay children can experience traumatic things in media and act in different ways just like reality. . I sort of hate basil as more as a joke . . Also. How to cook basil:. Step one: get basil. Step 2: freeze them. Step 3: put them on the pan and cry them. Step 4: add them ontop of a egg with stuff ( like ketchup ). Step 5: enjoy !
I love Basil ❤️ he’s my favorite silly goober
babil
He breathed (burn him) 
I can understand if people hate Basil. >!Faking Mari's suicide was his idea. Sunny was too distressed to take any coherent action in the hours after her death. If not for Basil, Sunny's parents would have come home and seen Mari's death for what it was, and Sunny's denial of what happened would have been cut short straight away. The arising of Something to haunt Basil and Sunny was ultimately Basil's fault first and foremost.!<
i could beat him up
I don't hate him. . It's probably because he wasn't fleshed out enough and it's so easy to hate on him
He is annoying
because he’s just like me fr
Basil=Bad. . Me and my homies don't like basil
Basil fans after seeing him do the most atrocious thing in the entire game: "wow I really wonder why people dislike him :(
Top five reasons why i hate him. . 1) i just feel like it. . 2). . 3). . 4). . 5) he smelly doo doo
dumb loser ugly uhhh bad
why does everyone think everyone hates basil? those people are just a vocal minority.
I think some people think he’s too clingy or they blame the incident on him, which is wrong. I actually love basil. He’s my favorite character and sunflower is my favorite ship. Downvote me to hell, I don’t care.
Based
Idk I love basil and can't understand why people like Aubrey so much? It's all about opinions I guess.
Basil is a pretty great character. But i do think the interpretation of him being a insane maniac is funny, even if its not remotely true
I love the lil guy actually, find him the most relatable character I’ve seen in a while for me
same here- though some of the things he's done aren't the greatest, there are still those aspects about him i can't help but relate to- abandonment issues, anxiety, innocent front- i can understand the relation :\]
Who is everyone
because everyone secretly likes him
“Everyone” doesn’t include me.
Basil is just fun to pick on . . I thought it was just a funny haha “pretend to hate basil” running gag sorta thing in the fandom because he seems like the type who would get bullied anyway, but I think people started misunderstanding the jokes as genuine hate.. . I think some people just follow the crowd too easily and jump on the bandwagon of hate and that’s partially why sunflower is less popular now than it used to be when Omori first came out because a lot of people started actually taking the basil-hate joke seriously and now some people just genuinely hate him, despite Sunny is just as bad, if not worse.
Wrong, I love my boy
step 1 - >!have an accident!<  . step 2 - >!take a picture of it!<  . step 3 - >!get a rope and tie it to tree!<  . step 4 - >!take a picture of your new tree ornament!!<. . BONUS STEP!!!! - >!insert sharp object into eye socket!<
I dont
Femboy 
idk, hes one of my fav characters and also very cute
👩➰🌳
I would recommend putting a spoiler on that
I don't know how
Idk, I hate him as a joke. . I actually like him
i think hes a nice character but its fun to pretend i hate him
People hate him?
If I had to guess, it's because unlike sunny, who made a mistake in the heat of anger, basil made a somewhat calculated willful decision. Either that or they don't understand the theme of the game.
Some people weird I dunno
My reason: he iust looks hate-able. . . yes that's It
>! The only reason why is because he looks like a femboy and because he LITERALLY FUCKING CUT OUT OMORI'S EYES! !<
I don’t know if you missed >!one day left!< or something…. . >!but he kind of tried to kill us 😭!<
False. He tried to kill "something". You forget that he was not in the right headspace and was literally trying to help save you. Don't act like he's instantly a bad person for having these breakdowns.
I was moreso making a witty joke than doing a game theory analysis, but sure.
I have the exact same question but the other way around .Don't get me wrong without basil there's no Omori game so thank you basil .it more why people think he's not a bad guy . He is literally the bad guy in the game . Either I'm not saying that omori is a good guy . He is the one who make the plan for Mari to not lose sunny . I know he as  a bad family . My mother hit me (his mother hit her)  when I was a child does that give me right to be evil . Do I have to become evil or should I be the one who break the cycle . I think it not because I had a bad life when I was a kid that the people should pay for that . What you think ? . . Sry If my English is bad ...
I just want to punch his little crybaby face
Piss hair/j
He looks killable
I honestly hate Basil fans more, specially when they keep asking this question like he hasn't done enough awful things to warrant it like >!defiling the corpse of a friend, keeping the secret to his other so called friends and resorting to attempting murder-suicide over confessing, not to mention scarring Sunny for life!<. I also don't buy the mental issues people come up to justify it because for what little we know of him before pizza time he seemed to be a perfectly fine little boy, which I will at least concede in that giving him more screen time to perhaps highlight some of these issues before what he did would have helped him a lot.
He is annoying...remembers me of me as a kid.
He's a queer and also very annoying
Rope. . Homosex. . Cry
Indeed

Wait what.....did I say?
Wait no.....
what 
Wait what did I do wrong?please explain me
i dont know either 
I thought you hated him for being gay?
no. . 

🕋

Gravity is less in  12 & 7u 5$ footlong
He just looks so dropkickable
>!Simple:!< >!Rope!<
It's not his fault that he's a normal guy among based kids 
hey op how far are you into the game?
The fact that he’s hated makes everything involving him so much more funny though at least . . Like I remember I once wrote to his character ai and forced him to help me commit tax evasion and that was so funny because it was Basil. . At least something is good about this unreasonable hate
For me, it's the fact that I feel that he's not as developed as the rest of the characters in the story. I don't hate him, I just think he's a little over hyped.
I just don’t like his personality (RW)
Nobody hates Basil. What type of question is this? If there is any hate, it very tiny few people.
There are a LOT of people who hate basil. You'd be surprised.
Not everyone hate him, it's 50/50. . I hate him bcz it's fun (and he kinda made everything worse to everyone in the game)
Basil bby <33
I don't know if everyone (I particulary love him cuz he cute ❤️), but I think they do it because he commited fraud and they want him to pay with suffering (for example: 🍉)
Not everyone hates him . . Also: "Me explaining why some people hate Basil" (dude writing stuff on a whiteboard)
Ah the weekly post. Basil is bitht he most lived and hated character. He's divisive mostly due to his screentime being really minimal. I love the Babil but he's controversial
WAIT WHAT?!
Who hates Basil???
i dont tbh
Because they're immature and blame a child for being a traumatized child.
HES MT FAVORITE CHARACTER <3333
I actually thought he was a harmless little flower bud until I finally figured out >! the truth sequence around Three Days Left !<
❤️
I love basil, both as a relatable character, and as an interestingly written character
his favorite level is probably wasureta
We love Basil.  It's hard to explain but making fun of him is simply our way of expressing our love for him.  Kind of like when football players pour Gatorade on their coaches.
Mostly a joke
I don't, he's so cute
i mean look at him. look into those dead fish eyes and tell me you can't sense the evil coming from within
People either love him or hate him
he just got opps dawg
I don’t know why everyone hates him I like him
Who’s Basil?
PEOPLE HATE HIM?
I've been in this fandom for 3 years and huh I've never heard this
Whe not
i mean, i can understand the hate towards him and a lot of the points people have said are valid- but for me personally i've always just felt some sort of connection with his character. the innocent front with a deeper feeling and truth behind it- the abandonment issues- i don't know. looking past the inhumane things that's he's done, i feel like i can relate to some aspects about him that i just kinda feel drawn to. i mean, im not going to validate his actions because they were not the best by any means, but those are my reasons for why i like his character. everyone's opinion is unique though, and i respect those who don't like him and those who do :\] <3
just look at his stupid fucking face ugh god i wanna strangle him
Have you finished the game?
Don't hate him but he's underdeveloped in RW and DW
Because they’re dummies.
Basil?
The rizz can be hard to handle
I'm not sure. I think the little dude is pretty neat hes my favorite
Idk I'm tired I want to sleep I'm sick but it's only morning
hes puntable. . **very puntable**. . still love him though he scrunkly
Who said so? I love basil
Um....wtf??? I thought I had the whole omori story. Apparently I don't. Fuck, I love this game.
he’s too fucking cute
I just hate him so much! (I totally didn't just buy a plush of him and I don't draw him a lot and almost every account I own is based off him whattt nooooo)
I honestly just don't like flower boys. Period.. I have the same problem with Ralsei.. I also have friends who like these characters and for some reason the capital WHY?!s I receive when I say I don't like them is kind of funny.
He’s vegan
I just found him annoying, I don't know why
Cuz they never bothered to stop and step into his shoes. Look from his perspective.
Beats Me 
Probably because they don't understand him, or why he did what he did. I love Basil, he's one of my favorites, the only thing is that while playing the game (RW mostly), seeing how much he acts like me is a little fristrating (not ao much the abandonment issues part, but everything else). Still love him though. He also looks a little bit like me 
I really like Basil. I understand that people dislike him but man, he was 12 and panicked
Isn't basil A girl no boy decides Oh yeah Imma put a flower in my head
this is straight up missinformation
Personally, I don't hate him, making bad and toxic think doesn't mean you're a bad person but I had a very toxic best friend like him so he really scares me-
Because he is responsible for the tiananmen square massacre of 1989
Dunno
I really like Basil, I think he's my fave after everyone's fave which is Kel
Because he's vegan
i personally don't hate Basil, he is a cute and good character, but i don't understand the why of his hate. is because his crazy idea about the fake suicide of Mari? He did this because he wanted to protect Sunny, and when he saw Mari on the floor not moving, his mental healt and his thoughts just blowed up, he fell in panic, and instaured this sad scenario. Next when he looked at the hanging Mari s body, borned his trauma, the "something" that for Basil killed her. I think that Basil is too underrated and too hated whitout a concrete reason. He just needs some apprectation by his fandom. stop hating Basil 
how a 12-year-old boy thought of hanging a friend's dead sister to set up that she killed herself? Basil kinda psycho kid
I’ve heard people say that’s he’s bad because he’s did those horrible things in the past. which to me is funny, because he despises himself for doing that. Also, he was 12. He didn’t even know what was happening.
He’s my favorite 🙃
He’s my favorite pesto man. . The main reason people hate him is usually because they don’t understand how hard it is to think properly during trauma and panic attacks. (From experience involving panic attacks, i can safely say you do loose any form of rationality). And people dislike him for not having a lot of screen time (don’t see how that’s basils fault though, you can not like him for that but you shouldn’t hate him for that)
Because they're jealous they're not as cute as him
We are homophobic! 
**takes picture of dead body**. . Time to cri and be boring for a few years
Evil basil
I love him idk
Idk he reminds me of some toxic people i know irl and I guess it’s a common association
i personally like basil, so idk lol
He crybaby
I love my flowerboy I just also love to bully him sometimes
Homophobia /j
He silly
People hate Basil???? He's mine and my boyfriend and my roommate's favourite character.
He is NOT the waffle house's new host
Bc he gave omori the ideia and he had a crisis and got into a fight with him like it was omoris fault
Personally, i think most of the hate wouldn't even be a thing if we had gottem more screen time for Basil. He is... underdeveloped you could say.
I thought we've been through this already
Bro, why y'all hating on the precious femboy
 He doesn’t really have an aliby to cover up the murder
For sport
!<the hangman.>!
too fruity… (jk im bi)
I love him
Just play the game, plz
primal instincts
I love Basil, he's my favorite character and i relate to him a bit too much. But i can see why people don't like him.. . >!I mean, he hung Mari and he's the one getting upset when sunny leaves? It's a little fucked up but i guess it's understandable, they made a promise to stay together and sunny broke it, and well, I can't blame him but the incident+ this would've made almost anyone upset about it.!<. . But sincerely? He deserves better in this fandom. It's a bit upsetting he's getting that much hate. Let's all love bagel 
people are jelly
people hate basil? i thought you were shitposting
i hate children
\*ahem\*
I am opposite. He is a precious flower. Also painfully relatable :'D. . I have horrible social anxiety and attachment issues, other mental problems that are undiagnosed, but I do love nature and photography... actually I used to run off or try to get away as a kid, kinda like how Basil goes "missing" in the game.
I love Basil idk what you are talking about,I love this plant loving child 
because people who play this game have no media literacy and don’t know what nuance is
I'm at a complete loss in finding one person who *does hate* Basil. Like, have you seen r/Basilcult !?
But-. . but i love him-
because is gay and is a crying baby
he sucks. why else?
You hate basil because >!he hung mari.!< I hate basil because too many people like him. We are not the same.
He did several war crimes.  And kidnap the 15th president the United States of America and Russia & Force them into a death match /lh
You mean the best character, Basil? The one that I will fight for to death. That one? There is at least one person who hates him?
its because he go cri
Listen, I'm no Basil hater, but damn do elevators feel iconic now.
his head is a big lemon
…how’d she pronounce Basil?
BAY-SIL
Excellent
I always thought it was Bah-Sil...
The more you know :). . (it's totally fine that you thought that btw)

That's cool with me 👍 just know that it's canonically BAY-SIL

WATER ALL OF BASIL'S FLOWERS EVERYDAY
Doing that in my first playthrough hoping it matters was so satisfying
A quick question for the people that own the console version of the game. Is the card of Omori and Basil on every one of those?
yes 😁 there’s a different card in the ps4 version of them holing hands 
Do these always come with a basil tagged you card?? 🥹🥹 plsss I need to know
Pretty sure they do
For some reason, I get the feeling you like Basil
Ofc the guy with an Astolfo pfp has the Basil one 😾 (so do I :3)
real..
cool!. . I also have a Bagel in my shirr pocket too!. . 
I also have a Bagel! I bring them into my IT classes!. . 
yeah, im surprised i havent seen more people complaining about the quality drop. my basil's look pretty weird compared to my first wave plushes. Its pretty annoying tbh. they're still my little guys though
i thought my basil was bad when he came in because his hair is a little wonky, this is something else entirely😭
Had a similar thing. Had a Basil plush take weeks to arrive and then my friends were getting theirs. I then emailed support about it. To my surprise they then sent me another one... A month later the original one shows up from being lost in the mail.
..what? he’s clearly supposed to be wearing overalls in both photos. . 
I think they mean that the color is supposed to be different but is actually the same. If you look you can see that Real Life Basil's pants part of the overalls are brown but at the top they are teal. Dream World Basil's overalls are completely teal. I think they're pointing out that the top of Real Life Basil's overalls are the same color as Dream World Basil's when it's not supposed to be 👍
It's just the color that's weird.
Where's goku?

What?
for a second i interpreted it as him wearing a backpack
What?
it's the wrong color
I’m confused. Some say it’s the color but shouldn’t the real world version of Basil not have an overall at all? Like he has almost the same outfit as Sunny just that his vest (or whatever it is) I more green.. . Or am I tripping?

Yeah but that’s his past outfit. Why would he wear that one on the keychain when he otherwise looks like present Basil?
Okay, can someone help me out here? I see the big red circle but I can’t find Goku
Buddy that red circle is hella useless. You should've circled around ENTIRE cyan overalls, instead of a random ass part above the notebook.
I think what op is trying to say is that when hs basil wears over alls they are the same color, look at the bottom of the overalls, (the shorts) they should be teal too. Or basil should be wearing a green sweater/white shirt/ not overalls with brown shorts. It’s either a color or line work issue
Its obvious that is an impression error but it reminds me of some sort of those beckpacks to carry babys around
everybody is talking about colors (for some reason???) so for those who don't get it, FA basil doesn't wear overalls, he has a sweater vest
 I would have my Basil collection that big right now if I had the space
What was BASIL's face then?
yeah as far as i know pretty much all nendoroid parts are compatible, omori comes with a holding hands one that’s used with the basil nendoroid which would probably be really great if you wanted literally any other nendoroids ever to hold hands lol
ohh nice
Feed Basil with basil
yeah place him in an air fryer, bagels get hard in the microwave
Exactly
✿Basil looks like he’s going into a very cozy, loving home.  Honestly just take care of him the way you would any close friend. Godbless \~ :\] ( really though the house has such a nice vibe from what I can see. I feel all peaceful looking at the plants .)
thanks ! im so glad you like it <3
Make sure to water him every night and give him a good place to sleep! It worked for my Basil!!
Dont feed him the herb Basil, that's cannibalism lmao

Where do you buy the basil figure?
basil
it's also themed after basil & his garden, pretty sure. i mean, it's literally called the "home for flowers" cardigan (his home's theme)
Hate to break it to you, but it seems like your friend got a bootleg version, the official one has the good smile company logo
Ngl for a bootleg it looks fire
Sweet
Glad someone else loves the subtle design of the cardigan too! Only a real OMORI fan would recognize the flowers lol
WHY DORS EVERYONE HAVE THE PLUSHIES??
Because I like having cool stuff from things I like
No i mean why are they all in im still waiting for mine 🙏
Oh idk why then
i have the cardigan too!! i adore it so much, this is the exact kind of merch i love, so subtle
I might buy this ngl
I have this too!! Its the best piece of clothing I own
GOD i want that cardigan so bad but im so poor rn
I live on Australia and it’s like 70 USD for one plushie
Wow, that’s a lot more than $25.
whaaa such a cool bagel! also id love this cardigan whoa
Woooow that’s a nice cardigan. I kinda need one of those.
Well you also kinda need $80 (it’s expensive)
Yeah, I checked and it’s like, the most expensive one there. Plus my size is out of stock.
What can you tell us about size? I'm afraid of the wrong choice.
. . Same vibes
Maybe you can make basil tea. But i don't think he will approve of this...
Maybe he'll dissolve into the water before being able to state his opinion
In his natural habitat 
The harvest shall be plentiful this year
This is too cute 
Thanks, Miss Pauling
He shall make an exquisite drink
bro really mugged an innocent child.
He keeps running away so I had to

He will grow into a watermelon
Hes gonna grow into a big boy
A cup of Basil.
Contained
He will grow into a marvelous watermelon
is he growing
Now pour oil over it and set it on fire
Microwave it
That's just something that seems to be an issue past the initial plushie launch. You could return it and get a new one if you want, or you could have your own unique Basil, despite its flaws!

Relatable, lol

I love basil!! Im working on my collection little by little.
You see Basil is actually the perfect creation of God and Aubrey is the anti-christ
ur actually supposed to interact with him, ur missing out on important dialogue every morning.
The funniest thing to me (besides the hilarious caption) is that there are several other figurines next to Basil yet he’s the only one who’s glowing
First time I woke up and saw that I thought I was having a fever dream
Such a happy little guy 🥺
Basil was shining
Don't let him perform photosythesis, he will become too powerfull.
um ACTUALLY, he WAS chosen by god ☝️😌✨
He’s glorious
"You are my sunshine..."

Basil is actually the chunkiest one here. He is the recipient of the most head trauma.  :)

Basil. I love the colors of him. He is my little baby
Omori because silly monochrome goober. But I genuinely don't feel attached to the Headspace plushies as much compared to the Faraway plushies since they aren't actual characters except Omori. That said, I have been calling HS Basil and Omori my children since the day they came home.
100 what? bananas? kuwait dinars? basils?
Clams
Same here! :D
. . My babil says hi to him
That is way too cute I love that
thats nice
Mine also arrived today but I'm on holiday so I'm picking him up at the post office when I get home
He's a precious precious baby boy
Same here! He’s so cute and silly I love him
Looks like ur favorite character is basil, but Im not sure
i think you might be right tbh
Basil look like a grandpa with that hairline. And Omori looks like he’s completely bald 
Is that Basil or is that Fentanil wtf.
Nah that's Parsley 
Right!!! I thought I was going crazy
They seem to be getting worse and worse quality every restock for some reason. The amount and severity of these defects just gets bigger every time and I don't know how 😭🥺
im scared mine will turn out like this
Skin walker basil
i hope this isnt a permanent change 😭😭
Weren't the old plushies made by a different company?
Evidently so, but still using the original product pictures is wild lol
I just bought a bunch of new ones because I didn't think the QC would be that different.... 😭😭😭
I just ordered every RW plushie. I pray they don't look like that. 💀
Hes just a lil derpy bean
Yeah my basil has long hair😭😭😭
Looks like there’s a new company making them. *Thank god I still have the ‘high quality’ ones…*
I have headspace Basil old wave and he’s awesome. I’ve also bought Faraway Basil and Sunny wave 1 and they’re also awesome. But I ordered faraway Aubrey wave 2 and now you’re scaring me.
I’m so sorry, I hope your Aubrey doesn’t come as chopped as my Basil 💔

“WHY DOES BASIL HAVE ALL THE WEED”
Hello, anthony basiltino here
Fantano gives Pale Machine a Light 7
It's one of the default anime-girl poses (the other one is one Basil also does, which is the sitting-on-lower-legs-with-feet-out-the-back one).. . It's easier for the more flexible to do this; that flexibility is more commonly found in women than men, but is by no means exclusive.
Basil is not beating the femboy allegations

they wanted to please the fan who see Basil as a femboy
Wait he isn't?
he pretty much is idk why they phrased it like that
Because some people think femboy = skirt and thighhighs even though femboy just means feminine boy
bro is a femtologist
As a fellow femboy, he is right. Its not always skirts and thighhighs
it's like 50% attitude
As another fellow, yeah, but most usually gravitate towards that style which is a shame :<
Femtologist is my new dream job
Reserve the simping for teenage basil. . Smol bagel must be protected and given headpats 5x daily
I second this motion.
I third this motion except we probably shouldn’t be simping for anyone younger than us
This guy …… this guy right here has been factually correct
Reserve the simping for... *teenage* basil?. . I need to see your computer folders
heaven forbid high schoolers date or have crushes-
It's just that saying "reserve the simping for teenage [character]" is in general just a weird thing to say, did you even think twice before even saying this?
I understand your concern, but… not really? Teenagers aren’t stupid, we know what romance is.
Because Basil always deserves the cutest art!
I'm pretty sure the artist must've thought about Fire Emblem's Nino then mixed her and BASIL up.
basil has always been pretty zesty in headspac
They found that Basil was too aesthetically pleasing for them to handle, so they came to complain on the Internet.. . That's all that's happening here.
Bagel
FemBasil
Bagel peets :3
What does the word peets mean??
Why is he a twig??? I always imagined Basil to be chubbier 😭
. . This is literally his official artwork. How could you POSSIBLY imagine him being chubby at all????
Huh, weird? I guess it was more of a headcanon?
Fair enough
These head cannons always confuse me, if Basil existed today, he’d follow ThatVeganTeacher
If you thought that Basil was gay, then you ain't see nothin' yet
ik, I'm talking to people who think only bagel is drawn gay as fuck

also it's BASIL, not bagel*. . <3
that's a nickname a lot of people in the community call him by
I know??
Then why correct them?
ik
Basil's Grandmother: "Basil what are you watering?". . Basil: "Pot.". . Basil's Grandmother: "Pots of what?". . Basil: "Pot. I not getting rid of it.". . Basil's Grandmother: "Are you kidding that Sh**'s great for my glaucoma"
In the end, Basil's grandma didn't go to heaven.. She went higher
Can we get much higher?
basil is 100% not one of them
this is what I always say: feminine guys who are straight exist, but Basil Omori is not one of them.
Basil has obvious attachment issues from being abandoned.
They feminized the shit out of Basil he wasn't THIS feminine in the game 😭
Basil is more visible than the rest.
I personally don't care for this shipping stuff, but it would be the funniest thing on the planet if after all this, Basil turned out to be straight.. . The shockwaves in the fandom would be biblical.
>Basil turned out to be straight.. . I'm pretty sure this is the case.  . . I think he's comfortable/intimate with Sunny (and vice versa) for reasons that are gender-neutral, in ways that can include the physical, but don't depend on them (like they do for Aubrey).  Their relationship wouldn't be meaningfully different if Basil was the opposite sex- human beings require relationships like that, and Sunny/Basil just happens to fill that need for each other the best (to the point that Sunny is irreplaceable to Basil- more important to him as he's a lot more alone).. . It's difficult to explain to people (especially those who are unable to think outside of the orientation box); you either understand it or you don't.
Friendly reminder (just in case) that this Basil is based on a 12-year-old CHILD.
Yup, but again people don't care about that details unfortunately.
The posts themselves don’t get removed, but my comment discussing it does? This sub is funny
I’d be mad if there was a panel where Basil didn’t look like the gayest man on Earth. I would feel scammed(despite not paying) and question reality.
i might be the gayest im just not a man ><;. .   . ...well... Ok actually im plantgender, so i'm the toric-est flower on earth, but um, if there's a gayest boy on earth it's probably a basil somewhere ><
Yeah and like I said before, if every Omori fan  can think like that they would be no... problems if I can say that.
...i'm not sure i understand ><;
Forget it, nothing important.
o-ok ><;;;. .   . Have a nice day \^\^
Thanks \^\^! and be careful with gardening tools okay?
Thank you, i will sir(or whatever honorific you prefer) ><;; <3
Call me Max and please be careful with people here, okay?
We are! don't worry, max ><. .   . I know im smol and gentle, but i can take care of myself. and if i can't, i have friends who can<3
Perfect perfect, if you have understand anything, be with your friends and have a delicious picnic \^\^.
The artists really made Basil's pop in this NGL
It's kinda creepy how Basil always has bedroom eyes or behaves overtly feminine.
That’s what I’m sayinggg. It’s weird honestly.
It's, like, almost sexualised how he's always put in really promiscuous poses. Far from how cutesy he was portrayed in the game. He just looks flirty all the time.
. . Basil live reaction to this information:
Does anyone have a pic of Basil smoking weed? I feel like it would be appropriate for this post
peak basil
They understood the assignment with Basil's character
I don’t think he looks gayer than he already is. Basil’s always been a little fruity, or perhaps ”flowery”?
I think this is much more vissible here.
It’s kinda making me dislike Basil. I hate the bedroom eyes on him, it’s weird.

Man idk but it's my profile
To be fair, this is how Sunny envisions Basil.
Best friend rizz
This manga really likes making Sunny see Basil as zesty as hell



 Gaysil
Because Sunny really envisions Basil like that

This is not just femboy, that is a fucking "i am telling you bro, i am boy" case
I THOUGHT HE WAS HOLDING A GUN
"When even your creator treats you like a femboy" :V
Lmao

Why is he so cute????
god nui is doing an awesome job dgm but i dont think shes ever held a camera before. you can't just press it between your fingers like a phone they're like as heavy as a laptop
WAIT WHERE DO YOU FIND THISSS
He's SCHEMIN'.

Nui's a creep, he's a weirdo
What the hell is he doing here?
he doesn't belong here
He's still very masculine to me to be honest.
nah I can't refer to this mf with male pronouns anymore 😭
When I bring this up I get downvoted, when someone else does it they get upvoted we live in a society
Why wasn't Basil a girl from the first place?? damn you omocat 😭
They already made Fem Kel once and the fandom was crazy at the time... Basil can't go through the same thing
Someone's gotta say it.... . Basil looks adorable
Agreed! I would protect him with all my heart! 
Yeah me too :3
smh they all do
I would also like to mention that it looks like Basil and Sunny are holding hands in the photo

Valid take.
Why did I think Basil was for some reason the medical bill? 😭
They should have sold one of his eyes to Pay the bill, no Idea why eye specifically thou
They billed Basil's parents.
Plus it was the 90's. Health insurance was cheaper beyond just inflation.
All Basils are cute Basils !
Alternate dimension Basil who was a basic bro and only watch football and eat boneless wings

I still fully believe Sunny is a bi disaster pining after Aubrey and Basil simultaneously, maybe just not knowing that he loves basil like that
Idk why you're getting down votes, its almost all but confirmed at this point
What you should be asking is. Why did Omori imagine Basil looking at him like that. That's HeadSpace Basil, remember? ;)
What if instead of Omori it was

reminder that this basil is a complete figment of Sunny's imagination. . HE imagined Basil looking at him like that
Reminder that he also imagined them holding hands and walking together

The way they drew him here is very off model. I have no idea why they gave him sultry eyes instead of maybe a timid smile. It's weird and sorta offputting.
Gay ass
He’s Rizzil instead of Basil
same
Bro’s got the bedroom eyes
he's TWELVE
Sunny is dreaming of 12-year-old Basil's bedrooms eyes then yikes
As soon as i saw the style i knew what the artist was

Pretty sure thats a petal or flower thing.
It could be, but it's such a conveniently shaped petal if it is one.
BASIL X OMORI CONFIRMED ???
i remember seeing the birthday art and going “hmmm”.
The birthday art?
For Basil’s last birthday, by the artist.
Ah I see
gay AS FUCK BOY
Why does lil’ bro have more rizz in his pinky than I do in my whole body . . He’s twelve how is this happening 

Basil so homiesexual he had to give Sunny the pretty homie stare (not gay tho)
hes being zesty....
Don't pretend you don't know the reason.
What 4 years of being with his Basil does to a person
Who’s Mahito? Basil with a gun?
The only readable one is Basils and im not very fluent in Japanese so I had get some of it from translate but it basically says . . Basil. . He's a very kind boy, but he can be easily influenced.. He was especially close with Sunny, but they haven't spoken to each other in four years.
Native Japanese speaker here. Your translation is very good!
ありがとう！I wasn't sure if it would be accurate because I haven't practiced Japanese in almost a year 
Thank you!
You're welcome :)
>Thank you!. . You're welcome!
You didn't translate it
wait what is that bot
Idk
oh
Yeah sorry but that bot is annoying tbh
haha why sorry, but anyways i see..
No, your wrong! It says ‘Hey guys, Basil here. Don’t forget to look for the gummy bear album in stores on November 13th for lots of music videos and extras’
don’t downvote this guy he’s right
I can read Japanese. Do you have better pictures of the introductions? I can only make out Basil's from this angle.
I can't find any onther images of this promotion... but thank you for trying to help me
Looks like this is at the Animate in Ikebukuro. I don't live in Japan so I can't go to see it, and no other pictures are online as far as I can tell... Maybe on Twitter but I don't have an account. It looks like others have translated the legible ones for you, but if you do find a better picture online and need help translating, feel free to let me know.
He's so pretty wow
Bro be lookin so gay
where can i get the print version?!

Darn 
Better get a vpn or a ticket
This gives off massive gay vibes I’m sorry.

The pacing is different, its at basils house
No, just everyone else.. . >!The only one strong enough to kill Basil is Basil.!<
Ok
You mean watermelon?
I know. Basil isn't my comfort character
Sorry for assuming but it’s just weird to hear someone say that and not mean it you know
That's why I put quote marks?
Well 🤬my visually impaired 🤬
. . Basil would use him as fertilizer
Inaccurate, Sukuna would melt just by being near Basil’s spiritual pressure like he’s Aizen.. . 
This is just wrong, but who am I to think something good would happen to Basil in this fandom? I wanted to make this comment even more overly dramatic but I can’t think of anything else to say.
Dude. Why does EVERYONE want to fucking kill basil. *Sad expression*
Basil you need to use RCT, stat!
incorrect bagelw ould actually solo
NOOOOOO BAGEL NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭why
I just felt Basil's presence..
in another panel if I remember correctly seen next to Basil she looks like a giant so either the artist messed up a bit the heights or Basil is literally EXTREMELY tiny
!?. . Basil’s writing is so similar to mine
The way that the kids are drawn (especially Basil) is really weird and inappropriate frankly. Nui Konoito needs their hard drive checked if you catch my drift.
This artist has already been exposed for a while.
I think I read about that somewhere but I’m out of the loop. I just don’t get why there isn’t a larger community-wide condemnation of what’s going on here, it’s so obviously reprehensible.
Honestly I don't know why either, and the artstyle makes me uncomfortable just the way they drew Basil.
 art style screams fujoshi. its so uncomfortable to look at the gang and know that theyre drawn like this because the artist gets off to little kids
Agree.
Mixed but open.. . I think it's interesting that they're remixing some things in the story but I think chapter 1 was too rushed. Chapter 2 was better in my opinion but we'll see how the series is from here on out. I don't know how long this series is going to be and I'm worried they're going to squish plot elements/character development too much.. . I will say that the art style is both pretty and weird. I do like it but at the same time, I'm uncomfortable with how... suggestive (?) some of the characters are drawn, especially Basil. It's really weird.
ngl overhatted, the artstyle is rlly good...except for Basil's face in that one panel
Am I the only person who literally kinda fw with it. . (ignoring Basil's bedroom eyes)
>!I love how Basil yells for Omori's help rather than how it is in the game.!< It hints that there is a deeper stronger connection between Basil and Sunny better imo
Mhm!. . >!The scene where he finds the picture is also interesting. Since this is manga, you can stare at the photo for as long as you want. So, instead of the violin, Something was shown instead. The friends are shown looking at Basil and acknowledging the fact that Basil is being pulled by the black tendrils of Something, and I think that is a little different from what I’ve seen is implied in the game so far. I thought that they were not able to see things like this. I wonder if their memory of it will be erased next time Omori visits Headspace…!<
>!I wonder if they'll do that thing from the pre-release version of the game where the others could see the 26 keys too!<
Overall I really liked this chapter! I love how they skipped all the hide and seek stuff and went straight into Boss fight. I think it’s a nice and refreshing change. . . I also like the small changes in Basil’s dialogue when the photo was discovered. Also a nice change! . . Really looking forward to future chapters! 
I find it interesting that >!the entire hide-and-seek section of the game wasn’t here, with Boss capturing Basil during a picnic instead!<
Omori fans getting ready to call Basil the funny thing cause he called out to omori despite the fact that he's basically being eaten alive by repressed hurt and his past actions . . They're so cutie goatedcel core lovers 🥰
seeing basil happy brings me immense joy
Frfr
Cause Basil is the ultimate cute, simple. He has a similar effect to that of a black hole where he distorts the visual art of the series he’s in and makes everyone cute character.
Probably the whole “going to Basils house”
so long as Basil gets more pages I don’t really care
W basil enjoyer

I'm in that subreddit lmao

Holy fucking shit you replied fast lol. I'd barely left the comment section and you've already replied lol
Bc I was already on Reddit lol
Fair enough then


She was kinda the same as she was in the game, I don't remember her hitting basil but she was definitely being set up to be the main real world antagonist. Atleast
Can I just say Basil has BEDROOM EYES?! HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S ABOUT TO SHOW OMORI WHY IT'S CALLED HEADSPACE!!!!!!

AND HE'S 12
Omori and basil kiss
Not a Sunflower Shipper but I'd Love More Interactions Between Sunny and Basil,They Barely Talk with each other in the game which is Kinda sad since both of them are such a big part of the game. Honestly I guess I just want basil to be in the manga more in general
yeah i would also love to see more of basil because he is such a complex and interesting character but with the scope of the game i wonder how they would do it. i mean, the entire point of headspace and most of faraway town segments are to find basil, which means its integral for basil to be absent so i dont know how we would see much of him. i dont know how much this will follow the narrative of the game, but if it does i doubt we are going to see much of him. . . also happy cake day
same here bro. . happy cake day
don't forget the zetsy ass look basil panel 
bro goes to his nearest gun store to shoot that thing more than Basil in Basil’s Grief frfr
I thought they looked like Morphs, as in humanoids who have pale skin, yellow irises, and black-looking hair... while at the same time they're created from dead people's harvested quintessence. Say that BASIL somehow comes back but is a Morph created from exactly *his* quintessence, then one of the few differences you'd see is his eerily paled skin color.
WHY IS SOMETHING A DOOR FRAME’S FOOT OF HEIGHT TALL? . . Now I see why he ran back from the door during the >!confrontation with basil)!< on 1 day left.
Hey you mistyped your spoiler change it before you ruin someones playtrough
Oh god, thanks for catching that.
. . Basil has the Six Eyes
Basil becomed Ba/sil in one of the endings.
More like B/asil
Considering backspace more like B/a/s/i/l. Honestly he and kashimo would make good friends with both being farmers lol.

I'm pretty sure basil asks if he's okay at Basil's house but it's only if you go to interact with him a few times, because he's confused why you're not saying anything.
He’s the only one to notice, which is in character givin the story.
Ah fair enough. I do still think most of their designs look accurate for their ages. Basil is the only one who does look a bit too young for what makes sense
Sorry but it's def not accurate. Any 16 yo I knew (including myself 2 years ago) already looked like actual adults, not children like there. . I'm not trying to add to any controversy or anything, I honestly don't care, I think the artstyle is rly good overall but yeah no real 16 yo do not look like that at all (unless in some specific cases)
Honestly I personally enjoy the changes, but that’s mostly cause I’ve played the game multiple times so seeing a new take on the story is refreshing; plus it makes every page a new adventure. . . It was a bit off putting to pretty much start in the Real World aside from the dream sequence at the start, definitely feel like it was a misstep but it can also set up something amazing imo if played right. . . Like Sunny seeing RW Basil for the first time in years since >!the Incident!< can be what causes HS Basil to go missing, with Sunny’s mind trying to block out the memories associated with him. . . It would be cool if Chapter 2 Ended with the Photo Album scene in Basil’s House in Headspace.
Basil in the sixth image looks like in that goku meme
It's pretty bad.. Bad pacing, weird plot decisions, and for some reason they keep giving Basil really sketchy poses and bedroom eyes. Creepy.

Basil, honey, oh my ***god***, you don't know yet-
Just a question, do you have the comic translated by the time you upload the Korean version to DC, or is the work done after that?. . Also I love Basil with glasses 
Both the Korean and English versions are completed before I upload them. Everything is finalized before being posted.. . I'm glad you like Basil's design! Please look forward to Basil's role in the future, and thank you for enjoying my work !
I see. I gotta admit, your work is quite something else even within the global OMORI community. I am interested in… you know, but time is pretty scarce.
I’m not sure if I understood GPT’s translation correctly, but you mean it’s hard to find time to binge-read the comic, right? I hope it’s nothing more serious than that. Got it. I’ll keep working hard. Thank you for the compliment!
Ah no, I’m actually interested in the translation. Got little time for that.        . As for the comic I have binge-read the thing from start to now. And I’m happy you’re doing better now and back on track.
Ah, I see! In that case, let me share an interesting fact with you. . . I’m not always confident that my translations fully reflect my intended meaning. To make them feel as natural as possible, I use GPT to translate a page and then meticulously go over each paragraph to ensure it aligns with what I want to convey. Even so, I often wonder if it’s truly accurate.. . For parts where the nuance of Korean is almost impossible to convey in English, I’ve made adjustments to better fit the English context. If you’re interested in Korean, looking at these parts might be an insightful way to learn. Of course, studying different languages is seen as a basic skill in the U.S., but learning the language of a country on the other side of the globe is an entirely different challenge.. . I studied English in school, but even with basic concepts, I quickly realized how vastly different Korean and English are—even with simple words like "And," "But," "Because," "About," and "On." It helped me understand why basic translation tools often fail. Also, keep in mind that Korean has unique expressions that don’t exist in other languages. For instance, some onomatopoeic words in the Korean version of my work are either completely omitted or expressed differently in the English version.. . I understand how difficult it is to find time to study—I'm often frustrated with how little time I have to invest in my comics. But if you do give it a try, I think reviewing the parts I struggled with in the Korean version could be a helpful way to learn! Best of luck, and thank you for your interest!
Thank you! Maybe I’ll give this one a go.
I want to say one thing about Basil in this au... HE'S SUCH A DADDY🛐🛐🛐, HE LOOKS GROWN UP (EVEN HIS PANTS INSTEAD OF SHORTS CONFIRM THIS). . I like the fact that you broke the long-standing template of the Omari au and the fandom in general, that after Sunny's death, Basil automatically becomes an Emo undertaker, and in yours Basil becomes a normal (DADDY) guy with glasses and a normal future (albeit with a small drawback, because even though you broke the template, I don't see any emotional damage in him, even though he is morally strong, he should have received damage)

You know the day will be good when the new Hakari drops. . Holy shit, evil Bagel was a lie
That’s such a sweet thing to say—thank you! 
I think Basil just never really got a chance to grow. And yeah, having a chance at forgiveness is so important… Thanks for believing in the characters!  
the fucking arm twist there makes me violently uncomfortable 
is bro ok
He’ll be fine.
This is probably the most disturbing panel in the entire manga so far. Can’t wait for Black Space to see what they do to Basil there.
What if they would show what happened under the tunnel in Basil's Raft Path 
Is his arm on backwards?
humans are actually surprisingly flexible and this pose is possible, it's just very very uncomfortable. i would know :)
Oh, that’s interesting. It still looks so, so uncanny though…
no it fucking isn't
yes it is, you just have a skill issue . . on a serious note, it just comes down to flexibility and what you can do with your body. i've done this pose plenty of times by accident
.... . Judging from *his* pose, his hand is positioned in a way that his thumb is downwards. Then, in utter ignorance of what a joint is, it turns ***90°*** *outwards.* I can somewhat wring my arm in that direction with it up, but with the former (downwards thumb), you are **not** doing that.
...your thumb... does point down when you do this pose tho... 
Then you break your damn arm, no other question about it.. . So, I meant that if you turn the hand clockwise or something, but what's the use of waffling on?
damn poor boy...
What in the fucking Junji Ito is that ?
This is when you visit him in his house?
Jesus fucking christ 
Sweet Jesus. My poor boy
A wild bagel
There are a lot of things you can do with Basil.. . Sunny says: forgive Basil for his past mistakes. While it might be harsh, revenge and grudge will solve nothing, and we must move on from the past. It took me four years to understand that. In other words, give him one of your cookies.. . Omori says: hang the bastard.
I second what Omori says
No the fuck I dont
Then what would you do?
I would make sure he stays silent for the rest of his life
So myurder? ~~On the Owl Express?!~~
Yes
This comment section is split harder then Headspace Basil on the day the DREAMER became nothing.
>!Spoilers bruh D:!<
DO NOT LISTEN TO THE SINFUL COMMENTS . . YOU WILL TREAT BASIL AS A HUMAN . . HE HAS RIGHTS
My name is saul goodman. Did you know you have rights? Well, the constitution says you do!
Do not make Fangamer's mistake they made when advertising Spamton plush. That thing went unhinged. And even though Basil is definitely much more timid than Spamton, I wouldn't do that
thank you omg! this skirt is actually a few sizes too big for me and i had to pin it back  but it looked good so i had to wear it in the name of cosplay!!!!. . basil  birthday  yippeeee
oh yea i can feel the annoyance having to adjust it... i'm a guy who also wears skirts (yes we exist) and it's a living hell to find good ones that fit me, since i don't have a fem body time😫
happy late birthday for my boy basil!. . i must say, why dont you microwave him?
eat a bagel and a watermelon in front of him
Anyway basil mentioned
Eat basil.
*Processing img w4y7gstqoiye1...*. . Make a friend wear a Basil cosplay and remake this image
Basil trembling with his garden shears now 
BASIL! DO NOT DENY ME MY FLOWER CROWN!
ONE picture with it, that’s it!
It's awesome sauce to see a fellow Bagel cosplayer!!
Anyone who says it's photoshopped clearly just hating on basils skill

The previous times I'd often see Aubrey cosplayers or Sunny's that had a Something balloon attached to their back. There was also a Basil cosplay that had the Basil something around their waist as well one time.
Previous editions I did see basil and Aubrey a lot. Also sweetheart and spaceboy one time
You are amazing
Aww thanks
amazing cosplay I love how u did multiple poses + background effects, it adds a nice touch :o
Thank you :3 I wanted to show differend feelings with every picture
i first was like that is a verry feminine Basil and than i noticed that you where a girl XD . . but the cosplay looks verry good love the way you dit it.
Thank you :3 . Yes... even with binder and everything It's not that essy to hide that I'm feminine
the same is for a man I need to do a lot to look less masculine and more feminine. . . but still it looks really good :D teak the follow.
Aww thanks ;3
no need if i find someone who dus something good than they get a follow and you deserve it :D
You look like some badass dark wizard with that book
Magic photo book ! :3 i like it
Something about this cosplay makes Basil look like an intimidating villain and I totally dig it.
Is it the way I'm holding the photo? Like I'm ready to duell?
I think yeah, bout to pull some magic or somethin
You look so canon I love you
Also the pictures are way too good?!
Aww thank you very much <3
COME TO ME BASIL, I HAVE BEEN WAITING AN ETERNITY TO HAVE YOU IN MY ARMS 😭
Basil's so feminine only a girl can cosplay him right lol. . Great cosplay! 👍
While shooting someone asked us what we were doing and they actually thought that i am a 15 year old boy 😂 . Thank you
Wow..
this is great!
How did you make the Something? Cool cosplay as well.
Thank you . I drew it in with photoshop with a reference from the game
Oh cool, I thought it was a felt backdrop or something.
I LOVE IT

Now kys for the cosplay ofc

LMAOOO
I have the same issue with my eyes though 
Nice bagel cosplay!!
Thank you!! 
I genuinely can't tell if you're a girl or a boy. You've given me flashbacks to my first playthrough.

...I am so sorry
LOLL ur okay!! 
Cute
“Snuy And Bagel” 🤣🤣🤣

. . What the Geeblebob lol
Think this is the best wig for Basil i've seen thus far, his hair is really hard to nail in real life but you got it pretty well!  . . . Also glad your happy with yourself!
Wow, best? Heheh, thank you so much \~! I am indeed quite happy with how it turned out\~!
Title is literally what the first human to acknowledge existence and cosplaying could've said.. . Also, nice cosplay! Nice to see more cosplayers when i cannot because INSECURITY :)
Aww, sorry that you as well suffer insecurity! Maybe you can’t now, but someday you’ll be able to\~!. . (source: earlier this year I thought I would never be able to, but a certain friend helped me out \~!)
Nice costume
Thank you so much \~! I’m actually very self-conscious, so I originally wasn’t going to post any of these, but my friend encouraged me, so I decided to do so!
Nice cosplay glad to see niko as well in ur plush collection
Yep, Niko is there, too~! I have MANY other plushies, but they’re hiding in various places, and some are stored behind my bed. Lots of Kirbies and various Pokémon!
Lovely to hear wonderful cosplay op!!
Thank you \~!
Basil will become real in 5 seconds. . Good cosplay. I wanted to go as Sunny but my goofy ass forgot last minute 
Aww, it happens! Sorry you forgot!
nice :D 🌻
Thank you 🌻🌻\~!
YIPPEE YOU LOOK SO COOL  . it looks like you are strangling basil plush BUT OITHER THANB THAT VERY CUTE VERY NICE
IT’S A HUG!!! I SWEAR I’M NOT TRYING TO STEAL HIS LIFE SO I CAN BECOME BASIL FOR REAL!!!. . :3. . Thank you so much \~!
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!!!. . Hopefully no decapitations ensue …
op:. . 
Basil's in need of therapy.
Yep, he definitely is, and I could probably use it too, but alas I have paranoia and social anxiety and am not sure if I could open up to a therapist …
We've been there u\u
Yep. It is how it is …I have been getting a bit better though, thanks to my friend \~! Always remember to lean on your friends a bit in times of need\~! That’s what friends are for \~!
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,828,972,853 comments, and only 345,802 of them were in alphabetical order.
Wow, cool cosplay! Looks good  Happy Halloween!
Thank you \~!
Brasil! :D
Brasil \~! Bagel \~! Babil \~!
this is actually very wholesome :)
Thank you \~!
 Cosplay is so fun! I’m glad it’s brought you joy! Love the little basil plushie!
It is! I’m happy I managed to get myself to do it instead of being afraid and trying to never show my face anywhere to anyone, lol …
That’s great to hear you pushed yourself to do it! Never be afraid there will always be people who will put you down but don’t mind them they’re plenty of people who love to see and support you !
Aww, thank you for the words of encouragement \~! You’re so sweet!
Heheh, I try to smile when I can. Usually I only really can when chatting with my friend. Because she’s literally the best \~!. . But yeah, I have been smiling more this year! I’m not great at smiling, but I’ve been getting better :3
omori real
Luckily I don’t have any friends with big sisters and >!stairs!<, so hopefully I won’t have to >!get creative with a jump rope!< !
Y’know what… my friend’s korean… have a big sister… i’m blonde… and gay… . Conclusion : I’m fucked.
Uh-oh …So uh…hopefully your friend isn’t fighting with their sister anytime soon!. . And if they do…well, good luck, and >!remember that maaaaaybe the jump rope is the wrong answer…!!<
If they’re fighting at the top of the stairs then I know What to do.

No ! I mean… stop them !
you're real . . awesome cosplay btw you look great 
Thank you \~! Yes, I am in fact real!
basl 😱
Bagel \~!
basler😱
Baslest \~!
baslastilarrio (what is this)
Baslestereresterestesterest \~!. . (i don’t even know any more :3)
IM ONLY NOW COMING BACK TO THIS . . BAG 😟
That's awesome!! Great cosplay! 
Thank you \~!
Aww, thank you so much \~! Truth is that’s actually one of my sketchbooks for drawing that I’m holding, as I don’t have any photo albums. But it’s close enough, as my drawings are important to me, just like the photos are to Basil \~!. . And thanks for the praise to my room\~! There are actually more plushies hiding that can’t be seen in the picture :3
Yeah, photo albums are a thing of the past. A relic of a bygone age. As time moves forward, the world changes around us, even if we ourselves are stagnating. One day, we must step forward and grasp our future\~!. . Some of the plushies are so camera shy they hide under my bed (like I would sometimes if I could fit there ). Maybe I should gather them all for a MEGA group shoot, though \~!
Yeah, there was something special about such physical memories! I never really appreciated them back in the day, so I never really made such physical memories (not like I have too much in my early life worth remembering).  Maybe I can try to do something like that at some point, though, when I do start creating happy memories~!
It was a happy memory \~! And even if I don’t have any people I can hang out with irl, I have nice friends like you that I can talk with thanks to the marvels of modern technology \~! So those memories are happy \~!
That it does! I never would have met you or Skye or Anti if it weren’t for Reddit, and Reddit and Discord allow us to speak and be friends even with such distance!
I'm happy that you were happy babil !
Thank you \~! I was happy to be happy for a day \~!
Cute!   . Nice cosplay! 
Thank you so much \~! I’m happy so many people think so!
It ain't bad.
I was like huh, that's a good cosplay, looking through the pictures, then I recognized the artstyle in the background and knew it was you; great job getting out there! The hair is actually really good ngl
Oh wow, haha, someone who recognizes my artstyle even from the small pictures in the background! Wow, I never thought my style would be recognized like that! Thank you so much \~! Hearing that my art was recognized just made my day \~!
Good cosplay… it's Just… the… 
happy Halloween and sick cosplay mate. . 
Aww so cute :D
Thank you \~!
omg youre literally so adorable what the helllll 
Aww, thank you \~!
I also have that sketchbook 😆. . Such an awesome cosplay!
Yay, sketchbook pals \~! This is actually my previous sketchbook because I didn’t want to disrupt my drawing-in-progress in the current one, but the one I have now is the same, lol.. . Thank you \~!
Basil, more like bagel (no offence nice costume)
None taken, thanks~!
Nice! Once, I dressed up as Basil at a convention or something, and I ran into another Basil. They complimented my outfit and gave us free pizza. I cannot make this up.
Dang, I gotta try this at a convention then! I want free pizza \~!. . Although maybe I should lay off the pizza a little …
Nice cosplay dude! 
Thanks so much \~!
HELL YEAH BAGEL 
Thank you \~!
Thank you \~!
First good post on this subreddit in months lmao. You're a very pretty basil :) i love your cosplay
Aww, thank you so much \~!
No problem you're actually so cute <3

Thank you so much \~!
You’re adorable 💕
Thanks \~!
good cosplay. . 
WOW solid 10/10 naruto cosplay
It’s alright, but still came out and showed us, and that’s already better then me
I do have A flower, it’s just a black one because Halloween, so spoopy. Sometimes I wish I could have the apparent parentlessness, but I think everyone, adult or kid, feels that way sometimes …I see my mom getting frustrated when calling her dad and I think “I guess everyone is that way…”.
Me and my basil real?!1
W mans 🫡
How squiggly type
best cosplay ever
nice cosplay, looks like middle aged basil lol
💀💀💀💀💀
let people enjoy stuff it’s not that hard
DAD?!?

my exact thoughts. but lets realize this is a real human being, with thoughts and emotions and be proud of them for deciding to dress up. something im sure we're both too insecure to do :)
Damn basil really let himself go ever since mari died
Kinda rude 
ypu look like damnien from mean girls ( nice costume ! )
Ima just stfu
IS FAKE BASIL
Omg Basil, why do you look like Daz?
it's brasil
Do u need skill to cut and crimp it or was it pretty straightforward? Also  I love it this is the best basil cosplay I ever seen
styling the wig can be a liiiitle difficult at first but there are a lot of grate tutorials !! however crimping and cutting don't take lots of skill :) just make sure to test the heat setting on a part of the wig that isnt visible ^.^
Thank u very much!! Love the cosplay!!!
thank you !! and you're welcome !!
amazing cosplay, you're literally bagel i mean watermelon i mean babel i mean-
ah yes. . basil
Basil my darling
Also i  dont think its canon but i like to believe Basil's actual name is Rowan (his concept art name) and he got the nickname becouse his first plant was a basil Polly got from Othermart and he was obsessed with it everyone called him Basil boy and it stuck
KINGDOM HEARTS MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. . . (tbh I see Basil's hair as more similar to Sora's)
Idk, i think uhhhhhh, basil? Maybe?
yes correct it's headspace basil specifically 😍!
Awwww you look so awesome 
Honestly the best Basil cosplay I have seen so far! So lovely!!!
Me and my partner saw you at the convention! I was too shy to say anything, but your cosplay was my favourite! :D
Omg!! I'l be Basil again today, if you feel like it you are always welcome to come up and say hi. I will literally only be happy 
We only got Saturday tickets unfortunately! Three days of convention is a little much for me. :P We went as Emilico and Kate from Shadows House, if that rings a bell, but we didn't join the catwalk or anything. Maybe next time! :3
Oh yeah! I think I noticed you guys. You looked really neat  Also smart decision to only go that day. My friends and I went the whole weekend, and we are worth NOTHING now 😅
you look great!!
pretty 
Handmade with that much detail? This is cool as hell. . Of also mandatory costplay roast, you look like your name is carl
Thank you so much . . Carl 💀💀💀
It looks amazing. Great job 👏 . But I think I know something that would make it better, and all you need to do is......... . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Get in the elevator.

No the only thing that makes it better is a watermelon
U LOOK SO GOOD WHAT
Woow so cute
yoo you look so cool 
That’s such a great cosplay!! You look amazing! Gonna cosplay Basil myself in a week, but I doubt I’ll look as good as this haha 
So beautiful
Babil:)
The only thing to make this perfect is another photo with a melon replacing zeitaku

Super cute and accurate. Nice job 👍
Thank you :D
You're welcome 😁
This is how OMORI is gonna look on 2016!1!1!1!!1. . Epic cosplay, really puts the A in Basil.. as in, you know, A rank? 
You look adorable and I love the flower crown

Awesome!! :3
Awww, you look so cute, I love your cosplay! 
the bags are spot on
Thank you
I love the flower crown!

I will ones again dig my own grave and say fuck basil that oily haired no bitches mf
I'll have my ones again! 
Every Basil cosplay I see just cranks up the feminity to the max and completely ignores the true nature of his character. Basil is a teenage boy on the verge of suicide lol.
I can't help that I'm feminine 😭. . Do my eye bags help any?
True af. . I cried on my first playthrough, so in honor of the bagel, I play dress up 
YOOOOO
You da babil 
That isn’t Basil that is Ballistic  missile. Seriously, what is that
My sad attempt at cosplay 🤷🏼
I love the accepting attitude towards Ballistic Missile
Thank you

Holy hell! I thought the first picture is you holding a sniper while cosplaying as Basil

I'm just saying are you ok? Your legs are injured
I'm sure he's gonna make it
IM GOOD!!! just cuts and scrapes because back when these were taken i would spend all day prepping my garden GIGGLES
Is that an original One Step Polaroid
YEAH !!! its like my favourite thing ever we found it at a thrift store and i was all giddy about it
Good find 
amazing 🔥
THANK YOU !!
I would..def kiss him.. i always wanted to kiss a basil..!
WOAH
What?! Its the truth, i never kissed a boy..!
But like, that’s a real person. . 
I know.
i am also 17 years of age nervous emoji
I was kinda joking im one year less-. . I DIDBT REALLY MEAN IT 😭😭
GIGGLE
I mean.... /j
Alright freakatron
gah i cant you're actually so cute ;-;
Why is this so cute...
Great cosplay!!
THANK YOU !!
this is sooo good! ❤️‍🩹
We all know what you did, confess
Nice, although it looks freezing in these pics, how cold was it?
I am OBSESSED, I love it so much!!! 😭😭🌷
i wish basil was real
true .. sighs
I wish Basil was real so I could hug him.  He needs one.
i would do that too because i need one too haha
Yeah, then I won’t have to worry about getting a girlfriend
Basil aint real but femboys and twinks are. Just swing both ways
Ik, I turned into a pendulum like a year ago
Yknow what could really flesh out the style (omori’s time frame with basils pictures) the app west, it copies an old cameras style perfectly
Awww that's super cute >,<  . Basil is such a sweetie
They look like if basil was real i was about to have my most happy crashout until i saw "cosplay" 😭😭😭💔💔💔
You just took photos of basil.
Basil, what are you doing? Get in the robot!. . 

omori jacked as fucj
I fucking love this community
I fucking love air conditioner
Omori looking like a brick wall
Omori being a hikkikomori at the gym and not at the whitespace.
Omori is locked omg. . 
That's in Omori 2
Sniper from. Omori Fortress 2?

Yall better hide from fucking omori
he's got muscles, a knife, and no more fucks to give
Atleast youre having fun thats what matters most
The least buffed omori fan
"When I flex, I feel my best!" Ahh OMORI
Omori flexed
That Omori is so stupid looking. Oh my gosh. Wowie. Why is he standing like that? Such a silly goose. Fucking dumbass.
kinda rude for the dude... he was chill, just a buff guy.
Ah, what? K.. I don't know, bro? Didn't even say anything bad.
Holy shit the hair and the fit wow when i saw this i was like “holy moly” ITS BASIL
Bahaha thank you so much!! :'3
finally a basil cosplay that doesnt use that really fake looking wig. . now you just need a flower pin
Hahaha, that'd really complete the picture! . Since it's just my real hair and an actual outfit moreso than a cosplay I never really know what to call it, but it's fun to get inspired by characters you like!! 🥺
whatever you do i just hope youve had a happier and less traumatic life than the canon bagel 
HAHAHA Thank you kindly 
wait, now that i think about it, a fake-looking basil wig would actually be pretty close to what **the maverick** wears 
wait you have a point…
cant expect people do dye their hair thats a hassle. and most people got dark hair, blondes are an endangered species.
Definitely! No hard feelings at all to anyone who uses wigs like that! 
What do you mean you got a Basil inspired haircut? All I see are pictures of a hyper realistic Basil with brown hair...
Bahaha! Does it look brown? I always called it dark blonde but I'm no expert :'3
I just see it as blonde
It looks a bit brown in the image, but I can see some blonde in there!
I'm not jealous at all. . 
THIS IMAGE LMAOOOO 😭
Hai... 🌻✨
that looks so amazing like youre actually basil lmao. . how long did it take for the hair to get to that specific style/*how* was it able to get to that specific style?
I got a haircut earlier in the day with messy layers for the most part, cut using a hairstyling knife/razor thingy instead of scissors! That way it's all more messy and uneven! I kept the front/strands in front of my ears longer, hence the bangs! My usual haircut is also layered, but a bit longer & without the bangs. (Photo is an older one but hopefully shows what I mean!). . . Then once home I showered, dried it a little by ruffling it with a towel and let it dry naturally after, and then used some hairspray (not too much!) to keep it from slowly 'deflating'. . I hope that answers your question! . . 
ooh, okay, seems like that took a bit to do but it went well all in the end cause you have basils haircut now . . congrats, you are now basil . . >!do you have a friend that plays the violin perhaps?!<
RemindMe! 7 day
that's so cool!! you rock that and the outfit so well!!
AAA Thank you so much!! 🥺
Lol you could also do a pretty good link cosplay

Oh my god!! It’s real life Basil! Funny enough, if I cut my hair short again then I’ll look 100% like Sunny
Omg hell yeah!! That's super cool! 
omg you're bagel fr fr fr 
a true basil cosplay and its very good
bro i think you ARE basil
I almost replied 'Haha I wish!' dlkfjdlk  
Heres hoping your friend doesn't have a sister who plays piano!
Basil, you’re not slick. That is all I’ll say.

Your hair is mine now, sorry   . \[seriously though, wow\[
It's gonna take a lot of work to have your hair stay like that that's for sure.
This picture was after a shower! Just naturally dried and a tiny bit of hairspray, so it's not so bad! :3
Bagel
Did you get your haircut using garden clippers by chance? of so, that would be pretty ironic.
Basil is at it again, scribbling over pictures, that creep! /j. . Great cosplay!
THATS SO CUTE !!!
THANK YOUUU!! 🩵
AWESOME!!!!!!!!
Thank you!! 🥹
Gorgeous, love it
Thank you!! 💚
Hey, we have the same hairstyle lol. . Awesome outfit by the way 
Awesome!! And TYSM!! 
Yo, that's awesome.
Thank you!! 
Dang so beautiful. Totally get a wonderful flower crown and you've got the whole shebang. Love it and you pull that so much better than I ever could.
HOLY SHIT THAT’S WONDERFUL
Not gonna lie, it's nice!
you listen to will wood dont you?
THIS COMMENT HAS ME CACKLING. . The answer is yes, sometimes LOL 
That's amazing omg, it's like a cosplay but more subtle 
Exactly!! It's genuinenly so fun to take clothing/outfit inspiration from fiction like this!
I really do want to try it, but the cost of clothes kinda scares me😅.. did you have to buy extra stuff or did you just use what you had lying around?
The only thing I had to get extra was the green sweater vest, since I didn't own any yet! Now I own a few different ones haha! 
Omg I might try it then
I know I'm a day late, BUT YOU LOOK SO CUTE!
Aaaa thank you very much!! 🥹
Cap. You can't have a Basil inspired outfit if you yourself are Basil
Haha! Thank you so much! 
AHHH MY GOSH
Nice, outfit! I have that same camera, but blue, not black on the bottom.
Awesome!! I've been using mine for a personal journal for a while now, absolutely love polaroids!
This is sooooo good, amazing
Every single part of this image is just canon basil
LOL Thank you!! Now I feel like I should've included my photo journal and collection of plants for extra effect bahaha 
While I’ve enjoyed seeing the various Omori-inspired outfits here, they admittedly tend to look forced or something people would only wear at a Comic-con or other event. But this looks so natural!! 10/10 
Thank you so much!! 
It looks good.
Silly goose  
OH MAH GLOB IT'S BLEHSIL!!. . You look good in it tbh.
Holy shit it's basil Omori from the famous hit indie game Omori
Pretty cute
Omg two people with the same pfp-. . "I've found you, faker!". . "Faker? I think you're the fake Basil around here!"
There can only be one

great cosplay!! these pictures look great 
Perfect bagel cosplay 
Happy cake day

OOH IT’S SO GOOD ! I love it !
I agree. . 
Opinion: you look outstanding!!! The hair in particular, I don’t think I’ve seen a Basil cosplay with hair that good before! And, of course, everything else is wonderful as well!
Thank you! The hair also looks great behind but I couldn't make such a photo myself and I had nobody to ask for. I wish I could show it to you. I'll try to make more photos when I'll get a new vest.
You could make a video of yourself doing a spin, then screenshot it to get the hair from the back
It looks nice. I like it
. . Couldn’t find a good reaction image for this post BUT i think u look very cute in that cozplay, good job!

I quite like it. Dare I say I enjoy it!

Cute, let's hope this one doesn't get sent to blackspace.

Basil was bitten by a radioactive camera and now has photographic memory.
He also gained the ability to make deathcards

Breaking the watermelon was a canon event
Daayum! Basil got dem jays! Both dapper and drippy, I love the work put into the cosplay! 
I love the little sprout clipped on top of your head!
Where was this
Omg basil 
Great job on the cosplay

CANON EVENT
Why do I actually see Basil beating the sh*t out of people with his photo album
Lmaoo🤣🤣🤣
My freaking god basil is cursed
???
Looks good ngl, but I feel like with those hair Basil would have worked better
Probably, I just said that if they had the chance Basil would have fit better with the hairstyle
Imagine is someone dressed as Basil there 
no just don't ever think of that 
sorry bro but you look like basil with the sunny adjacent fit (they wear basically the same thing except basil's vest is green)
Wow Basil really got a growth spurt 
Reall
Le plant le grow 
You being a tall guy and cosplaying basil is cursed, I love it
Double bagel
You have such a nice smile! Very Basil like!
Thank you so much. It's actually something I'm pretty self-conscious about.
Your basil cosplay is so cute! Great job!
I have a BASIL cosplay but the shirt for it is dirty
By any chance, are any of those plants basil?
Basil is all plants... Every plant has Basil in it, and it is watching you. Basil is everywhere, you can't get away from Basil
That’s for the basil cosplay smh my head
Ok

THANK YOU !!! i was waiting for somebody to notice the cutout LOL im making basils something next !!!
\^^
BAGEL
Erm I think there's SOMETHING behind you Basil...
I'm more of a Basil, Kel is awesome but I'm basically Basil
Without the rope and sheers of course!
I just realized I was born on the same day as Basil. Jealous?. . 
I was born on the same day as the chernobyl incident
dude same
Damm
well, on the same day, years later
What's chernobyl
Soviet nuclear reactor went boom
The deadliest nuclear disaster in history
hell yeah...?
I get so happy whenever I see another 06 lol
I don't see that often either!
Me and Elvis share the same birthday
I was born the same day as Jack black
I was born on the same day and month as Stalin's death.. . Not year tho, Cannot imagine a 72 year old in this sub lol
British Basil. . Brasil
BRASIL MENCIONOU?????🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
British Basil is this guy . . 
4) His name is "Basil"
He's either british or irish, but more importantly, he either has to be an eastern slav, or part greek, because I don't know if st. basil is canonised within roman catholicism or not
Roman Catholic here, he is!
He's definitely irish then, is blond hair that common amongst mediterraneans?
I don't think it is. I don't live anywhere near the Mediterranean though, it's just that the main version(?) of Catholicism is called Roman Catholicism.
Basil is actually the flower on his head, and the rest is a vessel from which he performs human cultures like a human gardener would grow different plants. . . "Basil" is Greek or Slavic. "Bagel" is Jewish. "Babel" is Assyrian. "Brazil" is Brazilian. "Babe" was French but the other alien plants hate French colonialism and made him Malagasy. "Barley" is closer to his true form
I want pink basil flowers. Mine are always white
New theory: Basils parents were deported to [NORTH EUROPEAN COUNTRY] but he got to stay since he was born here. They are wealthy enough to let him stay and for some reason, they really insist on this arrangement.
In a fic I'm actually wrigting RIGHT NOW, I made Basil British, Living in England where his parents lived... and killed off both his parents so... now I just have to use the word bulbous a lot and I'll comply with these
A french here I'm sure Basil is too gentle to be french 😔🙌
Went to Paris once because my mum is delusional and was scared for whatever money was on me the entire time
I assure you that in Paris, especially on the metro pickpocketing is really common
Il est du Sud.
It's quite rare to have blond hair, blue eyes and a very light skin in the south of France, people are much more tanned because of the sun
Rare, but possible. I'll take those odds any day of the week.
I know a lot of kind people exactly like Basil who are living in the south.
That's quite a neat headcanon, british basil seems cute
I mean basil isn’t a super uncommon name here, I know a couple old British guys with that name. (It’s pronounced ba - zil from the people I know)
Idk why but I thought at the top it said basil is a bitch, idk why ?
He would lose the nerve if he didn't. It was then or never. He would move away, months would pass, and by then it would be too late to gather the courage again, with each passing day making it harder and harder. He'd probably just kill himself like Basil tried.
I disagree. I think Basil is relieved by it. I mean the only reason Basil is in such a bad state is both the hiding of the truth as well as Sunny abandoning him. Thats why at the end, Basil smiles and loses his something when he sees Sunny lose his, and to me that implies he knows the truth is out and is happy
Fair enough.
True, but last time he did try to talk to him Basil stabbed him in the eye. He only has one left, couldn’t take that risk.
I always assumed right before the truth sequence, where basil talks to you outside the house was real world basil talking to sunny while he was unconscious.I think he wanted everyone to know the truth but he doesnt feel like it should be him to say it. I think he knows they would he mad at him for also covering it up but would feel more relieved knowing that his best friend no longer has the guilt of covering it up and would be happy knowing that they can both move on and be able to grieve properly and not live in perpetual fear of people finding out the truth for themselves.. . Edit: slight word changes
Sadly that's only the 50% of the problem solved, they'd finally forgave themselvs, but now how would react the others? The least I would expect is never talking to greenboy again in a long time
Oops was supposed to comment this under OPs comment to yours my bad
Do you not think Basil would forgive him immediately. I feel like its cannon
This is a good question but i do genuinely think they forgive each other wholely. I think the main thing is neither of them forgiving themselves. All Basil does is help Sunny in almost anyway he can, i think the only thing Basil might not forgive him on is leaving him alone after saying theyd face it together but then again Basil also stabs Sunny in the eye so i think both realize they fucked up and forgive. Basil isnt one to have gredges and neither is Sunny really
Tbf Basil was also basically out of it too just acting on instinct. Hes pretty traumatized too
No, I mean he was not conscious lmao. He was in a dark disbelieving nightmare the entire time they were hanging Mari, he did not accept Basil's plan, or go along with it, he reacted to stimulus while Basil pushed him around. The photo descriptions explain this better.
They were cut because they didn't fit the scene, to have blocks of text next to the photos, not because they were meant to be disregarded. They would be deleted if that were the case, as they are simply blocks of text. Toby Fox does something similar, hiding lore in the code.. . And Sunny pushing Mari had nothing to do with Basil?? He was just there, Sunny didn't tell him "come here Basil, planning to kill my sister after lunch and make you witness it" or anything, why would this be a grudge point? If Sunny had agreed to Basil's plan sure, I can see how he could feel resentful for going along with his panic induced scrambling, but literally because he happened to see something? Basil also clearly shows it ingame, they both feel guilty, because they both played their clear roles. Sunny killed Mari, Basil dragged them both into hanging her and making the others believe a lie. . . Of course, unless your point is that Basil would be irrationally spiteful, distorting the truth of his own memories, like Sunny did, and put all the blame of the hanging on him. I can kind of see that, but Basil does not display any signs of having the wrong memories, he's tormented because he clearly remembers.. . I think Basil probably blames himself more for the damage his plan did, as even in his madness during his fight he is still trying to "help" Sunny in his own way, striking at what he sees as Something. The only thing Basil ever blames Sunny for is trying to leave him, never the incident. And even then, he blames but does not resent, he just feels really lonely and desperate.
Wait... you will? Did, did I just convince someone on the Internet?. . This... this isn't how it's supposed to go! The script is all wrong! Where are the insults, the defensiveness? The backtracking and regurgitating of previously mentioned points? The attack on my person? You just accept the logic and internalize the new viewpoint?. . Wow... well then, nice discussing with you, a pleasant debate! Have a nice day fellow OMORI fan ^ ^
basil deserved it
Basil seems like the type of person who would make it seem as if he forgave him but still constantly have it on the back of his mind, especially because took part in it
i think basil and kel should change places. kel is a kind of person who can't have resent towards anyone, and basil would be frustrated after sunny tells the truth, breaks the promise and betrays basil by doing that
It was already out for Basil but yeah i get what you mean now
BASIL WAS WITH HIM WHEN THEY DIDt5\31hpy:2478
Aubrey didn’t kill Basil and frame it as a suicide. Nor was Hero in a loving relationship with Basil.
But he could’ve died. And I’m sure Hero cared about Basil anyway.
The photos are like facebook photo posts where they only show the good times and make everything seem perfect. Basil only wanted to keep the good memories and it also doesn't make much sense to be like "oo they're fighting again let me flash them with my camera".
İn memories they fight like always(basils birthday,beach,rain)in photos of course they are not bickering,i dont think basil would want them bickering in the photo album. . Also,hero tells us this happend a lot in RW
Basil did a lot more than just provoke I suppose.
I just realized that the eye that’s not shown is the same as the one he later loses while fighting Basil
I feel like he'd call ice on basil 
Sunny, just after pushing Mari: “B-Basil, why…? . . Basil, suggesting they should hang her: “Wynaut?”. . *Seinfeld theme plays*
holy shit it’s the chicanerous basil

Basil is also wearing some overalls, doesn't look very comfy for a sleepover tbh 
I think this is the booklet that comes with the physical game, at least mine came with it. You also get a cute omor + basil sticker, definitely recommend lol
Yep that's it! I actually saw it like almost a week, when I first opened it (I had the digital copy but wanted a physical one for bsckup) and it was a very happy surprise lol... the sticker adorable and the booklet is pretty useful
Omor is everywhere.
why would basil even think about photo'ing this
if i was him im gonna throw it in the trash
Just turn her into basil
But like, sunny literally fist fought basil so hard he sent him to the hospital, and woke up before basil despite having been stabbed in the eye. Plus he can like heal wounds by breathing lmao
I can heal wounds by breathing too, it just takes a while
And yet he showed to be stronger than Basil.
There are multiple factors to when someone wakes its not all based on strength
I imagine having your eye stabbed with garden shears doesn't affect positively your chances of waking up soon after a fight.
I would assume no, but that doesn't prove he's stronger
The fact he fought Basil armed with garden sheers and managed to wake up sooner means explicitly he is stronger than him. It means he came on top even with deck being stacked against him. Game disagrees with you lmao.
You can't say with certainty that he woke up sooner. Maybe he had already woken up and just went back to sleep because he was too tired, you can't measure the strength of characters by who woke up first, you don't even know exactly how the fight went
I know everyone is saying that basil is gay, and yk that's fair he gives those vibes, but I would like to present an alternative, he also seems like he might be aromantic. . He loves his friends, doesn't need romance
he likes spiders and watermelon
I always HC'ed basil as aroace
I've got a Basil headcannon that the reason he suggested that he and Sunny covered up Mari's death as a suicide even though he's a 12-year-old is because he had a very unstable home life and thus has considered it himself, and that resulted in him coming up with that idea.. . The reason I figured this is because it's highly implied Basil's parents either died or abandoned him when he was young, as there's a picture frame you can interact with in his house that says something about Basil and his parents and how Sunny, Basil's bestie had never seen them, even though they had known each other since they were roughly 6-7 ish? I'm not 100% but they look about that age from the final duet cutscene seen near the end of the game. Also, his caretaker Polly doesn't recognize Sunny iirc, implying that's not the first one he's had.. . Many people would say a 12-year-old having suicidal thoughts isn't possible but it's deffo possible since a 7-year-old can and I'm totally not talking from experience :)
Hahaha, I DID THAT
Basil changes his name to Babil for literally no reason after the good ending
Basil is crushing a bit on Sunny that's why him shutting himself in for 4 years is especially soul crushing for Basil.. . I know it's not very original but I just have a thing for cute gay love stories 👉👈
Aight Imma start a war…. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Basil is gay (generous and yolo)
no hes pan😡
Retar fail moment
you sir are not gay
Shush
Everyone except Basil is Bi. And of course Basil is gay
Basil becomes tall because he eats only healthy food, It's not canon since he's depression skinny but I like to think he's healthy.
Basil doesn’t like elevators (get it?)
basil has a fresh car smell candle
basil is actually a plant that somehow  gained sentience ,took human form ,and started raising a plant army to defeat humanity
Basil likes the care bears
*posts a picture of basil cannonball head*
A bunch of these are just theories that I believe in but eh.. . Mari was still alive after falling, Sunny killed her when he decided to hang her.. . Basil is a femboy. . If Orange Joe was in headspace it would make Kel nuke stronger. . Basil has his own headspace (a game from the pov of Basil could be a fun sister game). . Omori is extremely destructive and would kill everything in its path if freed (when I got to blackspace I realized why the Omori genocide au exists 💀)
Basil sounds like ash Ketchum if his balls dropped a whole 20%
I'll gift him therapy money  . He needs it
Thank you for the kind gift

Why do u exist
Why do I exist?
Why do we exist? And why do we bother doing mindless things? After all, we cease to exist in the end, so why bother? Dopamine. The code of happiness, it is the only reason we continue to thrive. The only reason why anything keeps going. But what if we could get that happiness now? What if we just pumped raw dopamine into our brains 24/7? Will we even bother to do anything after that? Or will we just sit there until we ro- bruh wtf did I just type.

Which route are you in
aww what a cute character! i hope nothing bad happens to him
i agree  
Too precious, must protecc, don’t let near blackspace, AVOID SOMETHING
Me when 
There is a whole essey in psychological literature to be written about the differences between the Headspace photo album and the IRL photo album. Maybe I'll do it at some point.
Id love to hear it, pls do
Seconded, would read!
Not if do it first!  
Then it's a competition
I always took it as he didn’t feel like he could keep making flower crowns if they kept wilting, so he decided on just the flower to keep the spirit of the idea.
I like the flower crown 
Basil's garland restores 1.33 sanity per minute, which isn't much, but it's a start.
I can just imagine the friend group trapped in The Constant
I found it interesting how “Everyone thinks a flower crown really suits me.” was cut and paste from the flower crown photo to the reading photo. Which seems random at first, but if we’re going by this theory it could be because Sunny is especially fond of it, and this is the only photo where he’s alone with Basil. Plus Omori shows the most emotion there than in any other photo.. . >!Extra detail: in RW Mari takes the photo while Basil isn’t paying attention. But in Headspace she makes Hero take the photo. This is because she isn’t allowed out of the picnic blanket (except for rare occasions).!<
i think basil is cute regardless 
exactly 
Yeah thats how I always viewed it honestly. Not to mention its suuuuper powerful as a charm in hikiko route

700 upvotes... thank you all 
Meanwhile Basil's dreams:. . 
  . . . :get blackspaced bi-  . . . :\*violin noises\*  . . . :\*dies\*

so thats why basil decided to fight sunny at the end
I don't know why people headcanon any of the characters the way they do. . . Hero, like you said, isn't the type to get furious. He is shown in headspace to represent the sad emotion (with Aubrey getting angry and Kel getting happy) so I don't think Hero would have it in him to start screaming at Sunny and Basil.. . I have no idea how people believe Aubrey is just going to forgive Sunny and Basil. "Oh but she threw Basil into the lake once!" is not enough to convince me she'd just accept an apology from these two for killing her role model and then covering it up by making it look like a suicide. Sunny and Basil tore Aubrey's whole support group apart and she was left to fend for herself. I don't think she'd ever forgive them, she'd just come to terms with what happened.. . And Kel wouldn't just accept what happened in a day either. He's optimistic and airheaded, but it isn't a clueless idiot. He watched his brother spiral into a depression after Mari's death. He watched his friend group split apart. And we're supposed to believe he would just be like "Aw, shucks, I forgive you two!" after finding out Sunny killed his sister and he & Basil hung her corpse up on a tree to convince everyone else she killed herself? That's bananas. I could see Kel keeping in touch with Sunny and Basil, but that's moreso because he knows the two need it and not because he forgives them. I believe the only way Kel will forgive the two for what happened is when he knows Hero forgave them.
You're assuming that Aubrey would be thinking 100% logically after hearing the truth. I'm not saying the lake scene isn't meant to parallel the events leading to Mari's death, it obviously is, but is Aubrey going to sit down and think "Gee, Sunny sure did kill my role model. And Basil sure did cover up her murder to look like a suicide. But I also pushed Basil into a lake, so I can understand Sunny and Basil's point of view."? Aubrey pushed Basil into the lake while there were multiple people around that could have helped him. Sunny pushed Mari down the stairs and unintentionally killed her and then he & Basil framed it as a suicide. Just because the scenes parallel each other doesn't mean it's the same situation. . . And I'm not saying that Aubrey will hate Sunny and Basil forever. I just don't think she'd ever forgive them. I could see her keeping in touch with the two and repairing their friendship, but things would never be the same and she would never be as close with them as she once was.. . If everyone forgives Sunny and Basil, the consequences of their actions don't stay, which they should. The point of the ending isn't that everyone forgives the two and they all live happily ever after, it's that Sunny and Basil forgive themselves and will begin to heal.
The point of the ending isn't *just* that Sunny and Basil forgive themselves. The entire buildup is the idea that eventually Sunny and Basil can, to some degree, restore their relationships even after the truth. Basil says as much at the start of Memory Lane, and Sunny's mental projection of his friends before the Omori fight do the same.. . The consequences of their actions do stay, even if they are forgiven - Mari is gone, and that open spot will always remain empty. Her absence is the consequence that they will have to learn to live with.. . Aubrey on her own might not think that, but you are taking these characters in isolated scenarios even though the point by the end is that, in Hero's own words: "Last time, we made the mistake of leaving each other when we needed each other the most. This time, we'll stay together." Hero was the one who mediated between Aubrey and Kel and helped them both see reason and forgive each other honestly. He would be the one to remind her about the panic and fear of losing everyone for good because her emotions got the better of her. . . > Aubrey pushed Basil into the lake while there were multiple people around that could have helped him. . The only person there who could have reasonably helped him was Kel. Sunny and Basil both would have drowned if Hero hadn't shown up in time, and it would have been Aubrey's fault. There were only 4 people at the lake when that happened - it's a hidden spot otherwise. The point is to show just how quickly your life can take a sharp turn with one emotionally driven action. Granted, I do think Aubrey would find it harder to forgive Basil given he was the one who had the idea of staging the scene. But again, the entire buildup has been to show that there is still hope that the friend group will recover.
THE BASIL PART?1!?1!1!1!1?t5\31hpy:21601


Nah Snuuy would snitch on Basil, if basil doesn’t fess up himself
kk
Basil’s literally on his death bed and everyone just starts slapping him 
Now let's just wait the moment when she discovers that also Basil made a Opsie Daisy . . 
She just left Basil’s house
I feel like Aubrey would be mad at basil, not sunny. >!Sunny made a terrible, terrible, mistake. But it was still a mistake. But basil? Basil knew what happened and chose to cover it up. He hid the truth from them leaving them to wonder why Mari left them, what they didn't see, and how they failed to save her for years. Hero on the other hand, got so mad he hurt his brother and can't even face mari's grave, he loved her, he wanted to marry her. And now he's learned that the person who killed her is standing in front of him? Hero would be mad. yeah basil lied to him, but sunny is who actually took her from him!<
>!Aubrey is pretty mad, but guilt she holds about Basil is kinda holding her from snapping at them!<
Fr basil (the character) made me gay*

Same actually
Basils something goes into his head instead of disappearing
well since it was already debunked by another person who commented this comment is useless  . but imma write anyways its just a concidence the design of a common light bulb and how it is used in cartoons to represent an idea   . it looks like a noose cuz that is the common design  . and omo cat chose the light bulb probably as it represents ideas in cartoon shows and its purpose was to represent the idea that basil had during the truth sequence
I love that both your ideas, though different, still address the bullying and it’s effects. I feel like the fact basil was relentless bullied for close to 4 years is something a lot of people forget or otherwise brush over. It’s kinda understandable when you consider how many other big traumatic events happen in the game, but I still think it’s a shame that it’s so often ignored
I can almost guarantee that basil blamed himself for the bullying, or at a minimum viewed the constant name calling, physical abuse, and being treated as an outcast as “appropriate punishment” for what he did. Even with his photo album, something that’s described as being his most precious belonging, assuming that Aubrey took it the same day she saw the scribbles on the pictures she would have had it for 4 years, and as far as we know, basil just accepted it being stolen for all that time. I don’t think it’s a coincidence he only tried to get it back 3 days before his suicide attempt. He probably wanted to see photos of everyone happy and together one last time before he died.
I don’t think we have actually seen the gang go out of there way to start conflicts. When we first see them bullying basil Kim is actively trying to go away. There subsequent encounters while they do start the fight they also are doing there own thing not messing with anyone. When they’re in there hide out spot its p explicit that there not trying to bully basil. The only person in the group who seems to have done any actual bullying is well, Aubs
I like Aubrey and the Hooligans. They are fun characters. However what we see is 3 days, which are clearly in some form of school holidays as nobody is in school, and for one of them basil spends most of the day in hospital (and sunny spends at least half of one of them in bed) These clearly aren’t reflective of what an average day looks like for these characters of the past 4 years.. . Even then what we see is:. . Kel repeatedly ask Aubrey to stop bullying basil during our few confrontations with her. . Kim punch or otherwise hit basil . . Basil has a panic attack when surrounded by them (so clearly just being in a situation like than alone with all of them was enough to cause him to have a breakdown). . Basil get shoved into a lake and almost drown.. . And that was **only 3 days**. . From with we can infer that basil is clearly scared of them and just being in a situation where he is alone and surrounded by all of them is enough to trigger a panic attack in him (I’m not sure what else you could call his reaction there.) . . We can also infer that they harass basil enough for Kel to call it bullying and repeatedly ask Aubrey to get them to cut it out. While Kel is Kel and his assessment is to be taken with a grain of salt, the game wouldn’t have brought it up multiple times for no reason. It clearly wants us to consider real world Aubrey and her friends as bullies.. . Also, even Aubrey admits that she was bullying basil. At the stump, after everyone (other than basil) has made up with Aubrey, she breaks down in tears and says that “what I have been doing to him (basil) is way worse” and that “soon I wasn’t the only one doing it”. If it was just two people who hated each other sometimes bumping into one another and having a bad interaction, or only Aubrey who was picking on basil, she would have no reason to say these things. If there was no bullying going on she would have no reason to feel guilty, and if it was only her she would have no reason to say “soon I wasn’t the only one doing it”.. . Yes the hooligans are a cool and wacky cast of characters and I love them for that. However they were also bullies. You can like the characters while acknowledging they may not have always been the nicest of people
Btw when the events are happening it is summer (evidenced by hero saying it himself plus hero showing up at all). . But something important to note is just how you interpret Basil. Because how you interpret basil kinda molds how you would interpret the hooligans. Most of the time its ether basil is a misunderstood kid who was broken by a bad day and it spirals. Or as a obsessive Psychopathic Sociopath. Personally I lie in the middle and I believe Basil is just kinda delusional and irrational but still sane. I do believe that the Hooligans dislike Basil and call him names. But i do not believe the gang is going after basil like a harasser would. And with the Aubs stuff. I mostly consider Aubs actions separate from the hooligans as a gang because the egregious stuff aubs did were her actions and hers alone
The interpretation of basil “as an obsessive psychopath” is just a downright incorrect one, and one I’ve only seen from people who irrationally hate him as a character.. . Basil has anxiety, I can tell you that with 99% certainty. As somebody who suffered from it for many years, many of basils behaviours are quite familiar to me. Excusing myself to the bathroom to allow a panic attack to run its course or having a panic attack because I was around people I knew bullied me and had none of my friends near by are all things I have experienced personally. Basils anxiety is incredibly well written and one of the reasons I love his character. While I don’t think the incident alone broke him (he clearly had some other underlying abandonment issues / a bit of a toxic dependency on sunny) he is far from some evil genius pulling the strings, and to say he is is just downright against the main messages of the game. He and sunny are supposed to shoulder the blame for what happened equally and are both equally tragic characters.. . As for separating Aubrey’s actions from the hooligans. You can’t, because they aren’t just Aubrey’s actions.. . **Kim literally punches basil.** Kim and Vance are both shop lifters and try to pick a fight with us for no reason. The Maverick picks a fight with us for no reason, so does angel. They all surround basil by the lake. And **Aubrey literally says that she was not the only one being mean to basil**. She has no reason to lie about this and throw her new friend group, who she is shown care deeply about, under the bus like this if it was only her picking in basil.
Okay but in defense of the shop lifting the candy lady is extremely annoying
>The interpretation of basil “as an obsessive psychopath” is just a downright incorrect one, and one I’ve only seen from people who irrationally hate him as a character.. . Also fanfic writers
I can’t currently find the quote but I believe Kim says she doesn’t know anything about the photo album when telling basil to talk to aubs herself. And with the surrounding thing. I do not think that was bullying. They weren’t being mean or anything in that situation and it was pretty explicit. Saying things like “we don’t want to hurt you we just want you to leave” and “cmon man don’t make a big deal out of this we just want you to go” which is pretty reasonable imo
Even if they don’t know about the photo album that doesn’t mean they weren’t bullying basil. You don’t need to know why bullying started to join in. Hell, most of the time there isn’t even a reason why bullying starts.. . As for the lake thing, the only thing they say to basil directly is “stop yelling your going to make a seen”. The “we weren’t going to hurt him we just wanted him out of here” thing is something they say to Kel. We have no reason to take them at face value there, which is something Kel points out.. . Also, I will once again point out that **we literally see Kim punch basil on screen**, so there is literally no argument that to say she wasn’t also bullying basil. Also the game and Aubrey literally state that Aubrey wasn’t the only one bullying him. You are literally arguing against something the game point blank states to us
I agree that taking there word is hard to do but we literally see there interactions before they notice Kelsey. And we see them not doing anything malicious to Basil in that situation. And with the Album the reason why them not knowing about the album wasn’t to argue that they aren’t bullying basil but it was to show that the Album thing was A aubs thing and not a hooligans thing. The argument im trying to make here is that the Hooligans aren’t trying to maliciously target babil and harass him like the original commenter said and not that they aren’t bullies.
They are though. Kim quite literally punches him hard enough to make him fall on the floor crying
Thats not harassing. Harassing would be if they are actively seeking basil out to harm and bully him. While the evidence we are shown in game is that they are mean to him when they run into one another
Aubrey is going around bullying him. Aubrey always hangs out with the hooligans. The hooligans are shown to physically and emotionally abuse basil. Aubrey says that she wasn’t the only one bullying basil. . . Therefore the logical conclusion is that the hooligans also bullied basil. I’m not sure why you are so opposed to this.
Im not opposed to them bullying basil im opposed to harassing him, they werent. Aubrey says things along the lines of “how could you show your face to me after what you did” which shows that she hates him so much she doesn’t even want to see him. I don’t believe aubs was going around bullying him. They very clearly are shown wanting to go do things instead of track down and bully basil. They’re grade A bullies but there not harassers
I don’t know what your definition of harassment is but the Oxford Dictionary describes it as this: Intimidation, bullying, threatening, or coercive behavior, including manner of speech, usually by a superior toward a subordinate, sometimes by colleagues in an organization.. . Seems a lot like what the hooligans were doing to basil
Ah, i see. I always thought harassment ment the purposeful unrelenting targeting of a individual. Sorry for the miss understanding
I wanna see their reaction to >!Basil committing suicide!< 
And after that I want to see them (except charlie) lynched by the townspeople >!/s!< >!?!<
They are definitely bullies. Their introduction has them bully Basil. I know it's because Basil is annoying them, but he's doing so because their leader stole from him an important memento, regardless of any personal reasons. . . That being said, not all bullies are created equal, so on a scale from worst to okayish:. . Aubrey, extremely violence prone, known to steal and has no problems threatening people with a lethal weapon (though does not seem to use it, atleast against people she once called friends). . Kimberly, extremely violence prone, known to be a petty bully and recurrent thief, may have been a large influence in pushing Aubrey towards her current lifestyle, judging by her dialogue.. . Mikhael, moderately violence prone, however more of a macho show off who has no problems going along with whatever their leader or group in general wants to do.. . Angel, highly violence prone, likes fighting in order to prove himself to the group and his 'master' 'The Maverick'. It is however of note that unlike others his violence is not malicious, and more competitive in nature. Despite this, he has no qualms about bullying Basil and engaging in hooliganry. He is also quite weak, and as such not as much of a 'threat' despite being a little more aggressive and gung ho. . . Vance, mildly violence prone, dislikes partaking in conflicts of any kind, but is known to regularly participate in thievery and being dragged into fights by his much more aggressive sibling Kim. Though makes attempts to dissuade her and reign in the worst of her impulses, he still caves in somewhat easily and participates in conflict with her. . . And finally, Charlene, practically non violent. Despises participating in conflicts of any kind, and is not known to participate in any criminal acts save for what is forcefully dragged into by the rest of them. Is more of an intimidating presence than a real threat, but nonetheless complicit in allowing the rest of her gang to be unruly.
They were weird kids and misfits, that is true. However, they did specifically bully Basil. We don’t know if they bullied anyone else, but they did torment one kid.
>This seems to imply they aren't out to actually hurt anyone, further evidenced by Basil not really being injured when we see him, implying that they don't actually try to physically hurt him.. . Kim literally punches basil resulting in him falling to his knees crying when we first meet the hooligans in the park
I was thinking of going into more detail there, but figured people'd be able to put two and two together that I was speaking of the group as a whole. Kim herself is the most aggressive of the group in terms of temperament (as evidenced by Berly being characterized mostly as a bossy punk who headbutts Van a lot), but given she only hit Basil when he went to talk to Aubrey, rather than during the rest of the time he was talking to Kim herself, it's not hard to infer that hitting him isn't some standard reaction to seeing Basil. This doesn't justify hitting her him in that scene at all, it's just a point towards them not being physically violent as a matter of their standard interactions, as part of my overall point that they're primarily a rebellious friend group rather than people who go out of their way to victimize people.. . They absolutely bully Basil, but they're not trying to bully people as a matter of course; they're a friend group where one of their friends hates someone, so they all hate him in turn. It's wrong for a number of reasons, but it points to the fact that the reason they never really make a problem for Kel and Sunny actively, only when confronted, and with minimal actual consequences for anyone no matter the winner or loser, is because they aren't actually out to hurt people. For all other details, refer to my initial post.


SKONG INSANITY MOVING TO I OMOR NOW?!
oh damn.. also spinninleaf has a twitter?? :0
Its my main social media, i joined the omori fandom on there back in 2022 i was very late to coming to this website LMAO
ohh i see
. . I just realized where this poster comes from...
Oh god, foreshadowing
Isn’t it possible somebody else took the photo’s? I mean Sunny’s parents were pretty well off, I doubt the only way to take photos they had was a single Polaroid camera, and that they would give it to basil without replacing it.
i mean, its possible but either way these pictures wouldnt be able to be in game because of the timeline and whne she died
And also basil is the only one not pictured in the unused photos like these ones as if he took them
That is basils photo album, it wouldn’t make sense that the group wouldn’t take photos until basil started to take them. Additionally, considering Kel is half-off screen here it’s pretty obviously him who’s taking the photo.
that doesnt happen in game though im talking about in the current game and how it wouldnt work in the current game where they did in fact not have polaroud photos until basils photo album 
:( noooooooo :(
:(
how am i supposed to go to work with this much devastation in my heart
. . People often forget this but Basil didn’t start taking pictures until Christmas which was when he got his camera/s. . So the event is cannon It’s just Basil has a skill issue and doesn’t take pictures with his eyes and print them using imagination/j
this is so sad 
oh no. oh no. oh no.. .   . *someone unmake the stairen't nocident inhappen pleasn't*
I'm gonna pretend as if I didn't see that and that I'm not bawling my eyes out rn. . 
A future we never got
I think basil might as well be Yuri
I wonder why 🤔
Yeah, I guess an accident, even if it resulted in someone's death is more forgivable than being purposefully fed a lie, thinking your behaviour contributed to someone's suicide, especially the person you loved most. . . Sunny came out and took what, 3 days to come clean? Basil hid it from them to their face for 4 years. I can see how they'd be very mad.. . ...Also, Sunny's feeble and battered appearance would make it a little hard to go too hard on him. And he did save someone's life just prior, even if it was Basil. They still would never want Basil to die.
poor bagel. all he wanted was for his friends to be happy and love him but now they all hate or bully him 
Yeah, I took that end scene of his friends as literally beckoning him to die with cheer "come dream with us, Omori! Forever." . . But otherwise I think I can see your logic. Not thinking to be deserving, but yearning for it anyways... Yeah I can see forgiving Headspace versions as a result.. . Still, there would be a lot more discarded versions right? Something similar to what happens with all the Basils, where his conflicting emotions mess with his dream perception of them, "ruining" them so to speak. Basically that one dumping ground of discarded friends in Blackspace would be a lot more... filled.
>!The neutral endings can happen if you're on hikkikomori route(forced to pick either neutral ending) or if you leave Basil's house at night/after you go back to sleep and let him commit self-shearing on the route to the good ending.  Regardless, at that point you can either go back to sleep 'til the next day and leave Faraway, or you can pick up the steak knife before going to sleep and commit Basil when you stab yourself as Omori. Picking up the steak knife is irreversible, btw.!<
I don't think it represent Basil but rather Mari since according to this. . . . and Basil doesn't live on the same street as Sunny.
wow i didn't knew that , you're right
Him call weed. He no basil, he weed.

😭😭HELPPPP LMFAO
Do I need to beat you over the head with Basil’s photo album because you don’t understand subtlety?
Thats precisely my point. Subtlety. Never explicit. Thats what makes for good storytelling. I stand by what I said
It doesn’t have to be explicitly stated. . If two people are nuzzling their faces together, flirting with each other, and are the only older two in a group. . They’re probably dating
I think the ships will be very simple . sunny/aubrey. Hero/alone forever probably. Kel/some girl. Basil/and some random girl to i thin that make basil gay cause he likes flower it's very homofobic
You okay?
No
Elevator wouldn't save her either. . . Remember what happend with basil?
But it will. It's harder to >! Accidentally slice one's head off using an elevator than it is to accidentally push one down the stairs!<
[Relevant]() 
simple. they found the bug, but before they could catch it, Basil tried to take a close up pic, and it jumped out and ran away
>!OMORI becomes afraid at the end of the Boss Rush with BASIL (console/gamepass exclusive content)!<
1. That's SUNNY, not OMORI. 2. BASIL also changes into real-world BASIL, further proving that it's SUNNY.
It’s OMORI can’t you see the black and white sprite
> Maybe Sunny subconsciously recognizes that the 3-day reunion effort is his last chance to save Basil and therefore is their "last resort" in that sense as well? . . I'm not so sure on this one. By the time you reach LR the dream team is beginning to forget who Basil is, and that's probably on purpose. The way I interpret things, Headspace was created to suppress Sunny's memories of the "truth", and Dream!Basil with it.. . The act of descending in a dream is sometimes interpreted as traveling into the subconscious mind, and at the end of the previous dream segment the party falls into the Deep Well, so maybe the "Last Resort" is the last line of defense keeping the party out of the Deeper Well, and the two keys needed to unlock Black Space? . . (fun fact: the picture that falls out of the album and Basil picks up at the beginning of the game, right before he gets "taken" is visible if you freeze a vid of it, and it's actually one of the >!Black Space photos that shows Mari dead!<)
I think that the theft was recent, but her first trying to reconnect with Basil wasn't. The album seems to get passed around a lot.
Once there was a tree..... and she loved a little boy.. And everyday the boy would come. and he would gather her leaves. and make them into crowns. and play basil from omori.
Once there was a tree..... and she loved a little boy.. And everyday the boy would come. and he would gather her leaves. and make them into crowns. and play basil from omori.
that’s kinda cute ngl.
it's why he makes terrible life decisions, they gave him omori at 8 yrs old
poor little guy :(
and then the boy came back and said "I don't feel fine climbing trees anymore, I want therapy" and the tree said "i'm a tree wtf"
cmon tree, be more supportive, at least find the boy a therapist. 😔
Same reason basil compares him to the white tulips, because he is represented as boring bland and quiet
i’m playing omori for the first time too and i got the feeling that basil has autism way more than sunny. As someone that’s on the spectrum, i found some of basils dialogue and mannerisms to be unfortunately relatable.
interesting, can you give examples?
After that happens Basil also has a high chance for suicide.
At first I was skeptical, but after seeing that second image you've convinced me. Basil really was the zodiac killer the whole time.
*\*le gasp\** I knew that Basil , in reality, is just Sans in disguise, mimicking alphy's personality!
Strong evidence my friend, the second slide really opened my eyes on Basil
Stay far away from me you freak.. . Who the fuck could link Basil to that.
see this is why i hate basil
Basil will draw my cat? How kind. 
Basil being the Zodiac Killer...wow. I gotta hear you this theory in depth, man.
Oh my god, Basil has been the titular antagonist in the anime series *Monster.* Basil is the Real Monster. It makes sense now!
Who exactly is Basil? And what is he to Omori?
Sunny looks here really cynical and jaded, empty even. He comes across as a bit stand-offish to me, but he looks cool, though his current design is much better and doesn't look so gloomy and cold.. . Aubrey has a beanie? That's not the Aubrey we know and love. She does look kinda edgy here, but I like it, but am not sure if I do like it more than the one we got, but it could have worked in the game as well. Cool design.. . Kel looks a little bit smaller and a lot more relaxed than in the game. His clothes are a bit better looking, and he doesn't wear too much orange. They could have made at least make his shorts white, but I still appreciate the design we got. Kel is Kel, nothing more to be said here.. . Hero looks kinda like me years ago, I love it, I think it could have worked in the final product. He looks maybe more cute and adorable than charming, but still charming nonetheless. Cool design, could have been really used in the game.. . Rowan looks angry. Like he is really pissed and about to yell. He looks kinda cute though, and dark hair would fit him or blonde hair, but this isn't Basil. This is [Basil](), not that guy. That guy . Anyway I love Basil and not Rowan, who is not Basil, ergo I think Basil is better in both character and design. I love Basil, I could hug him so much!
Yeah, Rowan isn't Basil, This is , not that Rowan guy. This is [Basil](), not this guy called Rowan. We live in the era of Basil! 
yeah. Apperantly Basil was called Rowan and was a total bitch
Then why the hate for basil because he clearly shows Aggression for basil not just omori trying to get rid of him
That would make sense, if the two kids realized only after doing that, that Mari was actually alive, Sunny accused Basil as it was his idea to hang her, that would make sense as he (Sunny) would have thought that, without Basil's idea, she would still be alive.
I have another point in the photos of the truth basil writes “she looks asleep, but why isn’t she responding” they both would have had clear view of her face so they must have saw her with her eyes closed. If she had her eyes opens they would have been like “she’s awake” so why dose she have her eyes open when they hang her unless she opened them

bro i think you ARE the spoiler comment /nm 😭
How? I didn't confirm or deny any of your theories lmao
oh i thought that was your way of accidentally confirming 💀
Nah lol
The reason the steak got him sick is becouse he microwaved it. Microwave doesnt cook things just warm it up.
I thought it’s cause his mom stopped paying the electric bill and he just hallucinates microwaving it

have fun with the game it devastated me
At the end of the game you find basil and he epicly Gangnam styles 🤯🤯🤯 and you find out the real omo was the ri we made along the way 😱😱😱
i was thinking about how basil's something always peeked out from behind him, likely the same way sunny did while basil was hanging mari
I always thought Basil's **Something** was the tree.
Basil is staying in Hufflepuff 100% tho
\-> Slytherin, he's a snake friend. . \-> Hufflepuff, too cinnamon rolls to be Slytherin. . \-> Best cinnamon rolls of the game, good boys deserve to be on Gryffindor. . \-> Smart girl has to be Ravenclaw, she could even help the gang cheat on some exams
If basil had anger issues that he covers up we would see more cracks in his demeanor. Which we do see a ton of cracks in his innocent demeanor and the bad things that he did but those aren’t like impulsive moments of rage, but are more likely a lot of other mental disorders, basil clearly has been shattered by trauma and he shows symptoms from a lot of disorders like psychosis, depression, anxiety, dissociation. I’m not a psychologist and I dont to think he has all of these but he has symptoms from a lot of them, but he has no signs of anger issues. If omocat intended for him to have anger issues they would leave clues and hints
I think you're right. One of my biggest gripes about this game is that we don't really get to know much about Basil and how he's really dealing with things. Freaking aubrey has more character development and more screentime than basil, even though basil is such an integral part of the story. Basil's and sunny's relationship is not explored as deeply as it should've been.  I know that there's no plans at all for any sort of DLC or omori sequel for the time being, but I would really love just any sort of content from the OMOCAT team that gives more character depth for basil.
Basil is one of those characters that is shrouded in mystery in my opinion. I wish there was a hint about his past because he's the most thought provoking of the side characters. It just screams at me that this kid has some sinister past that has some explanation for his deranged view of the concept of friends and family.
So, a couple of things: I think this analysis is pretty unfairly harsh on Basil, and I think you’re overreaching on certain aspects of Basil without any evidence to back up your claims, as well as ignoring other interesting subtext that explains certain facets of him.. . Firstly, in regards to Basil’s reaction to Mari’s death, I agree, it is certainly worrying that Basil thought to frame it as a suicide. However, to label that as paychopathic behaviour is a pretty big reach, especially when Basil himself has suicidal tendencies in the game and expresses guilt for what he did. In my opinion, it’s far more likely that Basil thought Sunny would get in trouble for Mari’s death, and, considering he was only twelve, possibly thought that Sunny might even get arrested or their friends would leave him. Especially when you take into account the fact that Basil deluded himself into thinking it was impossible Sunny killed Mari, I can see why, in a state of panic during a traumatic event, he’d try to direct the blame away from Sunny in a misguided attempt to protect him. I’m not defending this decision, just saying that it makes some level of sense that a suicidal twelve year old would think of framing a manslaughter incident as suicide to protect a friend. . . Also, to say that Sunny didn’t want to go along with it is slightly misrepresenting what happened, Basil didn’t force Sunny to help him. Sunny was likely in a state of shock (Basil was too, for that matter, which is likely another factor as to why he came up with such a crazy plan) and not agreeeing or disagreeing with anything. Obviously, it’s clear that he regretted going along with Basil, but neither of them were thinking logically at that moment, let alone rational enough to refuse to go along with it. . . For the second point; Basil really wasn’t the only one in Omori who pushed everyone away, and it’s not just because of depression. Aubrey was the only one who actively tried to keep the group together. It’s said that Basil tried to visit Sunny but the only time he could, Sunny ruined the photo album, and then after that, refused to let anyone in. We also see that he was the only person who met up with Aubrey when she asked, though I imagine the reason he didn’t actively seek out anyone other than Sunny was due to guilt he felt for his involvement with Mari’s staged suicide. For that matter, Aubrey isn’t angry with Basil because he never reached out to her - that’s why she’s angry with Kel and Hero and Sunny, but not Basil. Aubrey is angry with Basil because she believed he ruined the photo album, something that was actually Sunny’s fault, and again, the reason why Basil never clarifies this with Aubrey is in an attempt to protect Sunny. . . Kel and Hero likewise were pretty unavailable, Hero had shut down, and I guess Kel threw himself into basketball and trying to keep his own family together, so neither of them reached out to anyone else. Hinestly, I kinda find it hard to believe that Kel didn’t reach out to anyone, but from what Aubrey says it seems like he didn’t, and he was trying to cope with Hero’s depression, so I guess it kinda makes sense. . . By the time the game starts, four years has passed, but Basil fully believes that Sunny doesn’t want to see him due to Sunny’s previous rejections of him, and possibly thinks Sunny hates him, which is why he turns down Kel’s invitation to hang out. . . For the third point; it’s Basil’s resoluteness to avoid placing any blame on Sunny that leads to all the trouble. Basil thoroughly believes that Sunny is incapable of wrong-doing, he has unhealthily placed Sunny on a pedestal by virtue of Sunny being his first and closest real friend. Basil does not think that Sunny can do anything bad, which is why he goes into denial about Sunny’s involvement in Mari’s death, and Sunny ruining his photo album, instead pinning the blame on ‘Something’. At the end of the game, the conflict between Basil and Sunny in the ‘good’ end arises because of this complete insistence that Sunny is blameless while Sunny is trying to get Basil to accept the truth. . . Basil not being the one to tell the truth to everyone else is important for two reasons. One; thematically it has to be Sunny who tells everyone what happened to fully realise his character arc and prove that he has accepted the truth and is no longer running away. Two; it’s not Basil’s truth to tell. Despite Basil’s involvement, it really is Sunny’s secret to share, Sunny is after all, the one who ultimately caused the inciting incident. . . Fourthly; Omori doesn’t hate Basil. I think if Omori truly hated Basil, he wouldn’t bother putting Basil in headspace at all. Omori killing Basil is the representation of Sunny trying to silence any memories of the truth, due to Basil’s involvement in Mari’s death, his very presence is a trigger for Sunny’s memories. So honestly, the fact that Omori still tries to place Basil in headspace despite this, says a lot. It would be much easier to just get rid of Basil entirely, yet Omori continually tries to fit Basil in. The headspace is implied to be cyclical, as at one point it’s said that Basil (the stranger) and Mari always try to guide Omori to the truth so they have to be erased and ‘reset’ so to say. . . I also don’t think that Omori would group Basil and Mari together if he truly hated Basil. By this, I’m referrring to the fact that at the beginning of the game Mari and Basil are together on the picnic blanket waiting for everyone else to arrive. The picnic blanket in headspace is a safe space for Omori, so I don’t think he would place someone he hates on it. . . I certainly believe that Sunny has some complicated feelings towards Basil by end game, but I don’t think hate is one of them, or at the very least, I don’t think it can be summed up solely as hate. . . In terms of Basil being the overall antagonist, I mostly disagree. . . Basil certainly represents refusing to face the truth, but he does try to encourage Sunny to move on. He shows Sunny the photo album after Mari died in an attempt to encourage him to move on, by telling Sunny that all their happy memories with Mari still exist and they can continue to make more happy memories in the future. Unfortunately, Sunny doesn’t listen to this and scribbles out the photos instead. But the fact is, Basil doesn’t want Sunny to be stuck in the past, he wants Sunny to be happy and to move on. . . I really think Basil can best be summed up as ‘good intentions, bad execution’. Basil himself says that he tries to do the right thing but always ends up messing up. Really, he needs therapy, like a ton of it, starting about ten years ago. I’d be pretty interested in playing a version of the game that’s from Basil’s point of view, since there’s very little we actually know about him that’s actually objective.  Most of what we know about him comes from unreliable narrators like Sunny and Aubrey, and even Basil himself is pretty unreliable which I think makes him a pretty hard character to get a good read on.
\^
Amazing take
i 100% agree with this statement. i believe this makes the most sense. this and the person above you with the numbered points. not to mention—they were in middle school. you usually get into middle school at around age 12, age 10 is still fifth grade. they were in at least 6th grade.. . as a 6th grader, you can most definitely grasp the concept of death, especially if you’ve had a loved one die or have seen incidents of death before. me personally, i’d already heard about suicide and mental health at this age because students go through a lot, and depending on what your home life looks like, a lot more than others. basil also has a grandmother who is ill. it’s possible she’s been very ill before. no matter how you look at it, death is a graspable concept for middle schoolers, especially if you’re mature enough. . . it would be absurd if basil was like 5 or 8 or something like that, but when you’re a preteen, hormones come into play and your thought process is different and more complex than it was as a young child. when you’re in a state of shock and the only thing you can think of is to protect your friend from blame, you think, “she’s dead, but if we keep her here with sunny at the top, it’ll obviously look like he killed her. so we have to move her.”. . regardless of his shock, he knew it wouldn’t have helped to just move her somewhere else, because then it wouldn’t make sense, and it would still be bad.. . chances are they had about 7– 10 minutes to do something about it, bc either it was only basil who had come over, or everyone else was outside of the house. if they were IN the house, they would’ve heard it. so again, it must’ve been only basil who had come over to see sunny. so they had time. while sunny was in more shock than basil, basil had more time to come to, think fast and figure things out. he had the chance to think of the most sensible way to stage it so the blame wasn’t directed at sunny. he loved mari, but he didn’t want his closest friend to hurt even more than he already was, and he didn’t believe sunny would do that. the only logical thing to do was make it look like she k..ed herself. not only that, but it was the simplest thing to do—to do it in that manner. basil may have had time to think, but he was still panicking.. . basil is a big chunk of this mishap to blame, but he’s not the antagonist. if anything, he’s more like a huge speed bump or a side antagonist. he’s not only what helps sunny get out his anger, realize his fear, understand his trauma, and move past his trauma, but he’s also his closest friend. by fighting and making up, he’s healing the guilt he had in his heart, and by fighting at all, he’s listening basil and realizing just how badly basil is going through it and how badly basil WANTS to let go, but can’t. he’s not so much fixated on sunny, but fixated on the fact that if it gets out that sunny killed mari, sunny will suffer, and that sunny is his closest friend, and he doesn’t wanna lose the only good thing he has left right now after everyone separated.
I do agree with most of your points and I find your view on the Omori/Headspace Basil relationship interesting.. . However, while I obviously agree that Basil's tampering plan was effed up, I don't think he had to have ASPD to come up with it. 12yo children totally grasp the idea of death and suicide themselves, but probably not their extremity (especially if they haven't deal with bereavement yet). While I think Basil's reaction can be seen as far-fetched, I wouldn't say it's downright impossible: it would only require for him to have heard of a teen killing themself because of pressure, whether it be in his distant relatives or in the media, and to think it would be a possible way of dealing with this "mistake". (But hey, that's just a theory, my two-cents theory). . ~~Also, Flowey isn't a sunflower but a buttercup.~~
I now got a question.. . What is Basil’s Somthing?. As far as we can see, it is an amoeba like being.
Here's an illustration someone made that possibly explains Basil's Something shape.. . [. . I consider this my headcanon, it makes a lot of sense.. . Also, side note, I find it interesting that Omori/Sunny's Something *follows* him, while Basil's seems to be actively surrounding him. Probably a reference to how Mari's death *haunts* Sunny, while the guilt of what Basil did is literally *consuming* him.
That last part about sunny’s something following him vs basil’s something surrounding him is such a good interpretation. It has to be intentional because it fits way too well into their characters and story for it to be a coincidence
This is an older comment, but I completely agree with this. It's something I noticed as well, and I think using the word 'consuming' is perfect. Not only due to how Basil tries to, and really fails to, deal with his trauma, but also Basil's Something has Basil *in it's mouth.*
I don't think its fair to say that SOMETHING is completely basil's fault. Sunny is the one that >!killed mari!<, and that guilt would've existed whether basil was there or not. Basil just found what he believed to be a solution, he didn't have any way of knowing how much harm that would do, he was 10. I'm not saying basil is without fault, but he wasn't purposefully malicious or anything.. . I would argue the main antagonist of omori is omori, with the protagonist being sunny. The game is ultimately about an inner conflict, with the majority of the game taking place in headspace. Plus the good ending involves>!omori being defeated, and sunny forgiving himself and confessing, and the bad ending involves omori defeating sunny and forcing him to kill himself!<
Okay, that's true. Sunny likely would've developed a SOMETHING regardless I suppose, but we can at least blame Basil for >!hanging Mari!< and all the problems *that* caused. I don't think him being 10 and afraid would be an excuse. I mean, the act of setting up a >!fake suicide!< is an incredibly elaborate, twisted idea.. . If he simply wanted to hide the fact that Sunny >!killed her!<, there are a dozen other ways that he could've done that. I definitely think Basil must have had some sort of f\*cked-up past or previous trauma that made him who he is. No normal 10 year old comes up with ideas like that. I don't even think many 10 year olds understand the concept of >!suicide!< to begin with.. . As for what the main enemy/antagonist is, you're totally right. I think it can be seen either way. Perhaps a more apt word for Basil's role would be "catalyst." He's basically the cause of Sunny's inner conflict in both the real world, and Headspace. Remember, the whole Headspace adventure *starts* because of Basil.
>I don't even think many 10 year olds understand the concept of suicide to begin with.. . Me from back when i was 10 begs to differ
they weren't even 10, they were 12
basil would be crying his eyes out if he saw this
I would want to hug Basil and I think Basil needs love and a therapist. The poor kid suffered a lot. I just think he's weird and his actions are highly questionable.
1: Something is not entirely Basil's fault, the guilt would have been there regardless, although it wouldn't show up in the form that it did. Also, the game heavily implies that Basil was already suicidal before the recital's date, and he says before the fight with him starts "You... you couldn't have done it. It was something behind you, wasn't it?" His mind completely denies what happened in an attempt to protect his image of Sunny much like Omori denied the truth. He was a panicked 12 year old trying to protect his best friend from actions he didn't think they did.. . 2: On three days left Basil does say his grandma hasn't been feeling well, which is a valid concern to want to go home for. Basil also at that point does not realize Sunny is going to be moving away. Another thing is that when you are dropping him off at his house he panics and says "Wait! Please don't go!". . 3: As I already said in 1 he doesnt believe Sunny did the push, and if Basil doesn't think that Sunny pushed Mari, how can Basil blame Sunny for it??. . 4: Omori does not hate Basil, the reason Omori kills Basil in black space is because he is most closely connected to the truth, and therefore keeping Basil around is threatening the truth being revealed. In black space Basil does not die in the majority of the rooms until he asks if he can talk to Omori about "something" (aka the truth) and that is the point when Basil dies, as if he were to continue he could reveal what really happened. Also, in the beginning of the game Basil does not dissapear until he sees the photo of the violin and realizes Mari's true fate.
This is more of your point of view of him than a critical look, I disagree with some of your thoughts
damn, i love you. thank you for writing this. in advance, im trying to improve my english, so im sorry if its kinda messed up. anyways,,. . i never understood why people is so in love with basil. i literally think hes so creepy. ok, cute flowerboy and stuff, but still creepy. as you said, **"Sunny's SOMETHING and the hanging of Mari are 100% Basil's doing, and there's almost no way to frame it otherwise."** if it wasn't for basil's STUPID idea of hanging mari, maybe sunny would be way less traumatized. if it wasn't for the hanging, the whole main characters group would be able to grow properly knowing mari's death was an accident. i guess i can also add that hero, for example, wouldn't blame himself as much as he've done as thinking mari killed herself. basil's idea of hanging mari up messed with all of his friends lifes. and he just seems to kind of move on over it. **No normal** **~~10~~** **12 year old would do this.** no normal 12 year old would even THINK ABOUT DOING THIS. ITS CREEPY. . . at first, i thought that basil were just trying to help sunny, playing the cute protective friend role, but something is kinda off to me. i agree that he seems kinda obssessed, and i cant see him being sunny's best friend in a healthy way, and i also agree that sunny seems to be kinda annoyed by basil's presence as well. . . i was supposed to write a bit more but trying to translate some unconcrete thoughts to english is very tiring to me. again, sorry for my kinda bad vocabulary and stuff.
Yes, it was 100% Basil's fault (the hanging, not the killing), but while the notion that he could come up with the idea of a faked suicide is subjective and up for debate, the fact of the matter is that he made a mistake. Just like Sunny, who pushed Mari down the stairs, they both made a mistake, and that's okay.   . His intentions during the incident were pure. He just wanted to protect Sunny, admittedly through questionable methods.   . . . You say that Basil has seemingly just "moved on" from hanging Mari, but that isn't true at all. Hell, for as long as we see Basil in the game, he is haunted by what he did, as is Sunny. They both have a mountain of guilt that came from the event, so no he hasn't just "moved on" from it. Basil avoids Sunny in the real world largely because he thinks that Sunny hates him for what he did. . . &#x200B;. . Sunny is not "annoyed" by Basil's presence. Sunny still feels the guilt from the event, and Basil is a prime trigger for those memories, which he has suppressed. Omori gets rid of Basil in Headspace because Basil's presence risks the truth of the incident being brought to light. Sunny doesn't even remember what happened for most of the game.  . . . You seem to really dislike Basil for what he did with the hanging, and that's totally fair. It was pretty messed up, and while I personally think that 12 year olds are completely capable of staging a suicide, it's definitely still a stretch.   . The fanbase loves Basil though because we have forgiven him. It was a mistake, that he had to deal with. Funnily enough that's kinda a big theme of the game, learning to forgive the past and move on.
100% got your point. some of your sayings partially changed my point of view. despiting it, im not going to keep the discussion longer going bc its truly hard for me to keep long conversations in english, since my vocabulary is really limited, so i get kinda incapable of really exposing my thoughts. thanks for taking your time and answering me tho!. . &#x200B;. . edit: grammar
btw, i was thinking and i got the game more like "accepting your mistakes and forgiving yourself", not like, forgiving others. even if its my favorite game and full of learnings, i dont think i could forgive someone who did something like basil. i could understand, but not forgive. . . i kinda dislike him, but can see why he did what he've done. forgiving is truly personal and all my thoughts on basil doesnt mean that i wasnt able to understand the main theme of the game.
I believe that there's always redemption to be found in people who have the right intentions, but yes, it's totally personal and depends on you.
Basil thought he was protecting sunny by not telling the truth, basil wasn’t forcing sunny to tell the truth, basil just genuinely wasn’t going to tell the truth because he thinks he’s protecting and helping sunny by keeping the truth to himself. I’m not saying basil is right, but he genuinely believes he’s helping sunny, you got the whole “basil is a coward forcing sunny to handle his mistake” entirely wrong, basil thinks he’s helping sunny
I think something isnt being said here. Basil was acting selfishly because he was afraid he would lose sunny. Simply put. Sure. He also told himself he was "helping" but that isnt the truth. Not 100%. Basil even looks creepy. His eyes are so wide and manic looking. Not innocent or sweet looking to me. The rest is just around it. Like scenting a corpse with rose oil to hide the smell. . . Basil calls sunny bestie. Neither sunny nor omori return this feeling toward basil. This was an unhealthy possibly toxic relationship from way before mari it seems. It has crossed my mind a number of times if basil was struggling so much because he was glad mari was gone. Glad the freind group broke up because it meant he had sunny all to himself. I understand theres no facts to back this up. Which would cause a whole lot of other guilty feelings. Maybe the basil suicide is a kinder ending than even the secret one. . . Theres just something about basil that doesnt add up. Sunnny easily could have avoided blame because maris bad leg and people fall down stairs and die sometimes. Basil could have just lied and said he and sunny were out playing or something. Having a snack in another room. Anything. But to frame it as a suicide first thought also strikes me as strange. Say what you will of 10/12 yos, but even most adults minds wouldnt instantly leap to that. . . I also feel that the embodiment of the Something wasnt purely sunnys idea. Basil Said it was Something behind him. That exact word even. Something. Not every 10 or 12yo sees or tells themselves theyre seeing weird things behind their besties. Basils mind instantly went there. That denial. It wasnt all just sunny alone creating this. . . Sunny isnt innocent. He lost his temper and killed his sister. He didnt lie about it on his own merit tho. Basil decided to lie. Because basil was so afraid to lose sunny all big eyes and quivering lip. Basil was afraid to lose sunny because of basil not wanting to be left alone. Basil hurt the group by lieing and encouraging, nay, pushing a lie. Imagine. Hero is off at college assuming some made up responsibility for all of this. All of this ttime. Like. That fucks with a person. His every relationship will be strained a bit when and if hero tells his partner. . . Whoever said above that accountability still applies and is important despite being mentally ill was spot on. Basil doesnt get a free card here because uwu so cute flowers and softboi. . . I dont hate basil. Sunny still killed his sister and also deserves to be held accountable. But basil isnt just give us diabetes sweet baby. Nor is sunnny. Sunny lost his head. Shoulda calmed down for 40hearts.. .  Sunny didnt automatically decide to lie and cover it up. That was basils doing. And that lie made everything more awful. Basil made up the lie to selfishly protect sunny for basils own reasons. To keep sunny around so basil wasnt left alone. I dont think basil gave 2 fucks about the rest of the friend group really. Not like he did sunny. . . Which is why op made this post about basil being the antagonist. . . I also think aubrys a bitch in faraway land and that sunny was kind to change her into a sweet nice girl in dreamworld. I guess theres all kinds of levels of shit people in this game. Lol. Kel is pretty self absorbed but sweet and loyal. Hero just lost his gf to fake suicide and judged himself harshly for it, meanwhile totally missing basils mental illness. Sunny just walks away from hero leaving him crying in the piano room. . . Tldr- basil lied for selfish reasons and op has mostly good points. Finally someone said it. Somebody had to. What an awesome thread to read through.
*sigh*  . reddit.
1.)  sunny would have been haunted by something either way the guilt would have still been there just not in the form it takes in the game. . 2.) sunny didn’t even remember the truth at that point so of course he would have been fine with hanging out with kel. By pushing others away he was only hurting himself not others. Aubrey was pissed at him because he covered all the pictures in the album with black marker. . 3.) it is equally their responsibility to admit what happened. Basil for staging it as a suicide and sunny for killing her in the first place. You can’t act like basil is the only bad guy here while sunny is a saint both of them did something extremely wrong. When does basil make sunny feel guilty for the hanging? Where did you get that from?. It was never necessarily shown that sunny blamed himself for the staged suicide just that he was traumatized by it. The stranger was urging sunny to discover the truth for himself and not to continue living in a fantasy that doesn’t mean he blames himself for what basil did but for killing Mari. It was kels idea to go through the photo album and basil only reluctantly agreed. Aubrey is the one who took the pictures of Mari away not basil. Basil also needed comforting for his trauma even if what he did was stupid and it’s not like sunny was being much better by forgetting what happened entirely. He stabbed his eye out when he was going through a psychotic break it’s not fair to judge him doing that when he was going through that and by that logic sunny was also being bad by beating up basil. They were both fighting and both got themselves sent to hospital. Basil was still knocked out when sunny was admitting the truth lol judging by the secret ending where basil’s and sunny’s somethings disappear it seemed that basil also overcame his trauma and he may very well have done the same thing.. . 4.) it’s like you said basil kept on being killed because omori didn’t want the truth to be leaked to sunny although it’s true sunny may hate basil but that just a theory. When was headspace obsessed with omori? He wasn’t even there for the whole game for us to see any proof of that.. . 5.) sunny was never trying to move on he just forgot what happened completely and once he remembers he has a psychotic break like basil causing them both to fight. Of course it would be hard for basil to move on after constantly being haunted by his own something and having the ONLY other person who knows what happened and who could help him overcome their trauma together lock himself at home yes it’s his job to make the first step but it’s insane to think he can just do that so easily under those circumstances. Sunny came to basils room to save basil but the fight was caused by their somethings irking them to remember sunny was also going through a psychotic break neither of them had moved on yet sunny remembered the truth just before that lol.
The problem isn't that basil isn't letting go of the past, because honestly the thing he did is horrible and he should in fact feel guilty. The problem is he blames sunny, too, as you said, equally even though it wasn't his idea which was very unsuitable and unsettling for a 12 y/o.
tbh when i was 12 that would have been my first thought too
you and a lot of people here are fucking stupid
Now now, I wouldn't say that. Just misguided and with a differing opinion. Let's be civilized, please, even though this *is* reddit.
No offense, but between the bad takes, misconceptions about the game, ableist sub-text and double standards in favour of Sunny, the title "A ***Hypo***critical Look at Basil's Character and Actions" would honestly be more fitting.. . Not trying to antagonize you, just seriously don't understand your thought-process here.
This is really interesting!!  I appreciate all the thought you put into this!
uh 1. BASIL hasn't pushed anything on SUNNY, hell he denies SUNNY was even involved. 2. Assuming BASIL's SOMETHING is MARI's corpse at the bottom of the stairs, SUNNY created his SOMETHING. 3. BASIL was having a breakdown during his fight with SUNNY, he didn't show him the photo album, he gifted it to him hoping he would feel better, he wasn't doing anything intentionally. 4. SUNNY and BASIL consider each other their best friend, SUNNY would have never saved BASIL if he hated him. 5. BASIL's first thought being to hang MARI clearly shows he had some mental issues or suicidal thoughts. 6. What SUNNY did can't be excused either, he's not a better person than BASIL nor is BASIL better, nothing they did was out of malice. 7. He's pushing everyone away because it was likely he would commit su!cide and didn't want to be close to anyone, OMORI takes place during the 90s - 2000s, a time where it was harder to get mental help and one would be ostracized for it, so it's 10x harder for people in that time to open up, treatment has only gotten better. Also, BASIL is  an accomplice, nothing more, definitely nothing less, SUNNY would be a culprit.
damn the omori fandom 3 years ago was sure Something...
I just wanted to comment that I agree with most of your points, I was planning to do a write up like this. I know they were kids and all, and Basil was terrified of what others would think of Sunny or otherwise, but I can’t find a reason to think >!staging a suicide!< would be a good idea. His intentions weren’t malicious, but damn did his (their) actions serve a lot of consequences. . . Everyone responds to trauma differently, but even as someone with extreme attachment and abandonment issues, I wouldn’t think of doing this in a million years. I think people forget mental health issues doesn’t mean the individual shouldn’t take accountability. I just think Basil (and the rest of the gang really) need to process everything in therapy.. . >!The controversial piece in which Sunny shouldn’t take as much accountability, I unfortunately agree because there’s a difference between an accident versus intent.!<
Hardly their fault? How is that hardly their fault that they didn't help friends in need after such tragedy when they obviously needed them?
Tbh the idea of suicide being the solution to a problem isn't exactly psychopathic behaviour. We've actually seen this with Omori, and everytime he wants to get out of whitespace or anywhere in black space he has to stab himself, and Sunny literally had 2 endings where instead of confessing, he kills himself. And this kind of aligns with my experience with depression and suicidal tendencies, where it just seems that suicide is the best solution out of any problem, regardless of the aftermath cuz well, you won't be there to deal with it.. . Basil also has an ending where he kills himself instead, so I wouldn't say it's far fetched to say he also has suicidal tendencies. And i also think it's not that far fetched for 12 year olds (they were 12 when it happened) to understand the concept of suicide, or at least for Basil considering he had a rough childhood filled with abandonment issues. Is it still messed up? Yeah, but the situation itself was already pretty messed up.. . Idk i dont think SOMETHING was 100% Basil's fault, considering yk Sunny technically still did push her even if it was a freak accident, the freak accident could've been avoided, just like Basil's idea of covering it up. . Besides i actually think the SOMETHING wouldve just taken a different form if Basil wasn't involved
No no, I understand why they have suicidal feelings. I'm saying it's psychopathic behavior to FRAME an accident *as* a SUICIDE. That's weirdo behavior. It was a genuine accident. Any normal kid would be crying and screaming to their parents for help. I don't think the "they were panicking" excuse really explains how Basil came up with his plan.. . Like, what normal 10 year old witnesses an accident like that, and worries about... I dunno, getting in trouble? I just wish they'd explain his motives more. Did Basil think his friends would hate him? That's certainly what Sunny/Omori thinks will happen if he tells the truth - but that makes sense, he's the one who pushed Mari. Why would Basil need to cover up the truth... to protect Sunny?. . At the very least - Basil is creepily attached to Sunny. Maybe not to the point of being a psychopath but it's creepy that he'd cover up what Sunny did just to protect him.
The way i interpret it is that Basil only came up with the staged sewerslide as a split second decision that was mostly based on kind of a fight or flight state of mind. He knew that sunny would get in big trouble if nothing was done to mask the situation, and he dosent want that to happen because yes, basil does in fact have an unhealthy obsession with sunny. Those kinds of things tend to happen in kids with abandonment issues, i mean it kind of makes sense. Basil ´ s parents were rarely ever there for him and so he needed someone else to latch onto and seek support from. And that person just so happened to be sunny
holy shit how did i just now realize how late to the party i was mb
I found this searching for character analysis posts for Basil. I vehemently disagree with how you interpret trauma and individual agency...sure, OMORI started hanging out with Kel out of his own volition but a series of conditions had to be met before he could actually Overcome Something. In Basil's case he might need to latch off his guilt before connecting with others. This inverts the chronological order but still makes sense. Basil may be *unable* to connect with others, unlike Omori, as trauma is a personalized little box of hell.          . But mostly I am interested in your take that Basil represents "not letting go". I didn't think you elaborated much on that and it's honestly it sounds like the more interesting part. Do you remember your thought process?
Finally, someone who makes valid points against Basil and doesn't just say "I don't like him.". . Though I do have to disagree on most of what you say PURELY on bias in favor of liking Sunflower, I am willing to subvert this and make an argument.. . I think Basil *definitely* has metal problems. Don't know what, but he definitely does. I doubt he is a psychopath or something, though. He probably just watches too much crime drama or something lmao, we don't got enough proof to really speculate at all on why, though.. . Also! We don't know much about the truth- the most we know is stuff pulled from the files as descriptions of the truth photo album, which isn't automatically. If it isn't canon, we have *no idea who thought of hanging Mari.* If it is canon, Basil thought the idea up, and Sunny followed through with it. Whether or not he knew what he was doing is irrelevant, as if that's your argument I can argue by saying Basil had no idea what *he* was really doing. He could have thought up methods to help Sunny, picked one and then his body went on autopilot. Likely more conscious, yes, but still not as conscious as you make him out to be.. . Though, all of this is speculation, and we don't know enough about Basil to make an accurate assessment on his character or anything else about him. Suffice to say, to each their own.
Your point is interesting, however, I do find one clear discrepancy.>! If Basil and Sunny left Mari's body with the pieces of wood of the violin, the police would notice quickly that piece of the evidence. But, I wonder how they would figure out anything further after that, they may investigate the entire house and eventually find the toy box in the storage room, but they would need to find the key for it, and the key for it is in Basil's room, and I don't know how they could inculcate Basil into this ONLY if they didn't search for fingerprints in her body, clothes and the rope. But, as it is, these are all theories, but since we're assuming that they're in the US in the late 1990s, I believe the police were a bit less incompetent in this (not saying I know more than them) than what they currently are, but it's up for grabs.!<
They definitely did, but sticked to the suicide version publicly. Something tells me that Basil's parents knew too (obviously, Sunny's parents would have the hell of a talk with Basil's folks, because WTF?), which is why they never show up in town despite occasionally visiting before the accident.
Basil's parents knowing it would be very disturbing, because we know that very little time after the accident, Basil's parents left and put Polly as the caretaker for him and for grandma. So... would they leave Basil knowing that his son did such a horrible thing (even if just speculating, they weren't that close to Mari) and don't wanna live under the same house as him? Maybe even her grandma noticed but forgave him? It could've contributed to his Grandma's bad health from the family traumas she had
Yeah, that's what I think happened exactly. >!That's also why he plans to commit exactly when his grandmother's health gives out and actually does when she passes.!< He feels it's because of him.
It probably would've enhanced the grandson-grandma relationship, doing something horrible that your parents don't even live with you anymore or forgive you but your grandma stays with you and cares about you. In that case, although we know that his grandma was a big part of his life, it would make it even more sad knowing that the only one who forgave him for the truth is gone... In general, I think Basil is the character that suffers the most by far, even if he did such a heinous act of pretending a suicide, he deserves care, love and respect, not only because he's a human being (specially a child of his age, which we all know are very vulnerable), but because he did and kept all of this for Sunny and his loyalty to his best friend is not something we could all easily find 
*Killed a family member?*. . Better Call Basil!

That… literally didn’t happen. It’s explicitly stated that Basil was trying to stab Something, mistaking Sunny’s eye for the hallucination. And if that was the case, Basil wouldn’t be smiling in the secret ending, since he purposely stabbed his best friends fucking eye out!. . Idk, this theory seems like just another way to demonize Basil, just like the “Mari was alive when she was hung” theory.
thank god he just halucinating and not being yandere
Something must have shrinked it's eye by about 5 times.. . Sure can see the part where it's seemingly intended to indicate dislike of Basil's existence.
Or Basil was aiming at SOMETHING's eye 
I don't think he was trying to stab Sunny or anything but how was Basil able to see Sunny's something? And like, even if Basil was hallucinating, How did Sunny and Basil manage to have the same exact hallucination?
Shared psychosis, my friend. 
this is just another theory to demonize Basil… I’m pretty sure it’s canon that Basil was trying to kill the hallucination
: Basil I don't want to fight you!. . : If I'm going to hell for this, at least I want you to be with me, my sunshine ♡. . : You're a psycho. . : Look who's talking
Yeah that's how I interpreted it 😭
Seems like another theory to villainize basil :’)
in a relationship with who? his sleep paralysis demon?
frfr
Thats a cool fact! However I dont think that was a detail that Omocat meant to push. It is not alluded to at all that Basil is associated with Hawaii. And I think that if he was in a relationship, it would have served as a plot point in the game.
I think it's just because basil likes flowers
Now relate Omori to Hawaiian culture and we're golden
Omori doesn't take place in Hawaii?
What the fu- **slowly we shall list all possibilities-**
There’s not that many people appear in faraway so process of elimination is fully possible. So…. . We know it’s not The Maverick because of his … attempts … of obtaining affection.. . Actually we can probably rule out all of the hooligans due to they’re already established antagonistic relationship with Basil.. . We should also rule out anyone already in a relationship such as Sean and Karen.. . Pretty boy and Jock could also be ruled out this way, but it’s mostly assumed their comic is canon.. . We can rule out Bebe because of her crush on The Maverick.. . Pulling out an alphabetical list of Omori characters here:. . Aubrey’s mom is too catatonic to be in a relationship, also eww.. . Basil’s grandma (eww) and Polly should be ruled out for familial reasons.. . Really anyone who is an adult shouldn’t be considered for legal reasons.. . Cute girl Curtsey might be possible but the wiki says “Her presumed age is from 22 to 30 years old” which is out of the age range.. . Creepy guy Tucker should never be considered, besides he has… prior engagements.. . Intimidating Girl Brandi flirts with Hero, so she’s probably out.. . Ponytail girl grumps that love is gross on 2 days left. So, not her.. . Small girl Joy might be possible but I’d assume her to be too young.. . Same thing for Smart looking boy Brent.. . I’d assume Headphones kid Jesse is also in that category.. . While possible, I doubt either of the religious Twins, Bowen and Daphne, would be in a relationship.. . That leaves: Olive Beanie, Glasses Boy, Colorful girl Katie, The Artist, and Blue Haired Girl Cris as possible candidates.. . Mincy in technically possible, but I think she says no one has complemented her drawings before, which I can’t see Basil not doing.. . Also, there’s a character called “BROWN HAIR LADY” but the Wiki has no info on her, so I’ll just have to assume that may be possible.
That flower isn’t behind the left ear though right? It’s in front.
I heard "flower boy" means the boy who loves another boy,and BASIL was also said so somewhere in the game.We can see he may be so,I think
You said *behind* the ear, right? Basil's flower's in front of it.
1. Not in back, in front.. 2. Basil’s not Hawaiian.. 3. Basil isn’t in a relationship.. 4. You’re ruining my head cannon :(
That’s his left ears your right is his left. Lol. Also maybe your reading just m a bit too far into it he wears a flower because he likes flowers.
They know that's his left ear.
My dad used to tell me as a kid, behind the right ear was gay. Maybe he didnt want me datimg & being aroynd guts. Lol
That's his left side.
I need to see Basil with a plumeria in his hair aaaaaaaa
Hmmm interesting
i'm really curious... I wonder who she could've been!!! Who knows!!!!! Maybe she was like. The sweetest sanest character who is best friends with Basil!!!
that's very interesting... (true ending spoilers --->) >!maybe she could've been the one to stage the suicide instead of basil? I'm just spitballing though!<
Ok bagel
They killed of Basil 
Yes I know 
Meow (ya fuck that flower boy)
Meow (Im offended)
Neither basil better
tell me that basil get out the first
Speak english maybe?
Okey tell me if I don't write well so did the character named basil got voted first in the on pull . Is sentence correct mister monke?
No he did not but hs got voted out and right after was faraway bagel. That was after the some what side characters got voted out
I barely understand you still
it’s happening. bagel in among us.
It's not their first interaction btw. There was another when Omori got announced for switch.
#BAGEL SUS !?!?!?!? 😱😱😱😱
The entire team had to work overtime to get the account back in time for Basil's birthday.
>!Basil’s suicide!<
then why do you have a Basil flare?
Eat basil
Someone asked for a watermelon bun for Basil and honestly, yeah.
On pizza
Basil and sundried tomatoes
If my stuff isn’t seasoned with a healthy dose of basil, I ain’t eating none
That makes that one video I saw of basil being racist make a lot more sense...
A video like that exists?????? Why fandom why
Idk why. I didn't make it.
Its funny ok
No I meant the video where Snuuy is talking to Basil on "three days left" before they eat over at his house, but the text was edited so Basil called Kel an illegal immigrant.
WTF fandom why are you like this
QUE CARAJO HERMANO?!. . 
if only i could have a birthday party with basil. (happy birthday)
I wish
Happy birthday, fellow Basil enthusiast
Thank you fellow Basil enthusiast
I’ll definitely come to your birthday party if Basil is there
Everyone will come if Basil is there
Happy birthday, and thanks for appearing in every Basil post
I love flower boy
Hey you are the guy that started lovong basil in one day are you?. . Also happy birthday
I’ve always loved Basil even before Omori was made
uh oh my basil plant is dying. i wanted to use it tortalini
Basil plush who? This is the true god of destruction
How was LGBTQ+ forced onto characters? I don't remember anyone shoving Basil being gay down people's throats or something. A lot of people are very clear that the headcanons are just headcanons and not fact.
At first I thought it said Basil getting ripped like working out and I think that’s a better outcome
You can like Basil and still draw him getting torn apart. He’s a silly guy.
Psychopath
Na you just gotta enjoy the full range he has to offer. Cute and gory.. The character is shy, well meaning, anxious, and prone to poor decision making when under stress with plenty of guilt. . He has some great potential for both ends of the spectrum.
Alright Basil gimme 20 pushups now!. . Umm o-ok.... . YOU CALL THAT A PUSHUP! I've seen better from bun-bun!. . I'm trying guys!. . TRY HARDER!
 this is miserable!. .  how are you supposed to get strong?. .  I am strong!. .  prove it!. . (An arm wrestle later). .  I don’t understand! He’s so thin and timid!. .  skill issue!
Basil how did you do that.... . I know her weaknesses.. . Teach me.. . NO!
Yes, exactly. I don't dislike Basil at all but >! Ever since I witnessed his repeated blackspace deaths!< I can't help but sadistically enjoy his suffering.
It’s a common predicament Omori fans find themselves in. Video games do truly cause violence 
proceeds to draw basil getting **RIPPED** and **SHREDDED** in gym
I asked them if they could make basil explode and they complied, bro got blown up by a landmine
Talking about dreamworld basil btw
I love watching basil get brutally murdered 🥰
As a person who slightly dislikes basil, I can confirm I look like this
... about Basil getting ripped 
What's next? Why >!Basil x Gardening shears!< is a bad ship? 
>!Basil x stairs!<
How? It’s A Great ship!
Ah yes Basils cringe compilation
BASIL sees pictures as memories, but yeah
I think both
So Basil just had his camera out and accidentally took them
I figured he had the camera around his neck... I'm not a smart woman
Those aren't pictures but the memories of Basil.
Accually this is sunnys interpretation of what basil saw
How can it be Basil's memories when we're in Sunny's mind though, it looks alot more like this is what Sunny thinks Basil saw, he is (or used to be) really close to him afterall
Yes, that's it, I wasn't clear but that's what I was thinking

science more like AAAAAAAAA
Yeah this is just Basils POV but I love to think he just snaps a few photos he’s just savage like that
basil:*sees mari unconcious on the floor*.   . also basil:well this seems important *takes pic*
"It's should have been [Basil], not him. It's not fair!"
Hey what did Basil do
Have you ever heard about tragedy of Basilus the Wise?
no, oh great Greed Angel. Tell me of Basilus the Wise!
It's a Truth legend. Darth Basilus was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.
You forgot one thing, his reincarnation as basil.
Basil did NOTHING. . . >!And don't bring up mari!<
Of course not. It's not a story that Mari would tell you. It's a Truth legend. Darth Basilus was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic, he could save others from death, but not himself.

Basil lives on! . . (For now, because we all know there's too many bagel haters here)
i despise basil and will stop at nothing until il he is eliminated
B A G E L
My poor boy
Accidentally said the same thing twice, amnesia kicking in frr

THAT’S WHAT YOU GET FOR MESSING WITH BAGEL 🤬
Mortal of the story:. . Don’t hate on the basil fans
this is me with my friends. i have basil as my pfp on everything and one of my friends who just played the game even said he imagines basil talking in my voice but i like sunny more. i’m in too deep
Too late, you've already bonded your soul with Bagel.  . Only Bagel from here now on.
NOOOOOOO
It'll take time to adjust, but eventually it will change. Some part of Bagel will remain within you though
No I CAN PHYSICALLY NOT TAKE IT OFF IM IN SO MUCH PAIN
Oh well, then you'll have to endure this excruciating pain for all eternity. . Have fun
:(
:)
D:
I HAVE DEATTATCHED
Your pfp and flair is literally Basil what did you want
To be able to like other characters other than Basil
But aren’t you the Basil guy, though?
I DONT WANNA BE
Too late to change your public image in a big way now, I guess. Making this post was probably your best bet. We shall see if your attempt was indeed fruitful. (I don’t know why I started talking like this.)
theres no escaping the bagel… hes always there, no matter how fast you run, no matter how good you hide, he will always be just around the corner.
NOOOOOOOOOO
well you do kinda have a basil pfp and flair sooo
But I want to love other characters besides Bagel
no bagel is #1!!
But I can still love other characters too right?
yes
AAAAAHHHH MANIC BASILA
 I love this face so much
ABD. . BAD. . BAD

feral
 this face is just my personality now

basil simp
Yes! 
And 90% was caused by Basil
oh my fucking god what has this become? a war?!
NOT AGAINN!!1!!1!!!
Yes and we will win
Meow( meow>)
I agree but defending basil is more fun
WE NEED TO PREVENT THAT ASSAULT! FOCUS ON BASIL!
Vote Basil out so he can finally go home and water his flowers
Does this make Basil a communist?
BASIL WILL RETURN THE POWER TO THE PEOPLE 
THE WORKERS FORCE!!!!
Vote her out instead ->  (I love her but the least)
~~This was originally for mewo but i decided for basil since he would be more controversial~~
The council of STONKS will decide your fate! 
Pro Basil propaganda
The best type of propaganda
 \> 
\+\+<
<*
You've convinced me.
Based on your profile Pic I don't think that was a very hard accomplishment but I'll take what I can
Too bad I vote watermelon skrunkly 
So far, every post advocating in favor of keeping a certain character ends up failing. Can Basil's overwhelming popularity make him the exception though? And he has the Pride month power boost. I think he's a threat that must be addressed before it gets too late.
Stay tuned for more! 
 >!BACK TO BLACKSPACE SILLY BAGEL!<
Do you really want this crazy man ~~as your president~~ to win?. . 
yes
Of course 
100%
Yes
Spoilers?
oh sorry i thought everyone already knew
It's OK. I already know the ending, but other people might not, so remember to always put a spoiler tag on stuff like that.
ok thanks 👍
vote basil to get watermelone!!!! 🤛💥 🍉🍉🍉 🍉🍉🍉 🍉🍉🍉
KILL BASIL KILL BASIL
I Will vote Omori instead. . Because i Omor 💀
Vote Basil, Keep Hero
Agreed
BASIL BASIL BASIL!! 
BASIL IS JUST A SKRUNKLY SILLY SCRIMBLOOO!!!!!! 
[Look at the little scringly dingly]()
GET THE BAGEL OUTTA HERE. WE NEED CAPITALISM TO WIN 
As a bagel hater myself, I cannot wait to see that little mint man go in the blender (that's where they go when they lose right?)
KILL BASIL RAAAAGAHH
We need to protect the silly bagel 
I agree with you! 
 die
True
If Hero gets voted out before Basil I will fucking lose it
NO, VOTE THAT LITTLE GREEN HERB OUT, HE DOESNT DESERVE TO WIN 
Nah basil gotta go, basil main bad guy >:0
There's no bad guys though, hes just a silly little guy!!
Fair, I'm team basil but I think we agree that both are good in their own ways 🤝
Basil is flower boy, he's good I just don't mind sacrificing him for the greater good of kel supremacy
Everyone's hated him for as long as I could remember though, honestly I think the basil hate is super unwarranted like what did my boy do?? Get mad at Sunny too if you're gonna get mad at bagel for something he did when he was 12 cause they're a 2 for 1 package
I have no hate for flower boy, he's just not my top pick
What has Basil ever done for you? And what hasn’t Hero done?
r/antibasil is part of my religion. basil shouldve died in round one.
it aint death, he just being sent to water his plants
REALLLL
I voted 
DONT LİSTEN TO HİM SOLİDERS VOTE OUT FUNNİ >!JUMP ROPE!< MAN İNSTEAD
Why is your i so tall
Typical Uncle Sam trying to get rid of us Mexicans once again! WE WONT STAND FOR THIS.
No (your opinion is different from mine so we are rivals)
NO BOTER OUT BAGOILE. .   . NO BOTER OUT BAGOILE. . NO BOTER OUT BAGOILE. . NO BOTER OUT BAGOILE. . NO BOTER OUT BAGOILE
Only one of these die when you pour coolant on them I’m just sayin
 ← vote this guy out (I'm not too keen on him)
That will only want me to vote him out more 
Sorry little kid.... But you not even real
Capitalism number one! AMERICA!! YEA!! . . WHAT THE FUCK IS A KILOMETERRRRRRR!!!!!!
My reaction to that information. . 
Hero is a good boy!. . . . DOWN WITH BASIL!
Nah fuck basil I hate him
Capitalism is great
FUCK BABEL
You will pay for this 
No.
I guess bagel just doesn’t exist
Bagel is even higher
He’s the one taking the photos
He’s been recording the entire game.
Bagel Birthday 🥳 🎂 🎉
I like bagel
Me too
basil: ascended
Basil did black face
Everyone is whitewashed in the dream world too
If I remember correctly the Basil PNG is a smash bros reference. As in Basil in Smash hence why op went oh no. . I literally said we should still be supporting fanart the most. I never said we shouldn't do that. . Bruh you're literally gate keeping, low effort memes can still be joyful. Over 1k people didn't just like that post for nothing. You call it stupid but again a ton of people enjoy some if the memes you think are useless. Heck my only posts that blow up are pretty low effort memes that either drive a conversation or make people laugh.
This might sound strange. You might not even believe it. . . Basil original artwork basil
i don't understand what that means. Are you saying it's more eyecatching because it's Basil?
People recognize basil in omocats art style. . . . + . . . The fact the op typed NO FUCKING WAY which  could have sparked some interest in peoples brains . . + . . The gradient could have made people more interested but I’m not to sure about that one because they have cool colors. . . How is that? Get it? I don’t know how to explain this.
why is basil in super smash bros
That gradient background reminds me of that time Basil was in Super Smash Bros. Brawl
You don't get it, that radiant Brawl background takes a lot of effort to put into, can't you think of all the potential Basil could have against Sephiroth?. . /j in case if you can't tell
I hate the hate of basil
i hate the hate of the hate of basil
nnnoooooooo!!!!!!
yyyeeeeesss!!!!!!
i hate the hate the hate of the hate of basil /ooc
Yeah same
i hate basil because they keep chopping down amazon rainforest and that makes me very sad
If we keep getting the “why would you hate Basil” posts, we’re only gonna get more Basil haters.
Why not Basil's parents? If we can have Sunny's parents' emojis, why not Basil's parents'?
Embrace Big Molio! Leave these foolish things behind!
Because it is, the old friends reunited again, and hanging out together like they used to. If only Basil was there
'kay hold on I'll begin building the Basil mech
Please help I just got a bullet through the heart
DON'T WORRY, HERE I COME!. . *Activate Basil mech*. . *Basil mech crumbles ontop of me because I'm not an engineer*
NOOOOO MY ONLY FRIEND good thing I’m invincible and can do this forever I keep getting up no matter how many times you’ve killed me
My ghost shall aid you in battle, friend
Just throw a bomb at basil haters
I can’t I’m too nice to hurt other people
Average basil fan
basil haters: This is why bagel lovers are inferior mwahahahah >:)
But I’m quite literally immortal you can’t kill me
Ok but... What if you do a worst ending with babil...
You go to hell
good thing i‘m not
Omori wants to: lend a hand
Would basil x something shippers be a nuke...
Good thing I never got hit by one of those
You would be evaporated into dust like the funny marbel movie
I don’t feel so good
Wonder what the grenade is
Basil is my least favorite one but that doesn't mean I don't like him, he's just ok imo
All the characters are great
this it true... however, hector exists and he is a deity
None of them are bad but Basil just doesn't do it for me unfortunately. I'm a Kel guy. My ranking probably goes something like . . 1. Kel. 2. Auby . 3. Mari. 4. Hero. 5. Sunny. 6. Basil
Okay I’m fine with Basil but HOW DARE YOU PUT SNUUY THERE
Idk, he doesn't talk much. I like him significantly more than basil tho
Protec the basil
I’m in so much pain
Hang in there soldier it’ll all be worth it
I hope you’re right
If Basil wills it, I will commit any atrocities that may be prescribed. I am a fanatical pawn of Basil. There is nothing in Life except for Basil. There is nothing to live for if not for Basil. There is no hope other than Basil. There is only suffering, met with Death, in the name of Basil. And in Eternal Rest I shall be subsumed into the incorporeal grace of Basil. Embraced by the infinite flesh mass. Forever warm. Forever content.
What if I told you I was actually Basil
O:
basil and bagel are completely different characters
bagel
b
I've only encounters a couple of Basil haters but nothing serious thankfully
Some private conversations with some have not been pleasant
I'm sorry to hear that but as you can probably tell from me, no Basil hate at all friend.
Sleepy Bagel
But is it a comfy bed
this is the question
I too, would protect Bagel
I love basils character but I don’t feel like anyone can be blamed for disliking him lmao
Yeah it makes sense why
bagel.
You fool i have unlimited knifes and i wont succumb until basil is dead. . YOU WİLL GİVE ME THAT WATERMELON
I’m quite literally immortal we will be here forever
We are at a stalemate then but i will still throw knifes
Owchy
we must protect the bagel
Please, I don’t wanna get hurt
Thats a bagel
Ah yes, Bagel
If Basil was a girl, the people in this sub would like him more
I know I would…. . For no particular reason😳
Basil is cool, but not cool enough. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Am I a nuke to you by saying me and my friends make basil death jokes
You shall face my wrath
One day I'll get through, and the bagel will be dropkicked
I’m canonically immortal you can not kill me
You don't need to be dead, just in enough pieces
My pieces will still fight on
I'm the guy who could've hit bagel but intentionally hit your balls instead
I may be canonically immortal but I can still feel pain😭
Just focus on the fact that I chose not to attack bagel lol
Thank you but my balls still hurt so much
*You'd best behave or I'll do it again*
…
:)
Destroy basil
I’ll destroy you
I'll like to see you try
how dare you try hurt bagel
B-but Basil never hurt anyone! >!He just made someone who was VERY hurt look as if they committed suicide! There is a very big difference, trust me!!<
Basically every Basil fan for the most part.
Canon basil is alright but fanon basil on the other hand
Poor bagel
Fuck people who hate basil? Weird kink but ok
Didn't she also stream drawing Bagel?
Basil doesn’t deserve it. It’d be too boring anyways.
I don't hate Basil . I hate how the fandom portraits him . Downvote me all you want
Bagel haters are bad
are based*
Bagel haters are extremely based
It should be basil’s birthweek so he gets the attention he deserves
Basil overated though.
Good, basil hate is ok
i was gonna stop using reddit entirely but i’ll keep commenting for you real world basil ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i did it. . i got someone to stay on reddit holy shit
your did it
Mate, jokes were still made. Removed or not.. . Also no, I brought it up cause many people who attack Kewl are *coincidentally* Bubbly fans who casually bring up his ban as unfair.. . . Also not everything was a joke, dude had an inappropriate picture of Basil saved.
i think thats just a uniform, as we also see basil wearing similar clothes
I HAVE BASIL IN MY POSSESSION!!! OH HO HO HO HO HO❤️!!! NOW BUY MY NEW GAME, STUPID ADORING FANS OR THE FLOWER BOY GETS IT!!!. . -SWH❤️
I actually thought about him kind of just appearing from nowhere or something like that, but that could work too
You can’t I’m already basil
Thanks. Its just as of rn Most my stuff with my designs of the omori characters for my au is edits of pictures of others since my art style aint that detailed since i dont draw eye colours and stuff (by art style choice) and do this at times to get more detailed drawings of my au designs of characters . And i kinda dont feel like tracking 30 different people till i find who made wich art so the moderation of this sub dont remove the pics. (I plan on posting a drawing ill do of my version of basil soon tho)
Hi I’m Basil and I have not tried to unalive myself for the last 3 weeks.. . Hiiiiiii Basil.
Get rid of Basil and call it "Actually Good Characters".
People simp for basil? I mean he’s cute, but in a “holy shit this twink needs some therapy” cute.
Agreed, basil fans aren't necessarily simpers or horny. I don't really know the right way to describe them
No I get it lol, I was mostly kidding
. . live basil reaction to aubergine
my headcanon is that basil is bisexual with a preference for men cause I relate to him a lot n stuff so I hc him as bi like me
If DW Basil has a million fans, then I am one of them. . . If DW Basil has ten fans, then I am one of them. . . If DW Basil has only one fan then that is me. . . If DW Bagel has no fans, then that means I am no longer on earth. . . If the world is against DW Basil, then I am against the world.
Ok
i voted out basil but upvoted for your dedication
real
Bagel
Unfortunate news
He's public enemy #1 rn
Real 
I don't think any amount of propaganda from my part will save him. I will try anyways
Yeah I don’t like where this is going
People who only hate HS Basil
You posted this twice
I did?
I thought i only.posted this once
I believe i deleted the second post now
It shows up twice on the sub.

FIENDS!!
The subs option on Basil (both versions) change so frequently I’m just done with it.. . I like Basil cause he reminds me of myself, and HS version is I what I want to become (less nervous and stutters less)
If the everyone loves him I'm everyone.. . If there's only one basil fan that's me.. . If the world hate him I'm dead.. . If all the world it's against him I'm against the world.. . I will protect him No matter what 
As the person who is uniting Mewo fans and Jawsum/Hero fans to take down Basil... *yep*
Why is there so much Basil hate in this sub? He's one if not the person who suffered the most, he didn't move on to something else or make new friends nor hide in his imagination, he just lost everything and suffered quietly for years with no one to turn to and the only reason Basil wouldn't come clean is to protect Sunny, because he's that much of a bro.. . Basil is precious, just imagining the ending where you don't water the plants hurts me physically.
It ain't Basil hate, is just that we wanted to save Mewo and he was the 2nd most voted, plus some propaganda that was against Hero, who was also being supported by Jawsum fans. Like we love Basil, we just took him out for other reasons. . Not planning on taking out the RW version tho
WHY DO PEOPLE HATE BASIL
BLEND THE MINT MAN, WATCH HIM GO, WHEN YOU GET ELIMINATED YOU GET BLENDED!!! 
Ayo Gin, Basil, and Chihiro are my comfort characters too! Anyways you’re a hurt soul, aren’t you?
Let’s be friends as well
I’m down :D
Gin protection squad
Let’s be friends
Basil, chihiro, clearly a fellow femboy or just really enjoy cute things (also really cool)
...
Im wrong aren’t i?
You aren’t wrong you are absolutely on point
Oh thank you
Basil, Chihiro, AND Ryota? Seems like we have similar taste in comfort characters
 I see Basil. I agree
who the hell are these people (aside from basil)
Lots of Danganronpa, Gin from Your Turn to Die(2nd fav visual novel), Klaus from A series of unfortunate events and Mino from a game I can’t remember
Thank you
Literally the only people here I recognize are Basil and Klaus
I don’t know how to pronounce 50% of their names
Gin from your turn to die is the boy with the plushy. Basil is from a game called omori(which is pretty obvious). And the girl in the front is called mino
>mino. . where is the mino girl from ?
ayakashi akashi
That right there is a post made by someone who didnt witness the basil war
the **W H A T** 
Oh yeah there was a war between r/probasil and r/antibasil
THERE'S SUBREDDITS
Also r/basilcult
The plot... thickens
I thought you said “The plot… chickens”
I thought it was something much worse.
I'm anti basil
Cool
No, people being autistic here
Fair point
The Basil War happened within like a week of me joining this sub…Twas a stressful time…
glad i wasnt there then
**Vietnam flashback**
Post Traumatic Stress Disorder intensifies 
That was peak r/OMORI
Why you steal peoples posts lol.
It’s funny
Being here when it started makes me feel old
I don't think I was even on Reddit at that time due to all my old accounts being banned lol (This is my third one)
I REMEMBER THAT SHIT IT WAS WILD 💀💀
huh, i guess this guy's a relative to patrick star, because he's been living under a rock his whole life
It seems im also a relative to patrik star-
Meanwhile in A03:. "I Will Cherish You Forever", intensifies
What's that? I keep hearing about it but I can't find it 
A post good ending fic where Sunny Is forgiven for what he has done whilst basil isn't.. Sunny is given a good ending while Basil is shunned and abandoned by the friend group, especially Aubrey who even uses her nailed bat on him.  . The author then decides to turn Basil into a Yuno Gasai clone for some fucking reason and has his sanity lower to the point where he is stalking his friends, taking pictures behind their back. After they eventually find out and Hero confiscates his photo album, Aubrey steals it from Hero and sets the photo album on fire in front of Basil's doorstep with no remorse whatsoever.  Basil finds out and is driven into a psychotic breakdown in which he accidentally kills Polly, and then deludes himself into believing she killed herself right afterward.. . Tldr: The author is so fixated on making Basil suffer whilst also trying to paint him as the villain of the story that it's just sad.
Omori fic writers try not to make the characters psychopaths challenge
omori fanfic writers try not to make basil a deranged stalker challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]
 oh boy  . . . persuit sounded more appealing by description than this. what the hell is that
Basil can be forgiven to certain extent. But if Basil never got it's forgiveness, it shouldn't be like that.
I am curious. . Care to share a link to the Fanfic? (I cannot find it)
Here,have a panzer. . 
Panzer 4 jumpscare . . 
There is a whole subreddit dedicated to hating him
kid named r/omori and omori tiktok:
Kid named sussyimposter:
Kid named glen quadmire:
I am mentally and physically not able to tell you how many fucking times this joke got made.
. . Right, explain this then
GET HIM OUT OF THERE
don't you dare 😡😡. . 
I won’t, but some subs would…
I will fight them
The reason you don't see them that much on this sub anymore is because everyone else agrees that they're obnoxious, toxic, hypocritical, their takes have zero nuance to them and they can't even make a proper argument to justify their views even if their lifes dependend on it.. . As a result they get ratio'd on a common basis and thus opt to simply lurk around in this sub.. . I assure they very much exist and there are quite a lot of them.
orrr they just hate the character????
Found one! Set the missiles to his co-ordinates!
count your days.. . 
only 3 now.
. . Sorry dudes but I don't like him
The fact that he's a *him* makes me dont like him in the first place GNAHHHH
U don’t like that basil is a boy?? wha?
It's easier to find them anywhere where there isn't a hivemind of some sort.
They're all in jail, that's why.
I understand why people dont like Basil, but personally hes my favorite character. I get he did bad stuff but the whole point of the game is about forgiveness, and yes what he did was horrid but at the same time he suffered for 4 years because of it, and i feel like thats punishment enough. I really dont care what people think of him as long as they arent annoying about it, but i think he deserves forgiveness. I will admit im super biased, since Basil reminds me a lot of myself (ignoring the incident of course, i havent killed anyone) but the incessant haters are still annoying. Oh that was a bit of a rant- sorry i tend to ramble 
I am a basil hater. 
Why? >!Did he claim your kill or something?!<
Yikes, take my upvote and go
r/angryupvote
Yes

Ok

No I've seen them..
Basil war flashbacks  If you look at the antibasil sub desc it has the signed treaty. . * Antibasil war veteran
How long are you on the sub?
me
It’s me. I’m the Basil hater.. Genuinely on my first playthrough I hated this fucker. Still was committed to saving him tho cause he part of the squad.
Honestly, I kinda didn't like him for some reason. But not for any specific reason he just is... Off... to me. I wouldn't consider myself a basil hater but not exactly a basil liker
Oh yeah no there do be a lot of basil hate, a lot of fanart of him dying or being tortured and the such
The only argument I’ll accept against him as valid is that >!what he did felt too on-the-rails and like a plot device for someone like to him to actually think up.!< Personally don’t think that’s worth hating his character and there’s a lot else about him to appreciate but I do respect anyone if they can’t overlook that detail or just flat-out don’t like him.
You just haven’t been here long enough then.
the wattpad comments i've seen on some fanfics say otherwise. basil will say a line and everyone's like "bruh shut up" or something 😭
I have seen them in like every comment section I open — which admittedly isn’t EVERY post, but there are definitely people who don’t like him lmfao
The sub has their i have no enemies arc rn. . 
Better start editing your meme then you motherfucker
I've def seen hella basil haters, like they be HATING him 😭😭😭

i see basil haters everyday sadly. i love his character sm
I mean, yeah. He's definatley my least favorite character but even then i love him alot just like the other group members. (I will get erased for saying this)
I was on the “Basil killed Mari” train until One Day Left, so… 😅. . I didn’t hate him though! I loved the idea.
I mean if you think about it, if basil called an ambulance instead of staging a suicide, there may have been a chance she could have lived
wasn’t it explicitly stated that >!she was dead when she got pushed down the stairs!<
Was it? I thought that part was made purposefully ambiguous.
wait UNTIL one day left? when they were still saying she >!killed herself?!<
I thought it was suspicious the entire time 😅
the people who hate basil are mentally stable, meaning coming across them is hard as they aren’t in the omori fandom
It is I I am the basil hater . . Edit: I’m trolling but so what if I don’t like him?
why
I’m just making a joke, I did put the smiling basil emote after all
I'm a real basil hater
Why
the incident. . also he's weird and annoying
why are you getting downvoted for asking a question
You fuckin tell me, I'd like to know too
i hated basil with a burning passion like 3 days ago now i am pro-basil  . character development 
I'm an avid Basil hater, I just don't talk about it that much cause it'd be annoying
i don't get why people hate a sad traumatized child so much, please explain lol
why
I guess I don't exist then
im here :3

Im right here
me
You have now. Basil is overrated
I hate basil gimme downvotes. (I actually don’t I’m sacrificing myself for the greater good, the hatred has to go somewhere)
To basil obviously  /s
You dirty dog. You’ve cheated the system
That’s kinda what will happen. People will complain at people who don’t really exist, or at least not a big deal as they make it out to be.
There’s also a theory I fucked your mom last night. It has a lot more credit to it too!
They didn't lie either. Source: me
Can someone explain what there is to like about Basil? Genuinely don't understand his popularity
I mean I personally can't stand him...
Hi, fellow Basil hater here, I hate that idiot since I played the game. 
The masses are trying to subdue our uprising! #WatermelonHatersUnite 
I have seen many including my lifelong best friend lol
Bro why I'm hating basil? It's just a spice I use in my cooking.
Her: 
They are in the shadows watching and waiting for thier time
majority of this fandom hates him
Oh they exist
I don't hate Basil, he's a very well-written character. That being said, he's definitely my least favorite of the gang, as I like and resonate with the others more.
Yeah. You never saw me get downvoted to hell for daring to not hate on basil
I’m here 👋
Ngl, I don’t *hate* Basil, but I don’t *like* him too much
The closest things I’ve seen are fan arts and stuff of Basil dying (one includes Aubrey beating Basil with her bat in the hospital)
here i am
So I'm certainly not a fan of Basil, but I just had a look at r/antibasil and even I think that shit's intense
I, however, have seen several
I hate the ship but basil is precious
I don't hate him, but I clearly see a reason to. Many people on this subreddit act way too clueless when it comes to Basil, as if they couldn't complete the puzzle in their heads after finishing the game. Yes, he's cute. Does this justify anything he has done in the story? Hell no. If these events were to become public in real life, y'all would send this mf to a confinement room best case scenario.
Basil is too good. But Aubrey? I'd push her down the stairs.
I’m invisible
 You obviously have not met router
Nono I definitely have seen basil haters, I feel like I see it a lot on Pinterest, I suppose because of the younger fans..? (I am a younger fan too but like you know)
My boyfriend is the biggest basil hater ever fr
I always see people going “Why does everyone hate basil so much?” When I’ve never once seen someone hate Basil. I mean i haven’t fully played through the game so idk but they complain ab ppl hating on Basil and everyone just loves them

Here I am ✋
It's a mixed bag around here, but really why hate him? Just look at him:. . 
this man just reinvigorated my basil hate  . . . FUCK BASIL THAT STUPID BITCH IS SO ANNOYING WITH THAT BITCHASS WATERMELON LOOKING FACE LIKE BITCH GO TURN YOURSELF INTO A DONUT I DONT FUCKING CARE ABOUT YOUR PICTURES, ACTUALLY I'LL JUST FUCKING SHOOT YOU SO YOU CAN EXPLODE LIKE THE WATERMELON YOU ARE AND STOP WASTING EVERYBODY'S TIME HAVING TO TOLERATE YOU-  . . . 
Allow me to introduce myself. . 
Well,i am
>!update: i’m not gay but if basil was a real (reel) boy i’d be gay for basil!< is that it?. . >!every kel meme is canon!<
I couldn't get it because I thought the fishing reel was a pencil sharpener. I'm such an idiot.
It’s not an easy image, that’s for sure.. . I had to try a bunch of different words in my head that could work there.
I thought it was a bass drum
I thought it was a bike pedal. In my defense I've Never seen a fishing reel
I thought that was a pistol not a cannon—💀😀
Yup you got it
Basil gives bad side effects
No kidding
I love basil he so adorable an cute
Indeed, basil best boi
Indeed
basil makes me gay
A good friend too >!(maybe, but he picks his favorites you know)!<
hell if a media character helps you with your sexuality in a non-creepy way, i’d say go for it tbh
I mean, sounds to me like you're into Femboys. But heck, basil do be cute af
I’m not, but I agree with op. Basil is just wholesome. Imagine having someone as kind as Basil as a boyfriend. >!Excluding all of the extraordinarily excessive amount of trauma…!<
Yea I do love me a femboy and he’s the perfect representation of one and he’s so cute
im going to guess w/o looking at the answer that it says "ok so im not gay but if basil was a femboy id be gay for basil"
Close enough
You're not gay for Basil, but if he was a puppet you'd be gay for him?. . ***Well, that's what Spamton is for.***
Yeah but I’m not a BIG SHOT like him
Update: I'm not gay but if Basil was a reel boy I'd be gay for Basil.. . Every Kel meme is canon
Update im not gay but if basil was (idk) boy id be gay for basil. Did i get it right??
Yeah but the thing is a fishing reel
OOHHHH I SEE NOW. Makes sense
If Basil was a fishing reel?
My first guess was:. . "Update, I'm not gay, butt if Basil was a grinder(???) (sigma)male I'd bee gay four Basil."
Aww I was so close. This is what I translated before reading comments:. . Update I'm not gay ass if Basil was a tool boy I'd be gay for Basil. . (I forgot the word butt and didn't know what tool is that lol)
I’m not gay ass
UPDATE: I'm not gay, but if Basil was a PENN Squall® II Level Wind reel  male, I'd be gay for Basil
But if Basil was a …pedal male?. . EDIT: oh the comments answered my question ahaha
It's funny because "pédale" is the F slur in French
Man just be gay for Basil it’s not like the police will break down your door because you like a blonde twink
Update I’m not gay but if basil was a real male I would be gay for basil
So he can find basil
Good point.
They are the humble Basil leaves
that all sounds so spectacular!
it is spectacular
. . indeed! you deserve to have a bit of more basil to your day, here’s a picture of basil in the car.
i actually can't eat basil leaves now they remind me of him 💔
aw me too 😓
the struggles
but hey, at least we have the real awesome Basil to see!
truee
And we all feel gay when Basil comes marching home -> 
I put the forgis on the jeep
Hurrah! Hurrah!

bagel, denial is a river in egypt

Happy early birthday
Thanks dud
Happy actual birthday
You rember😁
Yeah ^•^
thanks :)
Will the Basil shirt replenish in stock if it sells out?
I’m fine with you not liking Basil boy
Did u cry?
There's a lot of Basil Enthusiasts(lovers) around!
The only logical choice is to kill non-Basil fans when they were a baby. . Or force them into art school, that works too
Alright, I'm kinda worried about this. .. can't we sigh a peace agreement with them and not...you know...kill them when they were a baby?
Not an option, mister
Oh...OH NO
most people i meet hate basil and yell at me for liking him-
Hey! basil Is cool. Don’t listen to anti basil propaganda
I like Basil but there’s always that one guy
We must fight against the anti basilists
I am and always will be a zealot of Basil. There is nothing in life except for Basil. There will never be anything except for Basil.
They said that the Basil race is the master race
Basil's cool
Blackspace was an enjoyable experience because of Basil.
Yeah, but what emote would that replace? 
 do you really want to know just what I am willing to get rid of 
Ah, okay. Maybe you should take this up with the mods, or something like that. 
Well if I’m being honest to myself, I can’t expect the mods to make a emote based off a meme.. unfortunately 
You know that a Manic Basil sprite exists in-game, right? It's part of the console-exclusive content, though. [This is the gif, btw.]()  
He looks like he's going to happily murder someone
He already did!
>!Wwll, technically he assisted with covering up the murder, not the actual murder itself!<
I am aware, but this one looks straight up stoned, *it’s special*. . But yea beggars can’t be choosers haha
no
YES! 
i really don't. . which emotr
Oh idk, maybe this one  since it’s so similar to  and 
I’m very new to this Reddit thing, I only joined 60 days ago and this is my first post. Regardless of whether I’m exposing myself for that, I need a manic Basil emote, I want it more than anything in my life right now, and if I don’t get it, I RIOT! 

Woah…. . teach me (feral noises)
!\[gif\](giphy|6pDBPCSCUmUapcsmU0). . You should copy that. Also, you should remove any \\slashes\\ that are in the copy.. . If you did it correctly, you should get this:. . 
Yes thank you!. . 
You’re welcome! If you want to use it regularly, you should put the gif under text replacement so you can use it more easily.
You are the best! 
Thank you!. .

Uhm excuse le bro it has been 15 day for me that i am here and you already changed my mindset (which i lost because of you )
Hahahaaa good! 
YOU AND THE OTHER WITCH....YOU MADE ME DRAW THIS SHIIIT
Glad to see I’m at least a little responsible for your masterpieces 
.......

You're a fucking maniac...
  <— waiting for something to happen
I don't like this image.. . This looks too creepy.
Whaaat, nah there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s just you but.. high . . And come on you think thats creepy but not this 
are u saying that this image isnt real?
Yes! That image isn't real!
does this mean i can sue them? 
Me!?!. . 
if the image isnt real and i could prove this is libel, then i get some money in my pocket! get ready! 
Good luck sueing this subreddits most feral user!.  
oh please i have been here for a long time. no one here scares me anymore. i have practically seen the heat death of the universe
It’s still bold of you to assume I have money to give!
it isnt that u have money to give, u have money for me to take 
Non existent money 
Nah it’s totally real 
Not technically what he would look like given that an actual manic basil exists in the switch version of the game, but this is funny regardless 
I am aware, the first time I played Omori was on console, it’s just he a certain face that I can’t describe that makes him different, and I can relate to him (I have a really bad smile), I dunno the kinda brain dead lion king hyena smile kinda stuck with me. . 
is basil drunk or hørny in this image
High and H0rny 
Enjoy your cursed [upscaled]() image.
YOU. . >!I love you!<

This pic goes hard, mind if I screenshot?
Go right ahead, the more merrier I say!

He looks hongry
Another reason why I can relate to him. .  <- hungry

Doesn't mix especially well with whatever the foundation of character was.. . &#x200B;. . Ignoring the upper sentence, whatever that is, it is terrifying.
It is my identity now 
….. . Why does he have a cat fang
Thats drool
Nope. Basil is now half cat, and I won’t be convinced otherwise
Very well, you’ve now changed my view of things
He looks like a drunk sloppy geezer
Who ya callin old 
He looks horny
He is! 
Me when ur mom

Yes
He looks like he tried to swallow a spoonful of cocaine
He did!
NO! SHUT UP!

Basil when he gets that Zaza (stalin will ban zaza after the invasion of Germany 1945, the eastern front.)
MANIC BASILA
Good to see u again toothpaste 
BAD


Sin sin city wasn’t made for u
Wasn't there also someone who shipped their OC with Basil?
Are you thinking of Pallette by u/Luklucik they posted here for a bit before also going dark but Im pretty sure they post more on other platforms like Twitter
they left cause people were being dicks to them. Same with kewl.
Spinnileaf is the only user I know here except for maybe Absolutebasilfan (I think that was their name). So spinnileaf.
>!Alternate ending in Omori where during a Basil fight u hand him a switch and you start playing!<

Uh oh.. I am a tiny bit taller than faraway Basil and I'm 16 lol
Basil looks like he’s seen a ghost 
Basil taller than me?!?
Absolutely NO SPOILERS no matter how tempting it may be, stay away from anything remotely Omori related (including this subreddit) until you're done as the internet is swarming with spoilers it happens so easily all it takes is one misclick. Speaking from experience  (눈\눈). . Also remember to take the time to water Basil's flowers in the Dream world as this unlocks the secret true ending. . . Have fun and prepare to become an emotional wreck :)
lol!! will have some fun and some tissues ready with me. : )
You have to use Omori to get the keys, otherwise they look like weird shadows. Open the door. Please stay away from the Fandom, and the memes. I'd suggest fighting the enemies as you find them so you don't have to grind later on but that's your choice. I hope you enjoy this game!! There's quite a few endings. Also, water Basil's flowers
Hate Basil, this isnt a spoiler for anything since I dont even know what happens in the game but just hate Basil cuz yes
Answer and open the doors, check on basil's flowers regularly, you want them watered before the end of the game
Water basils plants everyday. Dont forget!
As far as I remember Boss actually mentions that those are all holographic depictions of the bosses you fought-that's also why you can fight your friends in the basil rush
does enyone have the font for the "everything is going to be okay" text that only appears in the fight against Basil? Or at least a png of it? Its the one that looks like a heartbeat monitor.
Those are the only ones in the game files unfortunately. I think it's just a custom animation.
okay so... i ended up doing it myself, i glued together all the pieces and cleaned up the edges on photoshop. Here is the image: [, enjoy!!
that fucking basil plush gets me every time
Who’s Basil?
Type of herb I think
Thanks 👍
Ocimum basilicum
I got a fun one. . How about making Basil cycle through each emotion, and with each one you use cheer. We could end it on angry if we don't reach the ATK cap. . . That's 200% buff on each stat based on the emotion, sprinkle some snacks and a sno cone for either Omori or Basil. Since the Buffs apply to both of them.. . Then use Tulip? Or maybe flower crown for the 4x. Some Omori skills may be more efficient idk.
tulip and flower crown are both in the original post.. . Tulip is based solely on Omori’s stats, not Basil’s. Also, cheer does not give a 200% increase in all stats (it is 1.5x attack & defense, 3x for speed on console). . The damage in the original post is calculated to the maximum; everything has been considered!
Idk why but furious Basil looks like he’s sneezing
I CANNOT UNSEE IT NOW.
miserable basil trying to hold it in
>!you can stay at basil's house but not go into his room to get the neutral ending. is that the prompt you're talking about?!<
Hi! I know it’s been 8 months since you posted this, im trying to reach the 100% Omori as well, but i have a little problem with the foe facts achievement. I completed all the foes  but i forgot to deal with dust bunny in basil's house, but i don't have any save in three days left  for when i have to acces for the second time in dreamworld for go in basil's house and deal with dust bunny, and i'm currently in one day left in the hikkikomori route and i miss him. There's something i can do for this, or i have to re-play the entire hikikomori route for complete foe facts? When i try to "speak" with the bookcase, i don't see any dust bunny ( I tryed this one ONLY in the one day left in the Hikkikomori route). Anyway Thank You!
I don't know if the information is still useful to you, but you should also be able to encounter the dust bunny from a bookcase in an Otherworld house.
As a poor, humble pc player, what do basil’s different emotion portraits look like?
[They can be found here]()
Thank you :). . Also angy basil is too cute to take seriously
Your welcome!. . Also same
Could a Basil Nuke be done with Cactus as well?
You can increase its power with milk and SAD . . So if you get MISERABLE and max out defense you can do pretty good damage
The easiest way to beat boss rush with omori and basil is. to make basil and sunny happy. then use basils cheer i think it was called and increase your speed to max. boom 2k damag vertigo
Holy shit there's so many connections I missed! I knew the remote was an interesting piece of work but this is insane. Is anything unspecified to require the hikikomori route accessible without doing it?
I'm not sure what you mean exactly, but I can tell you that you can use some routes in Black Space to get to Hikikomori Route exclusive parts of it. As well as using Black Space Routes/Headspace entrances to get to the True Route exclusive sections of it!
I meant is most of this accessible outside of hikikomori? I made reference to the one shortcut I saw labelled hikikomori exclusive, but i didn't know if This applied to the list down or just to that shortcut.. . Edit: never mind, I saw the others.
ah okay! Some of them I'm not 100% sure are exclusive, but I'll update it once I find out. Sorry for the confusion!
Thanks, though I'm pretty sure I caused the confusion.
I’m doing a hikikomori run and the deep well to beach area one didn’t work for me for some reason :(
>First make sure basil has the flower crown equipped. . I always had it on, it's how I cherished Basil's wishes..  /srs
man I'm trying to follow this but even if I survive KEL's nuke, which usually toasts poor BASIL— everyone ends up forcing out OMORI's "did not succumb", and even when I revive BASIL, I can't even get half of AUBY's HP down before RNG screws me over and kills OMORI n BASIL before they get a chance to have a proper recovery . . They lied abt these simulations not being as strong as they rlly are man, they had to have lied 
Well, its essentially you as the enemy. They *are* weaker, but its what it looks like from an enemies pov
This was amazingly helpful, thank you!
I never got vertigo bc I took up keeper of the castles offer and I CAN'T get vertigo now so it there something else I could do? 
Do you know how one does get vertigo?
Thank you so much! I didn't follow the entire strategy, but I took away from it enough to get over the first few hurdles! I finally beat them!
Is Basil nuke viable in this fight?
certainly, I wasn't particularly aware of basil nuking when I had written this, but it certainly would've helped me beat the fight haha
Does he have a nuke ? Which one?
im not entirely sure but i think you setup the omori nuke and then give basil the tulip headband he does a ton of damage
Oh that’s how he learn those moves I didn’t have on him god, thx
Thanks
How to fight with only omori and basil? I mean, what is the way to do it?
First you have to beat boss rush with your regular party. Then when you beat it, go back and talk to Basil. Thats how you start. Also I'm very late
Thank you!!!!
You probably already figured this out seeing this is almost a year ago but this is a console exclusive
Bagel 
He's beautiful!

What next?
Very informative
Stop making me hungry
Thank you for your wisdom
Bad ending: Give up on omori fight. . True ending: dont give up on omori fight. . Secret ending: water basils plants every day and get true ending. . Neutral 1: go back to bed when you wake up in basils house. . Neutral 2: go to your house and go to bed after waking up at basils house. . Neutral 3: go to your house and grab the knife after waking up at basils house and go to bed. . Hikki ending: stay home and say no to Kel every day, get all hangman keys, basically neutral 3 or 2
Don't know if it is considered an ending, but there's the so-called SECRET ENDING if you water the BASIL's flower in HEADSPACE a certain number of times.
if you water them every day
To get the bad ending, you have to press no when it asks if you want to continue after you die to Omori.. . To get the first neutral ending, you have to go back to sleep instead of going to Basil when you wake up in his house. Depending on where you saved, this one might require another playthrough.. . Can’t really say what you have to do for the second neutral ending without spoiling it
You can fight with basil? Oh yeah boss mode console only ffkskglsjfjzk
You can also use the tulip skill. Plus, it sets up Omori's nuke at the same time.

You all can play Basil Rush now
how to activate basil rush? ive already beaten the normal boss rush
>To play the Basil Boss Rush, you will need to beat the normal boss rush first then interact with Basil.. . According to the mod-page.
Yea but the headspace its like rotting and omori was about to tag but It wasn't the ability and deforming all of his Friends and killing basil
. . was looking thru the files and wtf happened to basil
nah its genuinely peak omg, but i didnt see basil in-game
*walks up to Basil*. . "Sunny, is that really you?". . *walks away from Basil*
Yep
Btw I can make a tutorial how to put the characters on that fangame,like omori/sunny,Aubrey,basil etc. . . . Here basil for you guys So you guys are up to the tutorial idea?
I’d be interested, not to mention how to get the fan game itself (I’ve never seen it before lol)
Actually I will make a video
an embarrassing photo of spongebob basil took at the christmas party
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh if your talking about the neighborhood dream basil, to some he could be considered "Annoying" but thats cause hes written to be that way. Eccentric, clingy, and hyper. He's like that cause I'm pretty sure he was the Basil that was killed multiple times in base game blackspace, which traumatized him. If you don't like him thats fine cause hes a minor character and only has a lot of dialogue if you choose to talk to him. Also, the game has fully released! The demo came out about 5 months ago, and the full game has recently came out, a full on good ending, secret ending, like 50 badges. There are side mods building onto this story by the same dev that are currently in development though. . 
Yeahh, there's ALOT of dialogue. I just didn't like how it leaves no room for interpretation. Just straight up explaining. . Less is more but that's just me ig
Good luck 
Thanks 

Yippee. . 
He's gonna make me cry too :'(
Yippe!! 
get real
Here's every mod that makes the game harder I can find:. . [ - Makes nothing award EXP. Everything except the Boss Rush is doable, but if you try this I highly recommend getting the Chicken Ball as soon as it's obtainable.  . [ - Makes every enemy/boss act twice per turn  . [ - Has various difficulty options and includes a new boss that's only fightable with the hardest difficulty settings. Perfectheart is doable with the hardest settings but you may need a guide for beating her.  . [ - Rebalances the whole game to be harder, adds new skills, and adds new gimmicks, AI, and skills for most of the bosses.  . [ - Limited item stacks, taking high damage inflicts Afraid, QTEs for attacks, and more expensive follow ups  . [ - Makes all enemies/bosses have more heart and juice, with options for x1.5, x2, and x3  . [ - Rebalances the whole game to be harder, new AI and skills for every enemy/boss, new bosses, new charms, a new Basil route available from the Hikikomori route, visible enemy stats, a reworked buff/debuff system, an expanded boss rush, and modified versions of the console-exclusive content.
Wow you’re a boss bro
ty omg
poor hs basil man, and the rest of the headspace friends too
*Refrain from corrupting the morals of our beloved Basil, here's a recovery key if necessary.* . . . . This one has Two TeraBasils!
i drank mine in basil cosplay and didnt die, looks like grimace doesnt mind a basil 
3 days
uh oh 
So people handle tragedy and death differently what a fucking surprise. Him not talking through the game but basil doing so? Gee it's almost like...two different people handling trauma differently.. . Your last point doesn't make sense. Just because he doesn't talk doesn't devalue the character development he had as a whole. I'll also point out a point in the game that proves my point about he retreating so much into his shell that he stopped bothering to talk. How about the tragedy that is the main focal point of omori? Ah yes the shy kid suddenly becoming even less willing to talk to others after he experienced something horrifying to the point where he has retreated into his head so much he barely cares for himself.  And you're telling me that "He's only shy, there's no reason at all for him to do such a thing"? My dude...you clearly missed the context
basil goin insane after a traumatic incident doesnt mean hes gay
Gay means Happy. . This means Basil is NEVER Gay. . Basil lives in a state of constant anxiety, misery, and pain
Trueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
based
No, no. He's got a point
in wwii it was the other way around tho

This is what happens when people take sexuality too seriously. In most games, a character's sexuality is usually the least defining part of their character, and Basil is the same
i’ve started taking the opposite stance and saying everyone is gay/ trans EXCEPT the obvious one. basil is the only cishet in the game now out of spite
Remember, best Basil ship is Basil x Therapy
None of the characters have confirmed sexualities, including Basil, so it’s really up to interpretation. Basil could be straight, gay, bisexual, ace, etc. . . Until Omocat says otherwise it’s down to what you see in each character.
I agree with what they said about feminine≠gay but at the same time I dislike (in all media) that if it’s not stated for some reason characters default to straight. If we’re being real it’s just as much a head cannon that basil is straight or any other sexuality. Are there little snippets that may suggest one way or another? Sure. Does this confirm basils sexuality? No. The only thing that does that is direct confirmation from omocat. Ig it’s just me but it’s nice to have a character that has an unstated sexuality be considered just that, unstated. And it goes both ways. Straight shouldn’t be the default for unstated characters and it should be recognized that it is equally possible they’re a different sexuality.. . TLDR: Basil is an unconfirmed sexuality. If you see that as straight, cool! If you see that as gay, also cool! Neither is “correct” and are both headcannons/speculation.
i agree. i never see this discourse when a character is automatically seen as straight because obviously being straight is still seen as the norm, with straight people being the majority and all. i don’t think most of the conflict comes from “homophobia” or “fetishization”, it’s more that people don’t realize that they’re reacting to specifically this case because defaulting characters to gay is just not as normalized (not saying either should be, i like the idea of keeping it unstated).. . plus, either way, don’t push your hcs on others and don’t shut down others hcs because you don’t like them. live and let live, imo. it isn’t harming anyone.
I completely agree with you, if unstated it should be canonically unstated. If you headcanon a certain view that’s cool too. I definitely think there are certain lines and this game is obviously has a bit more discourse as they are children after all. But it should be said that your headcanon is just that! Your headcanon. If you compile all headcanons of course they will conflict but your headcanon is it’s own separate idea from anyone else’s.
Yeah, that’s not the point, I mean people force their canons into people, claiming it as canon, if you wanna headcanon basil as gay, then do that! Nobody gives a shit!(except the people who do, but they can go fuck themselves) the problem comes when you force it onto the canon and force it onto him just because of his connection to sunny, God.
Because everyone’s fucking forcing it onto him and some people are literally acting like it’s canon, they act like it’s part of his character when it was never even implied. Normally I wouldn’t care about someone headcanoning a character to be gay but seeing everyone force a sexuality on someone just because of their personality gets to be too much to the point where I just want everyone to shut the fuck up about gay basil, I’m sorry, but it’s fucking everywhere
Sunburn and sunflower get like, the same amount of art too. people are just annoyed that basil is gay because he doesn't get shipped with any other character... Except... where are all the people shipping Aubrey and other characters, or kel and other characters? It's just how is is, the story is about sunny and he's the main character so people ship sunny. All the people that complain about shipping basil as gay/bi/pan are just people who think of straight as the default option. And I'm not talking about people who hate the shipping in general, y'all got your reasons and they valid, I'm talking about those who have a problem specifically with basil being gay.
yes and? he could be straight, he could also be gay. as long as you're not being an asshole about other people's headcanons, Basil can be gay all the way
If I can’t be gay for Basil I’m going to disguise myself as a plant then he’ll love me
I must agree. There is nothing saying that basil is actually gay. He is dreamsexual (I’m sorry)
basically every time i’ve seen someone in a fandom claim a character is a certain sexuality that wasn’t confirmed canon and claim it as canon they are joking or just generally not taking themselves too seriously. only time i’ve seen someone mad over sexuality headcanons it has been in direct relation to ship wars, is that what it was? cause in that case it is understandable, ship wars can get unnecessarily intense, no doubt in my mind there has been at least one instance of a basilxsunny shipper harassing a basilxaubrey shipper and viceversa. but if it was just someone joking that basil is “canonically” gay then the comment is overreacting
ship wars i get but i have a hard time imagining anyone going “basil is gay canon” completely unrelated to ships and taking themselves 100% seriously or genuinely believing themselves to be an authority over this
It’s prolly do to people seeing a boy who is gentle, likes flowers, and is kind and thinking “boy = feminine, feminine = gay, boy = gay”
well he could be. gentle gay boys and gente straight boys both exist. don’t see how either headcanon would be bad
Not saying either is bad, but people forget that soft and gentle doesn’t mean gay and doesn’t mean straight. It means that they’re soft and gentle.
glad we agree that he could be any sexuality
Yeah
Can I ask you a question?. Is Basil gay a meme or a little thought shared by (not all) the fandom? I took it as a meme also because, if that were the case, I would find this decontextualized from the rest of the game, (not that it can't fit, but ...) also because there is actually no proof his character is kindly, shy, selfless, etc. I think it's more of a stereotype (don't ask me which one, once on a post I said "sissy" [not for offensive purposes] and they bombed me).. . Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against homosexuality (or even the other types [bisexuality, lesbian, etc.]).
Judging by things like AO3 fanfics, at least a considerable portion of the community headcanons basil as gay (not a majority).
I mean I dont think basil is gay. He's just to busy with his plants to care about romance of any sort
I never took basil as being gay canon, l just accepted it as a meme lol
I think the problem some people have with people saying basil is gay is because it plays into the gay stereotype of gay=feminine, gentle, kind. Personally, I don’t really care about headcanoning basil as gay. I only start to care a bit with sunflower, since that relationship is pretty unhealthy.
Everyone in this thread is a fucking idiot, Basil is OBVIOUSLY a plantsexual!
But in all seriousness, I think Basil is asexual and I am suprised that I haven't seen anybody on Reddit, Discord, Twitter, or Instagram think of him as being asexual. People always either think he's straight or he's gay.
Again that's what I (the original comment) was talking about, you now stereotype his as asexual because he's depressed and doesn't talk to anyone.
who says this ship specifically is sexual to them? just because they look at nsfw material doesn’t mean everything they ship has a sexual purpose behind it.. . i mean, unless they’ve promoted sexual content of these two before. i don’t want to look for it so i won’t. if they have, do correct me lol.. . edit: i was really fucking wrong i think i found it. yeah, they are sexualizing minors. basil too. very explicitly. literally just ignore this comment at this point.
Honestly it seems like this guy is into male-focused Shota stuff, which is uh… yikes.
This was more based off of the idea that just because basil is feminine people think that must mean he's gay. That line of thinking is harmful because in reality there are many feminine men of other sexualities. Headcanons are fine but its not right to assume someones gay just because they are feminine.
The guy you're arguing with is a nonce who posts NSFW content of children characters, some of which includes Basil.. . . No point trying to talk sense into this guy.
Who cares? Let people headcanon Basil as whatever.
I don't think basil's gay because he's feminine.. . I think basil's gay because he's clearly in love with Sunny. Different things
Yeah I kind of hate the fact that people make Basil's entire personality based on gay . There's no confirmed sexuality for Basil so people can ship him with whoever they want as long as it's legal and they don't enforce their opinion on other people
stranger does say that "it's hard [for basil] to think straight" and while it could mean basil >!can't take mari's framed suicide out of his head!<, i'll always interpret it as basil thinking gay instead
Basil is gay, it just doesn't have anything to do with him begin feminine
Any Proof?
No, you thought i was talking seriously?
Sounds like you saw how much you were being downvoted and went “it’s just a prank bro”
I agree, however, Basil does have some evidence on being gay. I think the other way is more accurate. Basil being gay doesn't mean he is feminine. I don't understand why people keep making him a girl with a dick. It is pretty annoying if you ask me.. . Also I am not saying that Basil being gay IS canon, what I am saying is that he does show some coding on it.
Exactly and it's not even Canon that Basil is gay, he's just a femboy
1. it isn’t cannon that he’s straight either, he doesn’t have a set sexuality . 2. Liking flowers doesn’t make you a femboy
HOW DONT YOU KNOW ORANGE CHOCOLATE?? GO GET SOME AND TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK BECAUSE ITS LIKE BASIL, YOU EITHER LOVE IT OR HATE IT SO MUCH THAT IT NEEDS TO FALL INTO A PILE OF SLIGHTLY SOGGY AUTUMN LEAVES
Do you mean cilantro? I've literally never heard this with basil.
Basil, what subreddit are we on.
Cilantro was my favorite omori character
THERE'S ALSO MINT CHOCOLATE AND IT'S SPECIFIC AF
Is it chocolate or mint or both?
it's like chocolate with mint cream(?) layer or with little pieces of mint candy blended in
I feel like this is a wooosh moment but the joke im making is semi obscure so it probably isn't appropriate, but if you know, you know
100%?. . *meanwhile I'm hiding the horde of basil plushies I have behind my back*
You have an obsession with me. Get help.
Tell that to half of r/OMOR. . Also out of context but I genuinely need professional help but mental health is so stupid here that all I have is the guidance counselor and my friends 
Oh, hey there! You need a hug?
. . >You have an obsession with me. Get help.. . Booo,therapy is for losers,i pefer to stay inside and rot away while doing nothing significant with my life.

I hope you know how to swim, basil.... . because you're in denial
Well the first (chronologically) one was >!a moment of intense stress, where he was fully convinced that he'd never see his best friend again if he didn't. I think the stress had more to do with it than any obsession. !<and the >!4 years!< was just >!sunk cost fallacy. He made a monstrously stupid decision that he now regretted, and didn't want the whole thing to become the pointless tragedy that it was, so he kept covering things up for Sunny just so there'd be a reason for his actions.!<. . Or at least that's how *I* explain his actions. I really don't think Basil's all that obsessed throughout OMORI, though I do find the idea of *what if* Basil was obsessed to make for compelling fanworks.
Basil come with me I, Vegito will train you to lean ultra ego!
: Basil you know what we are doing today?. . : W-Wha-. . : Today we are doing an I-N-T-E-R-V-E-N-T-I-O-N!. . : Basil you have a problem... but we are here to help you. And the first step is to admit it.. . : Wait b-but guy-. . : It's true Basil, you have. ~~You also stole my Sunny plush you asshole.~~. . : You have so many Sunny photos Basil! I've never seen this ones before!. . : Wait...is that Sunny taking a bath?. . : ... (is sleeping). . : No but... >!Mari how are you even here? !<. . 
: God sent me for your sins
: Oh no...
: oh yes..
 I have a good reason to believe that this will escalate quickly.

mfw omori fans can't stop making these kinds a comments ☠️ (it happens to every rpgmaker game)

Someone better turn these roleplay comments into comics

What makes this image funnier is the logical implication that Omori merch doesn't exist in the Omori universe, meaning Basil made all those Sunny plushies himself.
Me too tbh

Feels like a repost.. . Actually is one.

Gross.
this is like…very weird ngl ⁉️
OMG Yukkuri OMORI!

Accurate enough
Yeah, you guys need to stop

IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ME! NOT HIM, MEEEEEEEEEEEE!
ITS JUST NOT FAIR
BASIL WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE BODY PILLOW?
is basil gay btw?
i don’t think it’s confirmed but most people think he is
The fact that the entire Fandom assumed Basil's gay just because he's shy and likes gardening/taking photos is both funny and sad
yeah lol I was watching someone stream omori and immediately when we saw rw basil he said “is it just me or is basil gay”
...you know what, sure, I'll put this in my headcanon
omg this drawing looks so good
Ok that’s it I’m gonna start posting random Pinterest stuff too y’all better watch out

I really hate this post for some reason.. . Probably because it's a repost with 3k upvotes, and achieving said upvotes is very difficult in the subreddit.

"Eh i don't need the physical". *sees basil picture*. "RIP My wallet"
Hmm interesting that theyre calling attention to that Basil and Omori tag . Hmmmmmmm
No… NO! Bad shipper no.
Is it shipping or is it Blatant? I think the devs know what theyre doing.
Ok no but listen listen… it’s headspace basil and omori hinting that ship is only HEADCANNON!
You mean like the muliple times Omori and Basil are holding hands
Honestly I agree. Sunny definitely doesn't have a crush on basil at all, but basil himself on the other had could be seen to have one
>Sure you can be like, thats just a friend hand hold but i think switch it with Aubrey and everyones saying its a confirmed ship.. . Eh, I wouldn't think so "by default" myself-- but that's just me! I'm sure there's a lot of people who would  And you're definitely not wrong that they're a lot more cuddly in some of the new art.. . I think my biggest confusion with the whole "well these are Headspace characters, so why would Sunny's dreams include holding hands with Basil if it didn't mean anything?" concept is, well... there's also the Aubrey School area, in Black Space 2. Not to mention her follow-up with Omori, etc... Would that imply that he has conflicting feelings he's indecisive about?. . And the Headspace version of Basil is based off of his "good" qualities (as opposed to Stranger), when they were both 12 & under... Some children just feel a sense of *safety* from holding hands, especially in public. Sure, maybe 12 is "too old" for that for most kids, but it does seem like they met at least a few years prior-- and it's not like Basil's parents have provided him much stability in that sense  Maybe it was just a habit of his that helped him feel less shy & anxious.. . That's pure speculation on my part though; I'm just enjoying the discussion  You've made some good points!
Idk, people hung and hold hands without necessarily being romantically interested in each other, and basil seems like the kinda person who is a handholdy, hugy kinda person. >!That’s not to say that it’s impossible that basil has feeling for sunny, it is certainly an interpretation that could be drawn without really any logic leaps, even though it’s not hinted to in any way I can notice other than basils rather unhealthy attachment issues (and I say that in the nicest way basil, you need help my dude). However even if basil does have feelings for sunny, I think it would be a one sided thing. Sunny did just leave him to deal with Aubrey and his issues alone for 4 years (granted he had many many issues of his own going on and after what happened I can’t really be mad over it), and also considering basil gets banished to torture land in headspace, I feel sunny feelings towards basil by the time of the start game are very conflicted, which makes sense considering everything that happened. Though the post good ending cutscene if you water the plants gives me hope they become best friends again (after therapy of course , those bois need help)!<
If we saw him being so handsy with others than id give you it but we only see him hugging or holding hands with Sunny. Also in the pictures he almost always brings up sunny, with wanting for him to snuggle with his stuffed pets in his bed, granted he was with everyone else but he said wanted to stay there. He said they hang out together all the time, and that he loved that Sunny picked up his book. Im pretty ceratin theres feelings with Basil. . . Regarding Sunny, i do think theres reciprocation. So all of Dream Basils actions are ones that Sunny makes, so the hand holding is one that Sunny is making happen, like he did with Aubrey being so coocoo for him. Plus in the release power animation hes grabbing Basils hand as well. . . Sunny was never running from Basil, he was running from Something. Thats why we were able to jump into the pool after Basil until Something attacked us. Thats why we were able to go into Basils room both times but it wasnt until Something came out and then we were scared off. Idk. Plus going down memory lane, one of the memories Is Basils birthday. Its stated the in the flashback that Sunny is basically only looking at Basil and when you look back the only thing said is "You remember Basil's smile". Its possible this is friendly but idk i think combining everything its much more. . Also one of the times we see them hold hands is in Omori/Sunnys sketchbook in black space. I believe most people believe black space is an area where repressed memories are so i think its possible he repressed the memory of him liking him idk. . . Also he never sent Basil away because no reason, he alwayd sent basil away cause basil always found out the truth. His headspace erases the truth, not basil.
I hear what youre saying but imo put a scene where Aubrey holds Omoris hand and people would be screaming its romantic. Idk i think they intentionally made the tag where all Aubrey gets is a high five and her standing next to him, while Basil gets a whole ass hand hold, which is not common for kids to do unless its romantic, and a whole ass hug. Plus Basil gets a whole ass house and huge garden in headspace while the other guys get literally nothing. Kel gets a pet rock, thats about it. . . I think its proven that Basil is the most important person in Sunnys life, i really dont think thats up for debate and then you add in hand holding and i think it all adds up. I think people saying its a platonic handholding are kinda making excuses imo
At the end of the day, as I have said before, it’s all up to interpretation. Personally the “heart of the forest” thing seems a stretch, calling a place “the heat of” something is a common way to say middle, and geographically speaking basils house is, roughly speaking, in the middle of the vast forest.. . Also, coming back to the basils house existing thing, I’ve been doing some thinking, so hear me out here >!The locations in the vast forest seem to roughly correlate to areas where sunny and the gang hung out a lot when things were good. Neighbours room is the treehouse (all the items in there correlate 1:1 with items we see in the irl treehouse), the beach area is the beach they would all go to play on during the summer, the park is the park (wow great detective work there from me I know), basils house and garden is there because they would often go to basils to see new plants he was growing and stuff (as seen in the photo album), and the pinwheel forest exits because the forested area around the secret lake where they all put pinwheels. We don’t see kel and hero’s home as, judging by the photo album, they would generally come to sunnys home not the other way around, and for Aubrey, they straight up say in the game that they have never actually been to her house before (abusive parents will do that I guess)!<. . As for the holding hand and hugging thing, I’ve already said my thoughts on that, I feel it’s an inconclusive thing though I do think it’s kinda funny that in that release energy basil seems considerably more happy about it than Omori (not that Omori shows much emotion in general). . My overall thoughts on the matter is that >!unlike with sunnys feeling for Aubrey which are outright stated, basils feelings for sunny and any potential reciprocation of those feelings (if they even exist in the first place) are left as a maybe. There isn’t anything that, for me anyway, is enough to go “yep they definitely exist”, but I equally can’t really think of anything which could definitely disprove them ether. The only thing I could think of is that Basil did tease sunny over his crush on Aubrey, which kinda seems an odd thing to do if you also have feeling for that person, but as I said before that’s not necessarily enough to say said feeling aren’t possibly there.!<
While it is the middle of the forest making it tbe heart to me i think is something that just keeps adding. . . And i can agree to an extent, yeah they do kinda call to attention to the fact they havent seen her house. I saw that more as just like this feeds into her troubled and tragic past. Like i think they have been to Kels house before but i also think that Sunny going to Basils house irl a lot also kinda helps my point like, his house was the only other one hed really go to so his mind has that good. . . Yeah idk i guess well just have to agree to disagree to the holding hand thing i just so fundamentally do not see it as just a friendly thing. And again at least its an action hes doing, hes actively grabbing basils hand. The other release energy is just jumping in the air. And to me the fact that they are adding this after a couple years of people speculating while giving Aubrey and Sunny/Omori nothing else new, say something. Tbf if they gave them a kiss animation id expect people to go "yeah friends kiss each other all the time. Totally plutonic". . And listen i do understand those point like Sunny undoubtly had a crush on Aubrey, its proven but i just dont think it lasted and tbf its only like 2 scenes, maybe 3 that are proof when i think theres just more with Basil idk. Theyre less conclusive but i think add up way more. Cause theres still more moments i still havent mentioned.
Sorry for the late reply, I was sleeping. While I do kinda feel this conversation is going nowhere, I’m finding it kinda interesting seeing such an apposing viewpoint, so I’ll just like address what you’ve said here and you don’t necessarily need to reply if you don’t want to.. . - on the house thing, you seem to be convinced that sunny went over there a lot **alone**. Aka, just him and basil hanging out by themselves. Unless I’m missing something big, there isn’t anything in game to support this. In all the photos we see them hanging out as one big group, this includes when at basils house.. . - one final observation on the hand holding thing, it seems to be mostly a headspace basil thing, which is interesting. All the headspace characters are exaggerations of their 12 year old IRL versions, almost to the point of caricature. Hero’s perfectness is way over the top, Aubrey’s hot headedness, kel being hyper and intentionally annoying, Mari being this perfect older sister character. Basil has had many qualities exaggerated for headspace as well, as we can see when comparing headspace basil to flashback basil. Headspace basil is considerably more timid and ‘soft’ than irl basil, and is also more into plants and photography that real world basil was. I feel headspace basil is also more touchy feely than irl basil was. We see a few real world incidents where basil grabs sunnys hand, and one hug, that was not even real and was part of sunny and basil “making up” and being friends again while sunny was blacked out. It’s likely that basil did have a habit of occasionally holding sunnys hand or something, sunny noticed this as it was something unique to basil, so when he made headspace that trait was turned up to 11 along with the rest of the characters characteristics.. . - for the crush on Aubrey, I feel it is still a thing / lasted well into sunny being a shut in. Basil only had the camera for about a year before the incident. We know this because we see 1 Christmas and 1 summer holiday. In memory lane we revisit each of these moments, and it’s in one of these that basil teases sunny about his crush. From this we know that in the year running up to the incident sunny felt this way for Aubrey. Then there is headspace itself. This only came into existence after the incident when sunny became a shut in. As a part of making this world “perfect” sunny went out of his way to give Aubrey a massive and obvious crush on him/Omori. This can be seen via multiple of grape edition Aubrey’s dialog, their follow up together, the weird black space room (which I think likely was a weird daydream sunny had or something that he then tried to forget), along with various other smaller things in headspace that all seem to try and make headspaces Aubrey’s opinion of Omori very clear. It would be pretty weird of sunny to give these traits to Aubrey if he no longer had a crush on her, particularly if he now felt that way towards a different friend. If he had a crush on basil would he not have given basil the super obvious school girl style crush? Then we come to the real world. Sunny isn’t exactly the most expressive guy around, and more than that we don’t get to literally see inside his head during the real world section like we do in the headspace part so it’s hard to really gage what sunny is feeling in the real world. Looking at all of this as a whole, the only real time sunnys feelings could really change towards him crushing on basil would be **while** he is a shut in, which considering he literally stays home and doesn’t see the real basil for 4 years and also this being after the incident, I doubt. As I have been saying throughout this, it’s not impossible, and everyone likely has their own interpretations, however personally even though I think it’s a cute ship, I can’t see it.
One thing worth mentioning is that in the >!final duet!< cutscene Basil is seen holding Aubrey's hand.
Again,i think he said that because orginal arguement used headspace basil and omori to support a claim so orginal user used a more obivious claim to disprove it(i think). . Why dıd you reply to me? İ wasnt even in the arguement 
Oh, sorry, I must've not paid enough attention. Sorry about mistakingly replying to you too
"OMORI is the only one who can reach the (third?) stage of EMOTIONS". . Basil: Am I a joke to you?
Yeah manic, miserable, and furious are all exclusive to him
>!Not in Hikki route!<
Well yeah but in a “normal” play through
Do all of them come with the basil pic or is it randomized
Only got one but I’m guessing… a very big guess… that it’s only basil as you can’t tag him in normally for… various reasons
 I find it odd that it says that Omori likes Basil despite him clearly not during their time in blackspace.
>!I guess omori likes basil personally but also has a job to do, which is to keep sunny from the truth and basil sort of is the truth!<
İ think İts the opposite he is happy with his friends but with basil he doesnt even force a smile and since >!omori hates sunny,he would hate basil too!< but has to keep hım since normalacy needs to be preserved
Omori likes all his friends… I guess
I think it would go more like . . . “I love you omori”. . . “Yes”
**I accidentally read "Basil hanged you" instead of "Basil tagged you" lmfao**

I need one so bad!

Do you guys read it as Ba-zil or as Bay-zil
Thought this said 18th birthday and got scared for a moment.
i love that new art so much he looks so beautiful aaaa 
do we celebrate killing himself as well?
I can tolerate him for today, just because it’s his birthday
so Basil, how was the tree
Basil having a gun is a subtle reference by the developer to the fact that he lives in America
[british basil]()
So you're saying that in the ending where you >!go to sleep at basils instead of confronting him, the reason why they are outside of his bedroom is tied to an older version of the ending? That seems like a stretch!<
Imagine the Basil fight with the gun.
Sunny, announcing his departure: it's not what it looks like!. . Basil With A Fucking Gun: I won't hesitate bitch!
I'm no American either, but a gun being involved would make the story a lot weirder (no offense to Americans). It will raise questions on how Basil was able to obtain a gun, Polly may accidentally be portrayed as a bad caretaker.
>Polly may accidentally be portrayed as a bad caretaker.. . I have a better scenario in mind.... .  "Grandma why are you giving me a Glock?! you're literally dying!". . "Conquer your enemies,destroy those who stand in your way,become the new god of war my sweetie...". .  "Grandma what the fuck are you talking about?!?"
fuck the pen basil the glock is way stronger lmao
Polly: shit she took the weed
 "Wake the fuck up, plant boy, we got a town to burn"
Yeah I’m American, it would 100% bring into question the responsibility of adults or paint Faraway as a place where gun shop owners would give someone like Basil a gun…
Unless Basil’s 21- they’re not going to give a child a gun in fear of losing their FFL. . He’d have to steal it or get it from a shady dealer for it to happen
Hence why I think it’d tarnish Faraway as a shady place
I actually am american, and I agree! . Owning a gun is actually pretty uncommon over here, especially in certain parts of the country, so it would be weird for Basil to have access to one when neither Polly nor his grandmother are characterized as the type of people to own something like that
Not owning a gun is pretty uncommon in certain parts of the country too.
But think about it like this.... . 🔫🥯. . ... it's a bagel...with a gun.... . #**IT'S A BAGEL,WITH A GUN.**
TOMSKAAAAAAAAAAA
While this would be way more fucked up, I'm more interested in how Basil, a 16-year-old child got his hands on a motherfucking Glock.
Its america ive seen fucking 12 year olds at the gun store
You can only legally own a firearm at 18 and only legally own a pistol at 21, the only way hes getting one is by stealing it or somehow going through some shady dealer without an FFL
To own guns, those kids who had lever actions or .44 were probably bought buy their parents. I am well aware that some younger people have easy access to firearms- but I was more going against the OG commenters assertion that a 12 year old can just go to a gun store and ask for a firearm and get it
Still can't get one
Yeah, a gun store is fine for browsing. They can't purchase anything though. Not until 18 for long guns and ammo and 21 for pistols.
I honestly feel like this would've been way less disturbing. Something about the fact that basil was just so fucked up during his breakdown to the point where he just grabbed his shears and stabbed himself. He just grabbed whatever he had, and that's more in character for him I feel
For his neutral special, Basil wields a Sig Sauer P320
Fr they got American basil💀
That is really dark, but also where'd basil get a gun
WOAHHHHHHH BASIL MY MAN
There was one version of the story where Basil went to school and told everyone, "I'm sick of y'all and your pumped up kicks, it's Basil'n time bitches!" Then he caused a mass Basiling
I feel like the current version makes more sense. I mean, where would Basil get a gun from?
I was about to say his parents, but doesn't omori take place in some country that's not the United States?
I thought it took place in some kind of American town in 199x
If that's the case, we could easily say Basil got the gun off his parents
so does this mean something would be Basil's persona
now make it in wallpaper engine or basil gets it 🔪
The fact that Basil writes exactly like *two* characters from a show I humanised that ended up looking like Basil before I’d even heard of Omori is absolutely hilarious 😭
BASILs look like a kid who knows how to write in cursive but the rest don't
I have a headcanon that Basil writes in super prettty cursive >!but its messy as hell if he's having a mental breakdown!<
Why the hell I have the same handwriting than Basil
I write like Basil but it's a little messier
Basil's cursive is a lot like mine except it's way more legible.
I almost have the same handwriting as Basil 
Omori's only significantly taller than his friends in this chart. He's also taller than them in the game, but the gap is much closer as you can see in the tag photos and the mirrors, with him only slightly taller than Aubrey and Kel (and Basil being very close to his height).. . As for Hero, we do have evidence that he's also tall in the real world from Basil's photo album, towering over all the younger kids.
and same with Basil :’D
Rw Basil is shorter.
And Omori and Basil are malnourished 
I am barely 5'3 and I am 15 wtf??? Why is basil taller than me lmao???
I really want to punt Basil from Omori to the moon (1,69, nice)
Anyone else wonder why basil and sunny both wear the same same clothes down to the socks and even shoes (except for the color, though basil's is green it's almost black)
how tf is basil taller than me i’m 5’4” at 21 years old
I dont know if this is intentional, but here’s something interesting I noticed. . . If you see the RW parts, you can see that Basil seems distracted. Everyone is looking to the front, but he is instead looking to his left, where there is seemingly nothing. BUT, if you see the HEADSPACE section, you can see that Mari is next to Basil, specifically to **his left.** Which would mean that if Mari is to Basil’s left in the HEADSPACE section, that would mean the she is also next to him in the RW section of this image.. . **Which might explain why he looks so disturbed.**. . You could say he looks distracted… By *something.*
I hate it how im a blonde and im as tall as basil
im in hs and shorter than headspace basil,, T .T
 i am going to use this as a tiktok pfp and go to random ppls tik toks and comment "i hate basil" anyone with me?
Please make a Basil. I would smash the buy now button.
No! He should be >!with his best friend Basil, smiling at each other!!<
She is kind of mean (for example >!shipping Basil x Lake!< ) but she's not evil. Even in the past and the headspace version doesn't play a victim ("oh no, somebody help me!!!") and instead tries to defend by herself.
BASIL AS WASABI
NO LITERALLY
wasabi is shown to be more of the anxious one of the group, that’s why i assigned him basil! :)

Why is this spoiler? The previous comment had way more of a spoiler
i didn't wanna risk it  also, my comment is basically the >!neutral ending.!< while i agree that the original comment had a spoiler, i don't actually think it was bigger than mine due to >!it being in only a small part of the game (well idk if 'small' is the appropriate word for Blackspace but i have no other words for it in this context) and something that every player needs to go through eventually. it is not as major as the ending!<. . sorry if i did not explain it well enough. i am bad at explaining things and don't have english as a first language :'). . (now that i have read through everything, i think i am overthinking the answer. i put a spoiler on my original reply because the reply contained a spoiler and i think op should put a spoiler on their comment too. you're welcome)
Dang ur good at english if it isnt a first language!!!
tysm!!! i didn't know if i was making sense haha. glad to know i am understandable <33
Your English is great, actually! The only change I would make is capitalizing the first letter of each sentence, as well as the word "I." There is some stylistic choice there, but having no capitalization is extremely, extremely informal.
Tysm!! <33 I will keep that in mind. Thank you!
To be fair, English is my first language and i forget to capitalise lmao
Lore accurate. 🍈
You deserve to suffer 🫥

I'm gonna try stitching him together again since i am way wayyy too broke to buy one from a reseller. his body and his face is (mostly) intact, jut the back of his head is wrecked
You should paint the cotton red with black dots so it looks like the inside of a watermelon instead
ahh yk that's not a bad idea. I'm honestly pretty terrible at sewing. If the stitches come loose I might just do that
I'd love to see him have little bandages on his limbs and head. That would be pretty adorable
>! New blackspace death just dropped !<

>it's mentally painful for me, and i'm sure physically painful for basil. .

 'Oh boy, what a nice sleep in at Basils! Why is everyone in the hallway?'
How about Omori juggling dw Basil, rw Basil and Stranger's heads
their earlier work i read came off pretty ableiet to basil for me (ybm/pursuit) did that ever get better in the later stuff they made? edit: like the hyper creepy stalker diary in YBM?????
I also sat “What”
check other reply
What? why do you say that
basically, the narrative has characters like aubrey and hero persecute basil pretty heavily (aubrey talks to hero with disgust about how basil is very obsessed with sunny, as well as some narration judging him for weird and creepy behavior) and basil acts toxically ooc in a way that felt similar to a strawman of ableism for his bpd-coded traits to me.. . also i just remembered doesnt basil have a hyper creepy stalker diary for sunny in YBM what the actual hell????? plus a scene where aubrey confronte basil on faking being timid and the plot treats that as correct?? all entirely wrong
...I mean I have no experience with any of these works so I can't say anything about how well what you just gave me about it correlates with the actual story, but telling by the the downvotes you're getting I think you may be missing something.
cmon, its the reddit mob. basil having a stalker diary for sunny in the game's events is unequivocally bad. im just wondering if they changed
Maybe he truly feels that attached to him to the point where he literally does that stuff
Man could someone give an alternate opinion because I'm only getting info from one side
it feels condescending for you to so easily doubt me and give the downvote mob all the leeway. general omori fans arent gonna be knowledgeable enough for marginalized disorders like bpd to easily identify ableism.. . the core of basil's character is his kind nature contrasted against his insecurities, he has limits. he wouldnt do something so brazenly harmful like that
I mean it is a fanfic, everyone is a bit OOC, Hero kidnapping Sunny is the point I have a harder time believing tbh but again it is fanfic and going in I accept it is unlikely for everyone to be truly in charecter. I don't think you are neccesarily intended to be rooting for any of the characters and I don't think any of them are specifically supposed to be 100% correct in all their actions. As someone who writes, characters are not usually stand ins for the authors true perspective I have written characters that do not have the most flattering views before while simultaneously not condoning said views. In game Aubrey does flip over thinking Basil was the one to scribble out the album and bully the fuck out of him so I could suspension of disbelief see it as it being hard to change habbit of beefing with Basil for years. I am also autistic and I do not remember it reading as ableist to me but everyone is allowed to have their own opinion on it too because evergones experience is unique and has different lines for where their suspension of disbelief breaks.. . It's alright if the work was not for you and you didn't like it or feel it was in character or took too many creative liberties. I also did not particularly love it and I dropped Pursuit because it felt more like it's own thing than Omori, but I respect the work and time it takes to write such a long work.. . Anyway if you have ever seen the Echo or Bad Apple Omori MAPs they were behind hosting those and truly I could not imagine coordinating 50+ animators to create something by a deadline.
Im so shocked i thought her and Basil were first gone for sure
Is Basil sold out?
I bought her at least, and omori and basil (:

I haven't seen active Basil hate here. Most people are either neutral or positive about him.
Yeah there was one time where this subreddit was full of Basil hate posts but not anymore
When I was on my break at the start of the month, I only saw a gif of Basil getting blended and a post that called out Basil haters and Aubrey fans (both posts were in my regular reddit feed). I didn't pay too much attention because I was tired from the subreddit.
I didn't even think of that gif as basil hate at first, thought it was just another random omori shitpost
Oh i see and yeah i also saw the Basil getting blended gif
Even though I think Sunny x Basil is still better, I actually kinda like Kim x Basil lol I don't know why
Basil haters are most likely to come out when you make a post defending Basil. Look at the comment section in my last two posts if you want proof of that.
and theyre always like "am i the only one who actually kind of hates basil? blah blah blah x y z reasons etc etc" like we havent had this conversation 3.6 million times
Not to mention that pretty much all of the reasons basically boil down to “Basil did some bad things so he must be a bad person”.. Prove me wrong.
just because hitler did a few bad things, doesnt mean you can run around saying "i dislike hitler" or "hitler isnt a very good person".
Starting WW2 and committing genocide and ethnic cleansing is more than just “a few bad things”.
Holy fuck, I stay off Reddit for nearly a day... or at least try to and everyone is arguing about Basil, Aubrey, and all the others.. . Wtf have I witnessed?
Yeah, you shouldn't go to these posts' comment sections without a hazmat suit.
I mean, it’s always been like that unfortunately
(Hey, Basil hater here) We have dignity, we stick to our subreddit, r/antibasil and everyone else stays here.
Not everyone apparently, considering some people don't mind their own business and flood our subreddit with probasil content.
Don't you just wanna chuck him into a woodchipper while singing lewd nursery rhymes?
Nah fuck Basil , all my homies hate Basil
[FUCK BASIL  ALL MY HOMIES HATE BASIL ](). . ^^^this ^^^has ^^^been ^^^an ^^^accessibility ^^^service ^^^from ^^^your ^^^friendly ^^^neighborhood ^^^bot
I see more people complaining about basil haters than actual basil haters
im all positive justice for my boy
if they dislike a character for understandable reasons thats one thing, but basil haters in particular seem to ignore that he is a child with no parental support and 386 undiagnosed mental illnesses
I mean. . I would cut all ties if they did what Basil did if someone irl did what he did
by all means it's your personal choice to make, and i wouldn't expect even his friends in the game to forgive him, i just think it should be acknowledged that he's not irredeemable or a monster because of what he did, he needs support and connections to help him heal
>! in response to the people talking about the recital incident.!<. . >!In the truth photo texts in the game files, they never actually say Basil suggested hanging.

This tells us that he isn’t happy with what’s happening either.!<
I am a Basil stan and I hate Basil
He's a little confused
They've got the spirit at least
That's something
Iconic
Basil pulls of a dress better than she does anyway
this is the best comment
Finding out peeps who are Omori fans who hate Basil baffle me. I thought it was a joke considering he’s basically *a key requirement for the game’s narrative to work at all*
I understand why some hate basil, but bro was just being like "nah sunny wouldn't do that" and for some reason didnt call the police, but i still stan basil, basil's just a sad dude that regretted his actions and was left all alone by his best friend.
I understand not liking basil, but I cant understand hating him
Really, why do people hate Basil? He might have covered up manslaughter and all but who hasn't!? /s /s /s
In response to that she was gonna be the murder if hero didn’t save basil, she legit pushed basil to the water when he cannot even swim (since they known each other well enough as kid she probably knew he couldn’t even swim). She didn’t even bring that up or apologize first until kel called her out.
I don't hate Basil
why cant i be excessive? why cant i be passionate?  . . . and again, if it was about basil my point still stands-
excessiveness usually isnt good. the point of calling something excessive is that its over the amount it needs to be.. . And your point literally makes no sense if its about basil and you means sunny. Theyre different people
I love Basil and Aubrey because I relate to both of them a bit to much (especially basil) 
Wait, why is basil receiving so much hate? It's right he did wrong stuff but his intentions where KINDA pure.
Ye i was the same! I totally thought it was satire but it just kinda went over my head-. . They hate him because >!he tampered with Mari's corpse and because he like cut Sunny's eye.!<. . This is totally my interpretation but I never saw Basil as >!malicious or meaning to traumatise or harm anyone in that situation, whereas Aubrey in my opinion always had a bad intent with her actions, and was also a lot older than Basil at the time of each characters major flawed action(s).!<. . Also I think the final encounter with Basil where >!Sunny gets gouged!< it a pretty interesting scene that cant be dictated as either good or bad on either characters part- So I don't get why people only hate on Basil when Sunny was also apart of the conflict right?
I never figured it out so can someone tell me why people hate basil.
As a Basil stan i still love Aubey But i hate Aubrey stan who hate Basil
what’s with the omori fandom and trying to find a character in the main cast to hate???? as a huge basil fan I do sorta understand why some people dislike basil’s actions but still, none of these characters deserve hate
I fit this mold but the only reason I dislike basil is because his limited family didn’t continue with the damn seasoning puns!
valid!
I dislike basil because out of the 5 major characters, he’s the weakest in the story developed
i get that tbh. All the others go through a LOT of character development. But to be fair i think the whole point is they all handle their grief differently. Basil just seems to become very quiet and reserved which isn't helped by Aubrey bullying him for years either. The point is he's so meek and hides out at home most of the time.
That bit is ok, how they handle it. What I’m talking about is close to endgame, when >! The incident!< That, it feels like, was slapped in late, which is the major cause of why I feel he’s not very strong as a character, which is a shame because I feel with more development, he would have been somewhere in the mid pack.
i do also kinda agree. it was fairly sudden. that whole basil lategame stuff blends together for me and i honestly forget where it takes place
i respect this so much!!!
I just "hate" basil cause its fun to bully him, he looks very bulliable
I barely see any basil hate posts and if I do, they will get destroyed🪚
there's no evidence what she would have done in that situation because she wasn't in that situation. And again there's still nothing canon pinpointing that entire idea solely on basil
I would say never staging a suicide is pretty good proof that she would never do it. I mean, staging a suicide is not something that people just do, right?
ok nevermind then
I like all OMORI characters they all have trauma and also I’m basil kin
Basil almost kills Sunny and hanged Mari's body, the double standards lol. I think Basil is the last one to be forgiven.
True, the somethings don't go away. But Basil thinks is the only way to get rid of it, that's why he kills himself (plus the bullying and his grandma dying). . . Yes, Basil did it to protect Sunny and feels extremely guilty by it. But he still believes until the end that he did the right thing (and that it was the only option in that scenario) by hanging Mari's body.
why do people hate basil tho? i'm not totally partaking in the fandom and i'm looking for some insights
Me, who doesn't hate basil because I like Aubrey, but hates basil because of monika vibes
i think if you beat the game you should know why people hate basil
I have actually 100% the game, achievements and all!  . I know why people hate basil and they are allowed to hate him, but, those same people tend to excuse all of aubreys actions and dont treat her to the same level of criticism.
At least Basil didn't steal or try to drown someone
I don't mean that way, she literally pushed Basil onto the lake and almost drowned both Sunny AND Basil, if Hero wasn't there both of them would have drowned
Tbh lot of the hate for Aubrey is unwarranted. No one deserves hate, they are just kids after all. Aubrey's actions make a lot of sense too because.. . &#x200B;. . \-She didn't know Sunny scribbled the photos of Mari, so she uses instinct and assumes it was Basil.. . \-She makes fun of Sunny being 'in his own little bubble' probably due to being startled and confused at his sudden arrival.. . \-Her home life is shit due to her parent's divorce, and her mother just outright neglecting her and leaving her in an awful and rotten home.. . \-Became a delinquent due to her selfishness in not being there for Kel or the others and uses that projection to spite Basil for years.. . \-She pushes Basil because of her temper, anger, and (fake) resentment pre-truth.. . &#x200B;. . Honestly, the list goes on that she's emotionally fucked up let alone always wanting to be with others, she never got the love as a kid until she met the friend group, which makes her story even more scarce and sadistic in a way because at the end of the day she deeply cares for everyone but due to prior events her emotions are all over the place.
Thanks for the analysis, I agree a lot. (OP don't crucify me) :(((
how did you know. . . fuck basil all my homies hate basil
If people don’t like Basil, they don’t like me. Cause I’m nearly the same. Except I don’t cry. That parts broken
i hate basil because he is basil
i hate basil.. . (dont read my flair)
That doesn't mean you can say she deserves to be hated just because you yourself hate her. Other people have opinions too, and "Deserved Aubrey hate" isn't any more real than "Deserved Basil hate". (I actually like Basil, I'm just making a point.)
yes other people can have opinions. and mine is that any hate aubrey gets is deserved. not saying anyone has to hate her, just saying that if they do, i \*feel\* it is justified (a sentiment which I dont carry for basil hate). again, this is really all my opinion
Fair enough.
No way Basil Omori IRL????😳😳😳😳😳
Omg babil² 😳
You mean 'Basil²' ? 
Brasil
Since I live in Singapore, if you need a jump rope for *certain purposes* tell me and I'll be there in a jiffy.
This could be easily be taken out of context or misunderstood
Yeah, you might think they want to use it for >!actual jumprope!<!












Two Basils are better than one. Now we can all be happy and see the bright side of things.
2 babil is better than one >!double the dededepression!<
I love how it's both the real world Basil, and dream world Basil
AAAAAAAAH I WANT TO HUG THEM >:3
the fact that a girl looks convincing dressed as Basil says a lot about him
They both did such a great job
Dream Basil has escaped Headspace and became friends with the real Basil.
Shit, They're multiplying
DOUBLE BASIL DOUBLE BASIL
Damn so they both are murders. Wait?! What did YOU do?!
I can finally fight basil irl
BABSIL RE AL LIFE AAHAHHSHDHCHCHCNSNDNDJWIEICMCNFNFF
Basil is gae. . Now kel drinks orange joe
Babil and Babil :D
I love it


Yo, those cosplays are so good!
Omori will be real in 15 minutes
The basilverse expands
I have basil related dysphoria that i will never look as basil as basil does and here are two people that are staring me in the face like twisted manglements of my own psyche. Manglement isn't even a word. This is a very uncanny image to me. It's like watching a semi-realized version of what my mind was angry at me for not being, only to realize it's really not what I want, and yet the feeling of inadequacy remains. this image was a weird freudian mind adventure and i greatly doubt i am mentally well
Love how it's real world Basil meeting Headspace Basil too.
Bagels
This is adorable!
I love this  <3
[Welp, you know what they say]()
I LIVE IN MALAYSIA AND I LIKE OM9RI W H A T

No.
Does it really matter? As long as they're having fun, that's all that really matters

oh shit how did I miss this :( i was there and didn't see you guys, would love to take a pic
Damn basil dropping that tactical slur
I don't get my Basil plushy until November 12th.. . But I'm getting mine as a birthday present from a friend, so that's different.
Its just annoying, i and everybody else ordered them like 2 weeks ago *even people who got like every single one have gotten theirs before i have even gotten my ONE plushie* hell i dont even have a delivery date yet, thats still pending apparently
pouting basil
Gimme Basil's story!
[OP edited the comment, it was "Basil's" before]()

warsetdyfugkhyftdrfhgvjjvg basil deserves better than this!!
Fr, like, noo my baby boy why
i agree but also disaggre. like im biased he’s one of my favorites but at the same time he did some questionable stuff (im on mobile reddit i cant do the spoiler thing so ill just leave it as that)
People on mobile can do the >!spoiler!< text. It’s quite easy.
Could you explain how please?
“> ![text]! <“ without the spaces
I feel like that’s countered by the fact that he was still able to smile at basil after he gouged his eye out with gardening shears.
i agree! the picture was meant to represent them during the events of the game and not after
I was basil for Halloween and ony guy recognized me lol. Nice costume
the fact that i went as basil makes this *even worse*
Lost a rap battle against a bunny and basil got thrown in a wood chipper
Damn Omori is a really good Creepypasta game, and im the only one who thinks that Basil remind me of Fluttershy from My Little Pony?
Yess you are right, Omori is kind of like Jeff the Killer XD
this one made my muscles psychically clench up and make me light headed
This one is the most accurate
It hurts how accurate it is
I think my nervous system juat rearranged itself after reading this one
Your brain cells did the harlem shake
Stooooooooooop
💀
lol imagine relating a guy to a horse, Basil is more like Jeff the Killer but better
Bruh out of context this sounds weird but I love it lol 😆
Time to go to black space
the 2012s that were super transphobic/homophobic or no?. . cause im abt to go off abt omoristuck. i lived thru fandom at its worst once i can do it again.. . basil's SUCH a woobie though when he's not causing all the WANK in this fandom orz
omori is clearly a prince of mind and if u dont agree ur wrong :ppp
wait but you actually have a point there
hed be a jade blood too ok hes a maryam with the plants and maybe a daywalker whos been trying to hide it.... . kel would be maybe blue? alongside hero, but they're not actually related so much as they just grew up nearby and became close. they say kel is hero's apprentice or some shit.. . aubrey's probably lower tier bloodrank.. brown maybe? shed have such an interesting personality for a seadweller but the way the town treats her def makes me think to get the equivalent across shed have to be yellow or lower.... . omori imo would be a seadweller or Near It. itd add some different aspects to the Incident, like. - hero feeling inadequate to a seadweller mari, and then felt like it was Inevitable for it to end badly because it was Too Good To Be True. - basil has extreme anxiety because a jade assisting in What Basil Did against a seadweller would spell basil's imminent death. - omori/sunny not knowing how to deal with ANY consequences up to The Incident cause seadweller life made him a lil spoiled n sheltered. - trolls are raised by literal animals but itd **still be more guardians around the kids than in canon**
youre the only person who did this correctly orz
i was, unfortunately, An Adult in 2012.... . i think its just a lot of other users here *weren't* adults in 2012 so they have lil point of reference for how the internet was.
\*draws emo Basil\*
I dunno why but I think Basil gives out major Jonathan Vibes. not jonathan joestar. just. joestar
I kin Basil. Basil is me. No doubles or I'll block you!!!! >:(
I actually considered having Basil's head split open like at the end of the game "The Witch's Isle", with the splatters of "blood" forming a shape resembling Something's eye, but that's way above my skill level.
>the sprite sheet "BS\BASIL" contains some sort of fusion between his real world and Headspace sprites, and an "Omori" version of him? Once again, I don't remember seeing either of these in-game.. . The one that looks like a fusion between his real world and headspace sprites actually is used - [it's the Basil that you talk to in Basil's Meadow]() just before the Truth segment. Pretty sure the black and white Basil is unused though.. . Also, man, that last one with Basil getting possessed looks so sick, I love it!! :O I think if you want to make the legs move as he hovers, you could try moving them separately - like the second one starts moving a couple frames later - which would make it look a bit less like wings. Or you could also just add more spider legs.
You're right. I always thought that was just his regular "Dream World" sprite.. .  Also, thanks for the tip :)
That would be a cool idea for special enemies during the "one day left" section of the alternate route, but I guess it could get boring quickly. There's only so much you can do with "eyes, tentacles, hands and Nondescript Black Slime.". . It does wrap itself around Basil at the end of the game, but that's probably not quite what you mean.
something basil sounds like a cool af bossfight
I just asked her. She said good ending. Saved Basil and didn't kill themselves. . . That sounds good.
\-They didn't kill themselves. . \-Well that sounds good 
Good , good !!. . That sounds very good 👍
>!Actually, I feel like if anyone, Basil might be into that.!<
What? Really?
as a basil kinnie i am scared of you but i love your cosplay sm <3
WHO IS THE PERSON NEXT TO BASIL THO
Good question
Is basil taking a taking a picture of the guy taking a picture
No. It's a POV. You're the one being photographed :)
Oh
so is sunny actually the tallest out of basil and aubrey then. or maybe basil is just hunching
1. If there is a Basil shirt, I don't need my money anyway.. 2. >!Is Basil trying to match Sunny's missing eye with his camera ?!<
Did they even know who Basil was? The trailer shows it pretty vaguely. . . . . Ok... honestly, I admit I would've done the same if I was a shipper because knowing the other characters and knowing that their role is being in a different plain of existence than Omori-boy... seeing this new character, Basil, with a more distinct design than the others, and who seems to have a deeper lore, I would've also thought he and Omori had some kind of important relation
Basil and Sunny are both somewhat inspired by the book *The Picture of Dorian Grey*, and the book is referenced a couple times, one of the most striking pieces is that Basil has his name completely taken and inspired by the character Basil in the book, as well as the fact it is implied in the book that Basil and the protagonist are attracted to each other. Since there are many parallels between Sunny and Basil and the characters in the book, it can be somewhat implied Basil and Sunny might be attracted to each other more than what is there at surface level.
I thought I was headcanoning sunny x basil but then I read the book and now I consider the ship to be implied
Hmmm, >!looks like someone watched Faraway Logs!<
Actually not really, have heard of them though.
Oooo
i assume it’s him pinning a bit of the blame on basil or just raw emotion and intrusive thoughts
I mean I'm pretty sure it's in his deepest thoughts, not to mention sunny acts pretty cold to basil in the normal run >! (Excluding the secret ending) !< either way, basil gets absolutely destroyed in there, like Jesus.
True, but also God damn, >! Homie just left him in the bathroom, like who does that?! !<
he had pizza to deliver he was catching that bag 💯💯💯
Honestly good for him, basil'll be fine, he held off for 3-4 years, what's another 30?
Your post's content violated our spoiler policy. . . Please review our spoiler policy before posting again.
I don't think it's so much that as >!Omori's purpose is to keep the truth repressed, and Basil is the only one who knows the truth, so he's a threat to the world Omori has created. Headspace Basil keeps getting brought back to life with no memory of his previous deaths, so Sunny does want to see him alive and well, but every time Headspace Basil remembers the truth or tries to talk about it he has to be silenced to keep that truth hidden from Sunny.!<
FINALLY, a non horni answer!
Uhm, so, this means that Omori x Basil is canon, but what about Sunny x Basil? 
They were kinda the same person at the time this tweet was posted so
Get Mini Basil'd

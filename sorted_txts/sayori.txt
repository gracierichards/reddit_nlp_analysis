>!"You killed Sayori. She loved you and you killed her."!<  . >!"Yuri loved you and you broke her."!<  . >!"Natsuki loved you and you deleted her."!<  . >!"Protag loved you and you erased him."!<  . >!"Player loved you and you drove them to delete you."!<
You know Monika is thinking it when she has a change of heart, but we know now that extreme guilt isn’t any better than a total lack of remorse!
What if Sayori killed MC by accident instead?. . . Lile Sayori takes Sunny’s role while MC takes Mari’s role.. . After all, MC is clearly Sayori’s Best Friend.
Sayori is so cute wth
>!I mean technically so was Sayori since she's canonically a video game character and can't really be alive.!<
what do you mean my 2d waifu isint real 
Cry about it weeb. . \-
Ok I will. . \-
>!yes!<
Hey, it’s been a moment, does Sayori live in a two story house?
I think so
OH NO OH GOD OH NO OH GO-
Hey sayori can you stand by those stairs for a second?
Aw hell nah, Sayori got pizza’d.
..yeah 
Sayori get the banana
>!Sayori!<, huh?. . Well, honestly, compared to Omori, she actually speaks and has an overall happy tone around her.
She is so good, little goober who just needs a hug 😭
True enough.
Literally didn't say the Name to not spoil lol
Welp, i thought that was common knowledge.. . Editing that now.
Sayori
.... . ...Oh.
See. They always take the hottest ones.
Sayori
foul ☠️☠️
Well both characters like to hang up with their friends a lot
I knew this comment section would hurt me
oh hell nah 😭
They said wrong answers only
You motherfu-
NAWWWW
Sayori?
Dude it's Sayori
Sayori
Sayori who loves to play piano
Sayori
He gently opened the door to Sayori's room
Ofc he did. >!How did you expect him to pick up the rope?!<

its the sayori memes all over again

That must be why! They’re actually Yuri and Sayori! (Hello too! I’m honored to be healed in such high regards. I always love seeing your posts with MS paint too!)
I need OMORI on Steam, it seems the mod community is flourishing without me, and I find that sad :(. . I OF COURSE SUPPORT ALL OF YOUR ENDEAVOURS FOR PROJECT SAYORI
That's the fun part. I could only label it as a mod. But it's a fan game built from the ground up that won't need you to have Omori as the base!
OH MY FUCKING GOD I LOVE YOU
Of course, I'd want anyone to have a chance to experience Project SAYORI. Plus, I'd like to add a few things into the game that even OMORI couldn't have!
>!SAYORI will not succumb!<
So, does that mean MC…
WAO I LOVE THIS IDEA I REALLY REALLY REALLY HOPE IT FULLY COMES OUT SOMEDAY


Oh cool
oh wow this looks interesting
Absolute cinema
is there a discord server for this?
I suppose if there is an audience for it, I'll think about making it.
has an audience arisen?
Ah, that reminds me when someone made a real size Sayori human plush thing.
this is so cool. . is what i would've said if i hadn't seen the human-size-sayori-doll incident
>!They Sayori'd her ass 😔!<
>!aint the purpose of a noose to snap/decapitate? Why they choose the hard way out!<
>! It is the easy way out. Less painfull but these hangings arent enough to snap necks its closer to chokeing you. Youd have to be thrown off a building to have the noose snap your neck and die instantly !<

I'm loving all these Deltarune X Omori memes we've been getting lately.
i would actually love a deltarune and a omori crossover
r/suddenlydeltarune
r/wowthissubexists
DELTARUNEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. . i have no idea wtf Omori is i came here for the deltarune and well yeah
Play it. You would probably like it. This subreddit is full of spoilers, so be careful with that.
uhh is it a horror game? I can like easily get scared of something and immediately dislike it just for that.
I'm a complete coward and I could handle it. The horror sections are short and not that bad. 95% of the game is either wholesome or sad.
does the game cost money
yes
welp cant play cuz my dad got angry for buying minecraft 2-3 years ago. . how come all the good games cost m o n e y
You can always get it by *alternative means* if you know what I mean. But if you can buy it you should absolutely do it, because indie game developers need as much support as they can get.. You can also watch a let's play, but the experience is not quite the same as playing it yourself in my opinion.
You can always watch someone's playthrough on Youtube- thats how I played it!
I am watching Merg's
Hey, so am I!
Yeah, there are lots of great playthroughs out there! I always recommend Barry's (BarryWasStreaming), but NicoB's was pretty great, and Merg is doing one currently that's been fun to watch.
I know this comment is from a year ago but if you have Xbox Game Pass you can get it for free there…if you somehow managed to dodge spoilers for all this time it’s a game you’ll never forget.
Play it, it is so fucking good.
i cant cuz it costs money and my dad got mad for buying Minecraft
I can give you a run down of the game in dms if you want
thanks but no thanks I'd rather play it blind \^\\^
I see, piracy is always an option but I wouldn’t recommend that.. what I will tell you is that it’s horror, most of the jump scares are optional though, the non-optional parts are like- once or twice
I love deltarune X omori content, good shit my man
Deltarune will be here soon
I expected deltarune to be in the top 10
in a previous comment i said that the venn diagram of the deltarune fandom and the omori fandom is a circle. it would appear as if i should add the danganronpa fandom to said circle as well
Hello Jevil from the hit game deltarune
Hello Mautos from the hit invention the internet
Hello Rissif from the hit continent North America
Hello Glaceonboy from the hit game Pokemon Gun Edition
Hello randomhonk29 from the hit game, Amongus
Hello Jevil13 from the hit time, 312 day ago
Deltarune yesterday
Night in the woods. Omori. Deltarune. One shot. . What are the other ones
Remove Deltarune and we'll talk
Is it because it's made in gamemaker? Because it's still an rpgmaker game in spirit.
Because it sucks
Guess you're not a [Big Shot]
???. . What a weird opinion, got any reasons for it?. . Also really funny to imagine someone who thinks Deltarune is bad media but Yiik can stay.
I mean, Omori and Deltarune are pretty similar.
Omori and Deltarune next to the super hardcore heavy rock fast paced action fighter with a story revolving around human bioweapons and a worldwide apocalypse is juxtaposition at it’s finest
I guess deltarune is technically also about a worldwide apocalypse in a way, since the reason you have to seal the dark fountains is to prevent the roaring.
true, but the vibe of the games is definitely different from soundtrack alone
sorry what's bridget's game about?
Guilty Gear, it’s a fighting game like street fighter or mortal kombat. . 
Fighting game. The lore is wild, Japan doesn’t exist anymore, it’s just a hole in the ocean
SORRY???
Are you talking about Bayonetta 3?!
What the fuck
You’ll be here soon
including deltarune
This feels like it could also apply to susie and noelle from deltarune
YES
Ha ha ha ha! This is delicious!
same fnf and roblox and i moved to ultrakill,hollow knight,omori and deltarune
So real
Time to move to the deltarune fandom 💔✌️
real 🥀
Deltarune
reminds of the tea theory from deltarune
It's Deltarune so they take sunlight.
in deltarune chapter 4 >!if you play through it on the weird route, Susie says “like, uh, hey, maybe things took a weird route right now” and it became a meme!<
So there's two memes here? I was more thinking about those, "This truly was our Hikikomori" memes. Those type.
Seam Deltarune!?
Don't forget Deltarune :)
I actually did play Deltarune and really did enjoy it
Not really, hylics was before Deltarune
He be doing the Kris pose from Deltarune.
OMORI X DELTARUNE X MURDER DRONES?!?!??!!
Deltarune X omori when
Exactly, you won't see Susie being that antagonistic in deltarune
what is the third game i know deltarune and omori what is the third one ?
It's from an animated show thing on YT called Murder Drones
Queen from deltarune????
AHHH YESSSSSS
*her theme starts playing*
10 hours of actual gameplay, 6 hours pre stream going over 5 different psychology charts and applying them to the characters 😭 it’s a crazy experience for sure but I can’t wait for him to finish Deltarune
Omori is like kris from deltarune
So basically kris from deltarune but chaotic rather then neutral
Same thing with kris from deltarune lul, on the outside they seem like a chill emotionless kid but if you look at their past they’re a little bitch who pulled pranks and stuff lul (the only reason they act emotionless is because the player is controlling them throughout the game)
What is this, Deltarune?
I'm not going to reply to any other reply with images because of the sheer amount if replys on this post and the r/Deltarune version is overwhelming, I have other things to do (Thanks though for the karma and dopamine flood though!). . 
Ah ok I see, thanks for sending that! I wasn't aware fangamer had deltarune merch. I'll have a look at what they have available and maybe make a purchase.
Honestly, I could make a whole list of similarities between DELTARUNE and OMORI.
Kris deltarune with trauma. This is exactly what my friend expected. Oh god.
IS THAT WHY I FEEL LIKE THE STORY PLOT IN DELTARUNE FEELS THE SAME AS OMORI? WHAT THE SHIT
That explains the few similarities between Omori and Deltarune in terms of thematics
ewwww deltarune?
Did you just post an opinion?. . Hippity-hoppity, your non-existent internet points are no longer your property
are you trying to brag about internet points with only 400 post karma :/
Bragging is not the point of my reply + never even said anything about myself
Patio
Didn't have to do that to the Fun Gang lmao you seem to not like deltarune much. . . . . . . I guess it all depends how certain mechanics translate lmao
Compared to OMORI and friends the Fun Gang are weak
I mean. . . . . . I disagree . . . . . . . . . Since one is real in universe and the other isnt
That is irrelevant to power, no?
yeah, plus omori can kinda just manipulate the world to his will, and uh.... R E D H A N D S . I T H I T S R I G H T  I N T H E H E A R T .. H U M P H R E Y.
which of these groups fought >!a giant fucking robot that's like twice the size of skyscrapers?!<. . also you have to take into account omori is a complete game and deltarune is not, so fun gang might get much stronger enemies in the future. . also if >!noelle was in the mix... well... snograv!<
You have to repost this in r/Deltarune so we can hear their takes, too
I already did 
Oh, nice! It looks like people were much more passionate about the topic here than there
The post is structured in an OMORI-styled battle. If you've played the game, you would know that in OMORI, enemies cannot dodge, attacks can only miss. Despite dodging attacks being a big part of Deltarune, this is an OMORI-style battle, where dodging attacks is impossible.
The Deltarune team is called The Fun Gang? It's been a bit since I've played
You get to choose between The Fun Gang, Lancer Fan Club or, The ?!? Squad
Deltarune gender discourse has poisoned people's brains. Nameable protagonists are a standard feature of JRPGs.
Deltarune is a weird one because you name the vessel, which is then discarded. Kris is called Kris either way. . . Undertale is a better example because you DO name and get called that name, but people don't realise you name the first fallen human, Chara, not Frisk. It's revealed in True Pacifist that Frisk is Frisk, and always *is* Frisk.. . So really, in both of those games, you dont name the protagonist at all. The naming system is just utilised in a less traditional way (and for Save Files)
That wasn't relevant to my point.
wtf else is "deltarune gender discourse" and what does it have to do with Omori's naming system? I explained how the naming systems in deltarune and undertale differ entirely to Omori.
The entire argument over Kris' gender has led to people adopting really weird views on self-insertion, blank slates, and nameable protagonists.
you keep referring to people headcanoning stuff about kris as if it is fact. People can go ahead and have headcanons about the game/kris, but what Ved is saying is you have no control over those elements. You can’t change anything about kris, not even his name. People have been having weird views over self insertion type characters for a long time, deltarune hardly influenced this, moreso tumblr culture did.
Well the fact you referred to Kris as "he" indicates you presumably don't actually disagree with me on what about Kris is canon and what isn't. (Unless you're arguing Kris is canonically male...)
I’m arguing that using deltarune as the example of gender discourse is moot, as people projecting their own canons onto a game doesn’t deliberately mean that the game is the cause of it. That’s semantics lol, you can construe whatever narrative you want at that point.. . edit: spelling
> as people projecting their own canons onto a game doesn’t deliberately mean that the game is the cause of it. . . It's discourse about Deltarune. It's Deltarune discourse. I don't see your point.
you are arguing that deltarune is the sole cause of gender discourse, and I am saying that isn’t lol. To blame 1 game for the faults of players projecting is kind of asinine and uninformed.
> you are arguing that deltarune is the sole cause of gender discourse. . No, I'm blaming the discourse around Deltarune for certain opinions on matters not directly related to gender.
When you want to make your player identify with the character, which is sometimes a good idea and sometimes not.
And then there's deltarune where the backbone plot is Kris trying to be their own character and fight back against the player's control, yet people also think that kid is a self insert character.. . It's the typical fate of the silent protagonists to be labeled self insert characters
Now the final one, amongus + dream + numbert from deltarune
Humprey?
Again… you found it
🤯🤯🤯
I KNEW DELTARUNE'S CHURCH LOOKED FAMILIAR. . 
This but with Ralsei from Deltarune.
They all moved to Deltarune lol
r/deltarune discord
I mean, deltarune has a fair share of swearing in it, so maybe
It does? When?
help i didnt know piss was a swear 😂 (for context english is not my native language)
Ass
bro damn is not a swear
Depends on who you ask
Depends on the context used like being a replacement for an actual swear
good point.
Definitely Merg. I was already a fan of his and he made a reference while playing Deltarune, and all the comments in response got me intrigued enough to watch the (at the time) ongoing Omori series he was recording.
>!Don't lose your head Ralsei!<
Yep, this exact reference lol
Same
Merg is always 👌
based
Yup
austrian cherry gang
Same here
same
Finally got around to playing Deltarune earlier this year and heard about Omori through that community so decided to give it a shot
For some reason, all my gaming roads lead me to games about mentally ill children with knives (American McGee's Alice, Sally Face, Deltarune e.t.c)
I was in a deltarune server. . a few people were obsessed with omori and wouldn't shut up about it. . I looked into it and was hooked
Just was curious why it had the psychological horror theme on steam while I was looking for games similar to deltarune.
my friend mentioned it after the deltarune status update when they made an omori refrence and i thought it sounded cool and the. i watched playthroughs
I just found that game exist and my mind just told me "oh yeah, good game for your brain torture after torturing brain with Deltarune Snowgrave route"
I thought this was the deltarune fandom lol. Good to know I get recommendations from this game still, I remember being super into it when it came out and checking recent fanfics all the time
that's FRIEND from deltarune

Are they inside me?
Say that again..
Is it in you?⚡️
Bro?
whay
Started reading 20th century boys recently, and I must say friend seems like a menace.
r/friendinsideme
Imagined this dumbass face with the colour-corrected eyes plastered onto a bigass monster cat body, and started giggling to muself.
deltarune chapter 3
Me when the [[Goddam]] Mik3 appears:
You're already losing hope?. . \- a fan of Deltarune and Hollow Knight

Same 😭
Potassium enthusiast lady from Deltarune, is that you?
Why do people type that way?
Because They Are Adults, Who Are Just Bigger Children
bro what 
(I’m quoting Queen from Deltarune, she says that line when talking about adults)
Oh Yeah I Remember That Part Now!
When the habit is broken
I only type in all lowercase in certain circumstances. . I can’t type grammatically correctly 
Spelling is hard.
It’s A Habit ..
No Way This Is Only The 107373292th Time I’ve Heard This! I Can’t Believe You Didn’t Also Say “He’s Actually Writing An Essay Title Guys”
heh, sorry  couldn’t resist the urge to OH MAH GAAAWD LOOK 🍌<— IT IS POTASSIUM 🔫
No Don’t Shoot Yourself! . . I’ll Do It For You! 
Kris From Deltarune
i think it's deltarune
Deltarune. . 
😱😱😱😱😱
. . deltarune?
Was about to say Celeste, but the Deltarune stuff is suspicious
On the 9th photo is the raltz dummy from deltarune, so I gotta go with deltarune as your favorite game.
Very smert
Deltarune
Deltarune or smth i saw ralsei
What chapter is that ? (I’m waiting for omori chapters like deltarune chapters I’m going insane)
This is chapter 5, which released today! If you want to read it for free without sailing the seven seas, you will have to watch 3 ads daily for multiple days to get enough points.
But I’m not American 😭I can’t even access the site
. . Guess we posting deltarune memes now.



Kris, will you stop aurafarming for a sec?
. . no
Lollll not the deltarune memeeee 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am inevitable. I am... A deltarune fandom spy.
Deltarune x Omori, the ultimate crossover
Oh god… it’s Deltarune all over again
Who said the time of \[BIG SHOTS\] ended?
We've come full circle
Yeah people weren't too mad about the comparisons, because like you said they were using them for marketing advantages. But he didn't put them down in the description of the video. So company's twitter reached out and nicely asked. But Matpat got very defensive, saying " We've been really busy someone else must've forgot". . Then Toby came in and pretty much said "Stop making excuses, they deserve credit" and that sorted itself out. But Matpat still seems a bit angry at Toby, and I'm guessing that's why they haven't played deltarune chapter 2.
But not angry enough to stop playing Fnaf, in fact, he made a video explaining that he will continue making video regardless lmao. . What a total shill!
He keeps making fnaf videos because they do really well despite the fact that he's solved it at this point
[Matpat looking at Fnaf](). . And like I’ve said before, I can accept that he’s a shill, but a shill who thinks he can deny Toby Fox? Nah no honor lmao
Deltarune has a 2000ish feeling too, with its hilariously misinterpreting search engines and pop-up ads.. . . It still has it's fair share of sore thumbs, like the iPhone catti use is released in 2006
Deltarune and Omori is in the same universe
NO get that shit back to r/Deltarune
don’t put it back there either, we’re tired 😭 it was never funny and this shit is an embarrassment
Put it in the fire where it belongs.
It’s not ours! Well it is. But it’s not!
hey, i like your username. somehow feel like it could work for a secret codeword
No no no, I don’t know who told you that. That’s just plain goofy. It’s more of a secret-secret-triple-secret code word.
We need a subreddit for omori and deltarune stuff name it omorirune

deltomor
I made it
Send the sub
r/Omorirune
Undermori
That's the reference to Noelle character from DELTARUNE. People in r/deltarune are arguing about Noelle being trans. non stop. Now every character who has antlers in trans.
. . GO BACK TO THE BOULDER THATS r/Deltarune AND PLEASE DONT CRAWL OUT

Well either that or my Deltarune brainrot finally won out against my Hollow Knight brain rot and reached my eyes.
Deltarune brain rot
I'm imagining the deltarune explosion sound
***game maker 7 explosion***
Vote cast for Kris Deltarune.... . . 
Neverending knight from deltarune
Why is Deltarune on the iceberg? Is it the post Toby made about a similar game? I'm scared that I know most of the stuff on this iceberg...
We got Omori and 60% of Omori fansequel mod before GTA VI, Yandere Simulator, Deltarune Chapter 3 and Heavy Update  ☠️ (really happy about this tho)
We know when deltarune will be released, contrary to the pthers. And you still believe in yandere simulator?
True abt Deltarune. And naw on YS I just wanted to point out it's still not released/finished/whatever anyone expected bc it, the longer it takes the dev to give up/admit he's not gonna make it finished the funnier it gets imo.
It's spamton skin (deltarune). . 
MC grinning like Deltarune's Mike is getting me exited for the new lore added.
***deltarune enhances***
r/suddenlydeltarune
Go over to deltarune and ask Kris and the gang to help you out!
I don't know how I feel about unleashing more of these on my desktop, but at the very least I trust The $!$! Squad more than I trust Omori.. . 
Give him the Celeste icon, then while he’s eating strawberry drop him into Deltarune.
Deltarune, Omori and Celeste…. The gay and depressed teenager squad
Deploy Stanley and the narrator’s help. . Also, you have good taste! Omori, Stanley Parable, Portal, Celeste, Deltarune…
More than deltarune too, surprising
I'm seriously impressed at how much you guys popped off, Deltarune was struggling but you guys had two big spaces!
I just love how the first image of Deltarune I see there was just "GOD DAMMIT KRIS, WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE?"
deltarune
Elaborate
Spoilers
Dont care
Ok so to everyone else SPOILER WARNING IF YOU WANNA PLAY DELTARUNE GET OUT:. . >!deltarunes 2nd chapter has an alternate route that can only be achieved if the player uses a party member called noelle to defeat every single enemy with her IceShock spell. Enemies become frozen upon defeat and the message "Noelle became stronger" appears in the text box.!<. . >!Eventually, Noelle and Kris (the protagonist) encounter one of their childhood friends called Berdly, and the dialogue upon encountering him goes like this:!<. . >!There.
Wait... It is!? I legit thought i was using the final vesrion lmaoooooo. . Thank you for the info im gonna update it right now. . (also funfact: temmie chang uses it for spriting Deltarune and other stuff)
It was last updated in January, so you might already have the newest version.
Deltarune moment
I enjoy that this could be referencing either Snowgrave or Gun Ralsei
FAITH* moment
I've somehow been elected as r/Deltarune's diplomat. Yes, we did get permission to add Susie! Thank you all sm for that btw
Shoulda been ralsei smh my head
please do not use my head after smh😭😭
But if I don’t it won’t make sense? That’s like saying “laughing out”. People would look at me like I’m crazy! Smh my head
I've been trying to add him above madotsuki
that wouldn't allow a god fucking damnit kris where the fuck are we
this is honestly such a mood, in place 2, I basically stayed up 36 hours, and I become the official diplomat for r/Minecraftathome , the r/VRchat group (and one of their main tech ppl despite not knowing what I was doing at all, I was the only person who could get templates to work), and one of the main people placing for r/pxlsspace. . r/place really does that to you
so have i lol
as a deltarune-er, I say this is an alliance
OMGA I LOVE DELTARUNE SM
Honestly the idea of territory and genuine alliances and competitions between subs for shit on this board has always been so fucking funny to me ever since the first place thing, alliance between Omori, yummy Nikki, and deltarune is the most wholesome ever
Add Ralsei Deltarune
Kris Deltarune is that you?
oh my god kris deltarune!!! i'm such a big fan
Kris can you hit my gas line???
wtf did i miss in that game. . was there a chapter where kris joined a terrorist organization and blew up the high school
It’s kind of a reference to how Kris apparently has a history of putting bath bombs in the toilet.

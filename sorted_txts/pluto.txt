Pluto would’ve been proud
Thank god for Pluto
>Papyrus was accidentally rammed by Pluto, who **then apologized for this since he is a chad and not a jerk who says “you’re in my way”, and was instantly forgiven by the equally chad Papyrus**.. . Fixed that for you.

Hello Lattethecoffeaddict from the hit former planet, Pluto
I am utterly jealous by the looks of the images, I wish PLUTO would assist in traveling
Now pluto expanded lifting them all with a finger
Oh yeah, I remembered seeing her from somewhere, I just couldn't find what it was. Never heard of Pluto's twice removed cousin.
UPDATE 5:  . been playing for a bit more and ive done the mixtape, killed the earth and did the first pluto spaceline thingy.
UPDATE 6:. . what he fuck just happened.. . why am i back in white space.. . why was that thing from the notebook on the stairs.. . why was there a hung noose.. . what is happening A.
update 7:. . game made me st@b myself again...
pluto anyone?
Heyo I didn’t knew Pluto could play piano
Pluto
Yall its pluto playing the piano, like cmon its obvious
Or that one combined attack of Pluto and earth
I tried this a while ago but lost motivation after an insane occurrence. I had a plan to go through the hikikomori route at least twice to ensure I get all the achievements while not confusing/burdening myself too much trying to get them all in a single run, which I assumed was going to be very difficult.. . Tried to get as many achievements as I could on the first run and soon discovered that getting them all in one run was definitely not as hard as I thought. One of the big ones was the achievement for filling out the foe facts book.. . I get to the end of the game and realise I missed ONE enemy. That happened because of an assumption I made early on about Pluto. Know how you have to fight him 3 times? In my mind, I didn’t really consider the first encounter an actual enemy separate from Pluto. I mean, I’m going to fight him later anyways and put him in the journal. What’s the point in wasting time on a fight I don’t need to?. . Turns out I was wrong. He counts as a unique enemy and was the single entry I didn’t encounter. I’d have to redo the ENTIRE journal route because of a single enemy. Technically, I hadn’t beaten perfectheart yet and was the only other achievement I needed from the hikikomori route, but the point still stands. The thought of doing that crushes my motivation for redoing it.
You should always check a guide before...
I thought it was Pluto😟
Pluto??
Pluto
No… they’re in faraway
Pluto? 🗿

Pluto
another hint: you give it clams
Ultimate form Pluto
Honestly even when you say that it's not poor, for me it is because i have bad memory and i'm kinda lost to your description lmao. . Is it Pluto?
no. but its living in the otherworld, too. you can see him in the deep well. .
Pluto?
The one and only!
Pluto best girl
well akhshually it was "considered" as a planet back then . . pluto hasnt changed just the title has
True!
Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2009 iirc so that still checks out.
Oh, that's the mirror jumpscare! You have a small chance of getting that jumpscare whenever you check a mirror after beating Pluto (expanded). Hope that helps! 
Thanks! this is my first play through and I was very confused lol
You're welcome! 
this game has quite a few random events like this, there's even a value in the back end of the game that will decide how many of these kinds of events happen during the game (the mirror is the 1 event not tied to it tho I'm pretty sure), it's called the wtf value and it's actually really interesting to look into once you're done your playthough, some wild stuff happens the higher up it gets lol
there’re a few random-chance surprises hidden throughout the game that you may or may not run into
do you know what % it is? I know it's small but not sure how exact. . . edit: nvm saw it on another comment it's 5
But only after defeating >!expanded Pluto!<.
Yes, AKA >!after you've regained the party on Two Nights Left. So in other words, it has to be on Two Nights Left or later!<
... How? The mirror jumpscare in headspace only occurs after pluto (EXPANDED) battle
honestly? PLUTO, no context needed
Nah I get it, I love how the game plays, well, the long game, with Pluto. When you meet him at the start of the game it’s just a silly boss fight, but when he shows up in the resort and an epic showdown between master and pupils ensues, AND he becomes a f*cking Jojo character of all things, it’s just great.

Fair.
The dude with the basketball that blew up pluto
Pluto for sure
1: auby 2: space boyfriend 3: pluto 4: snuuy 5: pluto

Objectively correct response.
I shall train for the body...

Pluto def
No, it's actually in the late 2000s. What about Pluto in headspace? He wouldn't be there if it was still considered a planet.
Really? Thought I saw a few different sources who said 90's.
Pluto being in headspace is one. He scapes the solar system in the dream world, which would symbolise the fact Pluto wasn't considered a planet anymore since 2006. So omori takes place between 2006 and 2010
In any case if it's actually in the 2000s I'm happy 
Again, there is no official date for it, so it doesn't matter.. . But why would Pluto be special in headspace in the first place?
Because the term "Rogue Planet" is an actual thing. . Sunny most probably heard of the name, and imagination did its thing. . Pluto is *still* considered a planet in Headspace. . Also, I wasn't around back then, but I don't think these things would be "today Pluto is a planet, tomorrow it's not and never should've been". . ^(also you brought up Pluto not me lol)
It better be Pluto
Hmmm ig it's pluto
Bro😭 he looks like >!Blackspace 2 pluto😭😭😭😭😭!<
Pluto
I think it's pretty obvious that it's Pluto
Ah yes, Pluto, the very flexible 'dwarf planet'!
pluto
I always thought the game took place soon after August 2006 since that was when it was announced that Pluto was no longer a planet. Although, it could have been announced earlier in the Omori universe.
The first year after 2006 that fits the calendar is 2013, and there's no shot they put a Walkman in a game that takes place in 2017. Heck, the game was in development earlier than that. I think the line "Perhaps Pluto wasn't meant to be a planet" is just there as a joke in reference to how Pluto would eventually be reclassified, rather than an indication that it's already happened by that point. (Kinda reminds me of [this]().)
also the fact that pluto isin't here is even worse
I did roughly the same. It would’ve been 3 playthroughs, but I missed the first Pluto encounter on my OMORI route.
When I was doing my second playthrough (Omori route), I missed a single enemy for the Foes Filed achievement.. . A ghost bunny.. . So I did a speedrun and spent an entire day playing the game and killing everything on my way.
It can only appear after the pluto expanded fight

thanks bro
zawg u have to beat pluto ex. first
How about no. Instead, add an emoji of a MUCH better and more important character, Pluto

Haha, what a find! It could be someone's custom-printed shirt, I have no idea
That's just a face you can't just say it's Pluto. . *Swipes*. . Omg omor
I wasn’t sure if it was an omori shirt at first either, Pluto looks very purple here
That orange makes it looks way worse
> doesn't drink orange joe
That's just my man Mercury 
I love Mercury 
I'd do anything for my local shops to have shirts this cool
I will make a store full of Pluto t shirts. Just for you.
t-shirt sellers don't give a shit about copyright lol
Did you buy it? I would have for sure!
Nah, neon orange isn’t really my colour
Oh, I don't know that I would ever have worn it except around the house for some giggles. It would have "annoyed" my daughter, who rolls her eyes at my Pluto impersonation. 
Annoy her even more
Please tell me you bought it
. . WHEN I FLEX I FEEL MY BEST
BUY IT!. . . . . . . . NOOOOOOOOW!
I appreciate how enthusiastic you are about this, but I saw it there a year ago. I doubt it’s still around… guess I missed my once in lifetime opportunity to own this precious artifact.
I would buy it without thinking

>!mewo is alive and well!<
>!Also Mari. This picture seems to be a "what if accident never happened" scenario. Fate of Mewo in actual story remains ambiguous.!<
stop it with your facts and logic :(
I wish I could stop inflicting myself on me too...
>!I only just noticed that Mewo seemed to still live with Sunny in the original trailer. Part of me just wants to hope that she's living with one of his parents during the game, but it's probably too wishful a scenario.!<
>!I didn’t notice that was an option at first, but even if I did I probably would’ve still cut mewo open just to see what would happen. In either case the game truly wins, because either you make yourself kill yourself thinking it’s the best option, or you cut open your cat for absolutely nothing, and you kill yourself afterwards knowing it’s the only option!<
Jeez how horrific... I'm going to try cutting the cat now that I know I can
/late, but I just finished the game and I'm not proud to admit I actually had to look up if >!cutting up Mewo was necessary (thank God it wasn't). Animal abuse is one of my big triggers and I genuinely got *this* close to breaking down in that scene.!<
its neat that something so distant from actual reality can make us feel so strongly, i heard a while ago that our brains cant distinguish from fiction characters and real ppl i wonder if thats true
5 seconds on Twitter will give you your answer xd
I just wanted to try crafting some Al Pastor Tacos with meal meat (they heal 50 heart 50 juice for the entire party)
>!That scene was the one time my compulsive need to check every possibility paid off, and I found the stab option before I cut mewo!<
>!The game really said "suicide is the only option!<
just like irl;)
r/holesome
No. You're supposed to breathe and age and die of starvation and thirst what the heck you guys got the wrong ending
#FUCK THAT WAS OPTIONAL!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
yep. open the menu and you can stab yourselg instead of the cat before you kill the cat.
FUCK I THOUGHG THAT WOULD RUIN THE ENDING SO I DIDNT DO IT
F
Mewo stares at you
She does not know what is happening
stop, ir really hurt
Mewo has been very very bad
oh no. . ***bunnies***. . Also I think I see Mewo too. :D
Same ( ╹▽╹ )
In the bottom left theres mewo
Oh god, what is that... that *abomination* above Mewo?!
that would be a bunny from a worse reality. . oh wait.... . uh oh
TURN IT TO MEAT AND MICROWAVE IT
+ mewo. . . .. . . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . .. . I . . Fucking. . Love. . It
Did anyone notice Mewo in the corner?
Mewo is better honestly
Hector is better
I'm sorry sir I cannot agree with you for this
Who cares about Omori characters. . . . WARIO
Too powerful, stop
Where's Mewo?
Mewo has been very, very bad.
Mewo has been replaced by zabloing
Mewo just observing like: 👁👄👁
Mewo doesn't exist
He’s outside the white space blanket so he couldn’t be carried over
Mewo should have stood up and pointed too 
"Mewo stares at you, she looks like she is going to explode"
“Do you want to detonate meow?”
Explodomori: everything is exactly the same but you blow yourself up to escape headspace
Yes but also everyone is just a bomb
killer queen already touched the cat
Exploding kittens
>! Mewo doesn't know what's going on.... Do you want to explode Mewo? !<
Mewo was an impostor
Mewo trying to decide what to do is the funniest thing I've seen in a long while
Even mewo is confused
Mewo is so confused on which is her master.
I LOVE MEWO AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSJSJSJSHSHSS
w- wut happened to mewo- O\O
Do you want to cut open MEWO?
that escalated quickly
Shhhhhhhh think of the folks who know and have permanent PTSD!!
You can leave the room without doing that you do know that right?
Yes.  . Yes Yes Yes Yes
MEWO stares at you. She does not know what is happening.
Do you wanna cut open mewo?. . yes. . no
Yes
(Hits X) GOD F*CKING DA-
*Oh Mewo, art in White Space.. grant us the Omori for Nintendo Switch, or the strength to pursue of nigh...*
She had the tiniest mewo studs
i had put those on him already, i lost one of them recently though😿
Oh no!
the mewo earrings 😭
THE LITTLE MEWO EARRINGS??
Mewo earrings,,,,,, I want them 🥺
Where did you get the mewo piercings??
thekawaiiod on etsy😁
TYSM
Mewo doesn't show up in the Real World because >!she was sent into a machine recreating a dead world inside a sentient depressed computer!<. . OneShot spoilers, kinda^
No, that's for the mewo plush. We have that one already!
Mewo-naise
What about mewo?
Sneak the cat in
Just palyed the ending and didn't realise you didn't have to kill mewo 
mewo *absolutely* would've worn a bow tie
I've always headcanoned him as autistic because he reminded me of myself when I was a kid, but I'm not sure if that was the intention. >!Him hiding in the present box with mewo and enjoying being buried in the sand definitely came off as sensory related to!<
Is mewo ALSO Kamala Harris
no Mewo is Michael Caine
Okay the meme black cat in your pfp fits Mewo very well 😂
*Mewo when you dont wait for something to happen
Oh no . . Kinda like the spiders!
Guys let's make Mewo win
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,551,825,126 comments, and only 293,742 of them were in alphabetical order.
Good bot
The prophecy
Meow (if you let me win I will let you pet me all the time)
I second this.
Meow(Yes)
I concur
Agreed, mewo is best
this didn't age well
or mewo
Leave mewo alone
I think they meant that either the six of them or mewo Will be one of The finalists
Ah yes, that is what I meant. Probably should have made that clearer
MEWO has to stay  till the end
We need to make sure that mewo survives until almost the end of wins
If mewo doesn't win im leaving the omori fandom /j /nsrs
Mewo
Mewo
We must protect our sweet bean mewo. Mewo has done nothing to us.
Mewo. The most boring character in omori, it's just a cat.
Mewo.
Mewo isn't even a character it's just a cat
mewo better take home this w
Mewo.
Watch Mewo win this
Let mewo win!
MEWO NO
*56-12-2 starts playing*
>!DO YOU WANT TO CUT OPEN MEWO?!<
OF COURSE I FUCKING DO


"Omori is getting a new patch! You can no longer choose stab in the menu to avoid cutting open Mewo in black space."
Mewo
Any cat owner agrees that the cat dominates the household
I'm a dog person even though I don't have pets, but I can tell from my ex-girlfriend that yes, that's true.
Facts
I don’t think you >! Use a spoon to dissect !<
>!I do, to myself, Mewo must live for eternity!<
Mewo has been very very bad
They face each other with Mewo and all their stuffed animals in the middle
Mewo 
both, they just switch on mood, also sometimes mewo sneaks in between them to get toasty on cold nights
Awhhh that sounds adorable
>!Mewo has been a very bad kitty!<
>!Do you want to cut open Mewo?!<
Yes 

What?
Bro really didn't let it slide for the second time.
nuh uh 🥺
I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate I hate
:(

What about >!Mewo has been a very bad kitty!<?
this is it for me
For me personally, it's: "Mewo has been very, very bad."
Waiting for something to happen?. . >!There's something behind you...!<. . >!You loved her and you killed her.!<. . >!Mewo has been a very bad cat...!<. . Welcome to Whitespace, you have been living here for as long as you can remember.
Opt 4 orrrr option 5, mewo
i think mewo is too rotund for me to draw properly. anytime i draw her she looks like she’s melting
Touche, I can't draw her either lol
I have a suggestion: the juice icon in-between Mewo and Omori :D
Stab who?. . > Yourself 👈. . .  Mewo
I tried to make a mewo but everytime i try  it's instantly wiped out
Mewo is adorbs
Kitti...
tiny. smal. baby. 
she’s also very, very bad

Stab who?
Mewo bad

Mewo has been very, very bad.

>!cut him open!<


nO
I'm too lazy to do homework, that's how
mewo
i want to pet mewo so bad she is so cute and funny
Tbh I might just be dense but I always thought that she was just somewhere, running around Faraway town. Also, I'm pretty sure there was a little scene on 2 days left where you can see Mewo meowing and jumping away. Not sure if that was also a hallucination
That was a hallucination. Mewo probably died and if I remember well people we theorizing that she got euthanized.
That’d make sense, considering even Omori didn’t seem to want to do it considering how much you need to click through to actually cut Mewo open
>!In blackspace 2 there's a pond and if you check it it says "You see a boy burying something in a backyard" and I thought that could be Sunny burying Mewo after killing her because she reminded him too much of Mari and Mewo probably missed her... :c!<
The part where we had to cut open mewo fucked me up so bad. Not to mention we had to kill ourselves after that to get out of there.
The worst part is that you don't even HAVE to do it. The butler hands you the key as soon as you speak to him once. But you're not even told that it's enough, you just assume that this is what you have to do next.
Which is effective in making people feel guilty,  you didnt need to yet you did
Holy shit i feel horrible
shhh, it's alright, the cat wasn't alive either way, don't beat yourself up over it
>!I have a theory that mewo was unintentionally killed by sunny himself. Black space consist of suppressed memories , and sunny have a tendency to destroy anything that remind him of mari(eg : photo album) as a lot of comments pointed out mewo seems to be hallucinated. Mewo is too young to die from old age and she did appear in black space in a very messed up section!<
If the butler is mewo then in black space it would tell you that he has been a bad cat? You're probably onto something, but I don't think it is this straightforward
I don't think a lot of the things in this thread are very straight forward lol. I do like a lot of wild theories though especially since it lets me dive back in temporarily since I've 100%-ed the game already and don't really have a concrete reason to play again.
The hell happened to my baby Mewo
For real I need to know this. So fucking bad.
Mewo still lost very quickly lmao
Yeah, at the end all of this only made the contestants of both groups get out of the competition
HOW THE FUCK IS MEWO OUT
It was revenge against the mewo lovers for voting out Basil.
IM WITH YOU BROTHER
Mewo’s out, no point in voting 😔
Still pissed af that MEWO got kicked out that early
She forgot to do her homework till 1 in the morning, and spent almost the whole night trying to get it done.
you guys killed mewo??? it's not fair :c
The "hey, can I copy your homework?" Meme but without asking for permission
I want mewo to win cause cat
Same. . (my flair also checks out)
r/flairchecksout
Mewo superior
\#mewosweep #mewolliondollars
Meow (waiting for me to win)
MEWO
Only mewo 
Can’t wait for the mewo sweep
Good job, you changed my fucking side
Yesssss mewo best
Same
I like him too but he's the only one who is not in the main cast. There is also Mewo, but Mewo is a cat so... sorry 
if mewo get voted out i will cry
gets*
SAME i love mewo
I am voting out Mewo as I want to drink the tears of the Mewo supporters.
Mewo has been very, very bad
 Oh y’all are going to hate this…I vote Mewo.
its fine  . . 
I mean, she's probably gonna be voted out anyways due to the massive amounts of main characters in this poll
Choose Mewo! Take that kitten to the pound and put it down!!!
U good bro?
Heresy
i like mewo like everyone else but like compared to everyone else mewo just yknow exists at least spaceboy had a character arc. . so yeah im voting mewo
mewo
im sorry little one..  . (mewo)
"Do you want to cut open Mewo?". . "Yes"
mewo for the win
Are we letting mewo win or what
I vote mewo
Idc whos out as long as Mewo wins cause..cat! 
Mewo
Mewo, it's a tertiary character at best
Sorry but mewo needs to go :c
I'm sorry Mewo.... But I gotta vote you off
I hate to do this but Mewo (only bc I can’t decide on the ppl :(
Mewo
Mewo, she's gotta go.
MEWO SHOULD WIN NOBODY VOTE MEWO OR ELSE!!
>!If anything it's healthier for Sunny if the dream world friends are erased in favor of the real ones.!<. . ...and Mewo. Mewo shall not succumb!
MEWO fans I decree that now the fake flower femboy is gone, we should focus out attacks on the real flower femboy.. . Also good decision op to make the results unknown, now people can't cheat and tell everyone "X is gonna lose" which then gives said X's team to mass vote someone else.
Then you are a disgrace to the MEWO army! Destroy the flower lover! STRIKE HIM DOWN!
Mewo is superior. . Capitalist teenager vs that one black cat
We are in an allience we both help each other didn't you get the memo
Hah... you will help one another until one no longer finds the deal useful. Then you will turn on each other, and we will be there to watch you crumble and burn.. . 
flair checks out
Again, we'll make a civilized agreement on who well crown the winner out of the characters that lie in the Army Bussiness Cats. Hopefully we'll get to an agreement, and if we don't, the oh no that's bad
Mewo will be able to see another day, and eventually win!
Meow (We will feed their corpses to our goddess of death, Mewo.)
Mewo too
Meow~. . (This is no intimidating. This is the real threat. I, as a follower of Mewo, will capture these non-believers. For our dearest Mewo!)
The rumors are true... the Business Cats are indeed domestic terrorists!. . 
Meow. . (. . . . )
YESSSSS MEWO LIVES ANOTHER DAY
MEWO WILL WIN IDC WHAT YALL WANT MEWO WILL WIN!!!!!!
MEWO FTW!!!!
LET MEWO LIVE
MEWO WON THE BATTLE YESSSSS
mewo i'm sorry I >!need that key!<

Yes, but I'm voting mewo if it comes down to Mari vs Mewo
Mewo MUST win
Replace the M and W with H and R the you will get the right answer
Mewo gotta go 
A worthwhile cause when it comes to Mewo.
You Mewo fans are starting to get annoying, at first I didn’t mind the cat, but now all my homies are voting out Mewo 😈😈😈
How can you hate an innocent cat

Mewo (Human form), you achieve this by not >!killing mewo in black space!<
I know this is a joke but can you actually do that?
>!In Black Space there is the room called the punishment room, and there is a way not to kill mewo you just get the key from waiter cat and then stab yourself to get out!<
Yeah you can dice it up
Mewo waiting for something to happen
Mewo animatronic when

Don't you guys DARE vote mewo out
Mewo is staying!
Yeah but, guys also stop voting for headspace flower boy!! You’re gonna make him cryy!. .  <- oblivious to his impending doom
The flower boy doesn't deserve it
Mewo stayysss
\#MEWOSWEEP
There's two ways this will end up:. . 1°- Everyone agrees in voting out everyone else and leave Mewo as the winner.. . 2°- Mewo is voted out.. . I honestly hope the latter happens. Seeing the whole sub light on flames sounds like a fun view 
Agreed and Mewo is near tied with DW Basil.
&#x200B;. . 
Anyone but Mewo. Mewo must win
They will vote mewo 💔
y’all really wanna >!cut open mewo!< eh
Mewo has been a bad cat
I disagree. She is very good and the bestest cat. Yes, she ran away, but she's always kept omor company in white space. I love mewo and think cats are some of the cutest, evil, loving, wonderful lifeforms.
Bro valifies in my book with the lovedeath+robots K-VRC pfp
Mewo has been very, very bad.
MEWO stares at you. She does not know what's happening. 
Mmm feels like salt and lemon on a fresh wound
That sounds like it would hurt

They may be wanting to learn English better. I played Digital Devil Story in Japanese as homework basically haha.
Playing digital devil story itself feels like homework
Lots of grinding
And the translation is not that good
It's not perfect, but it's okay.
For Omori?
and mewo is mewonder women
~~mewo~~ therapy’s been a very bad boy
Computer, no light and a crap ton of random cans.
"Guys rate my setup."
No tissue boxes? Are you suuuure?
Depends if it's the allergy season.
A Switch with OMORI on it, an official guide & artbook for OMORI, a notebook with OMORI fun facts, compiled lore, speculations and theories, a shrine of all the OMORI characters plushies and miscellaneous merchandises and a comfortable bed.
I'm gonna go off on a limb here and I suspect you like OMORI.
what a preposterous assumption
RUDE! Don't just assume someone's an Omori fan! That's just basic manners, dude!
The inventor mole sprout would NOT be pleased to hear you use the the B.E.D
a laptop, a drawing tablet, a bass guitar and my pet cat.. . not too different lmao
A lot of answers seem to follow an order that goes something like technology/entertainment, comfort, and creative mediums, so it's fine.
Same but a keyboard instead of the bass lol
I was about to say the exact same thing-
A computer, VR headset, Probably like a phone or smth and my pet dog
A computer with omori on it, cheer sheets, my normal ass room and a glock 17 
the og gameboy?
hell no!!!! i'm getting the advanced
All the same things minus a cat 
Where did the cat go 
i eated it

You make me wanna cry that's (in my opinion). really cruel but I do respect your opinion
He will eat another
i will eat another
You ate the cat? You put it in a microwave first or did you just eat it raw
Erm.. A-actually.. It's.. 'Ate'....
So they ated it?
Asian
\*visibly horrified\*. . \*pulls out knife\*. . \*continues looking horrified while stabbing the cat murderer\*
Please do not the cat
im gonna the cat 
>! The hat man told me to cut it open because it was being naughty !<

I’ve always interpreted as him being sick not him being bad
I cried when cat butler made me kill mewo 
>!Mewo has been really, really bad!<
actually the same stuff. What-
You’d have Mewo too? :O
A pipebomb
Miku?
Satan get out of this body * pulls out crucifix *
A laptop, xylophone, two stack of pillows, journal

A desk full of Drawing books and tools, a laptop,a phone and a couch 
approximately 263 autism creature plushies and also mewo

A laptop, sketchbook or drawing tablet, headphones, and a cat.
laptop, pc mouse, an infinite bottle of cold water, and mewo in a cage
why mewo “in a cage” specifically ?
I don't want mewo to run in me keyboard
Because >!Mewo has been really, really bad!<
A phone, charger, outlet, a window, a rocket jumper, mortar shell, laptop with the hit game Omori
do not disrespect the blahaj 

Same things-
A switch, a drawing tablet, a chandelier, and a recliner with a puppy sleeping on it.
Knife
a phone and a long noodly ass ikea shark and a fat ass ikea djungleskog
headphone, phone, tablet, and my bolster
As a lucid dreamer I noticed some recurrent stuff whenever I spawn in a dream.. . So my stuff would probably be: a TV, a window, a tree, a toy gun, a dissection table, a white cat with one eye, a toilet and my younger brother.
Computer, An entire fullscreen TV with a playstation 4, and Mewo atop of a tower of gold thrones..
A console, sketchbook, a pillow, and piano.
something
- nintendo switch. - laptop. - drawing tablet. - sketchbook. - phone. - cat. - headphones . - plushie mountain. . yeah. that's all i can think of for now!! 👍
Laptop, notebook, piano, cat :3 basically the same
Photos of myself
A sketch book, a light, a nintendo switch, a laptop, and a knife
6 mewos
I wonder what i would have.... A fan, blanket, a notebook with some black pencils, and a small needle
Same with the tissues. Except more tissues. And more tissues. Allergies, bro.
A phone with contact to friends that I lost (not death), A soft heavy blanket, a computer DEFINITELY,  and a random fox because comfort.
My cat, computer, books, weighted blanket, and stuffed toys.
A mattress.. . Maybe a diary too.
laptop, notebook, amazon kindle, husky plushie
My pc, my cat and my guitars and their related peripherals.
I’d have my adorable pet dog named Penny, a computer with FL studio and Spotify, a guitar, and a multipedal.
A laptop, ~~another laptop~~, several plushies, 4 lightbulbs (only two of them work), a chess set and some skin care
Computer, phone, bed and my terrariums!

Drawing tablet, computer, my cat and pillows
A Rubik's cube, a laptop, a card deck, a couch and my cat
my laptop, phone, nintendo switch, ps3, tv, tissues (in case i cry), probably a bunch of flags, comfy armchair and books
Computer, Nintendo Switch, Endless Pizza Btes/Anything, a Rat.
A computer, a warm drink, a cat, and a desk with a notebook and ring light on it. Not for comfort, but I often imagine what my own Omori would be like. These are items with a lot of meaning when I was in lockdown and struggling with depression.
a laptop, a notebook (with lines, not a sketchbook), a pair of headphones and a cardboard box because i can do a lot with a cardboard box
Violin, Laptop, My parrot pet, and a printer
i dont have pets, but everything else stays the same
a laptop, a sketchbook, a piano, a scented candle, and... a cat. eyah not that different. . i would turn the volume up and blast "the mind electric demo 4 nightcore" on loop.
Phone, bed, MY cat and a never ending bag of pretzels
PC, bed, outlet, random cans and bottles in the corner, and a single core memory.
Sketchbook and/or notebook, phone, and my plague doctor plushie
Mini fridge full of beer is all I'd need.
A laptop, another laptop, anothernother laptop, a desktop, 3 more desktops, an AIO, an Arch Linux boot USB, and mewo

A old iPad , an art book , some ramen and probably a small trash can
My nintendo switch, my cat, my squishmallows, and my makeup bag
Laptop, drawing equipment, bed, dog and mewo
Pretty much the same except I will have my pug instead of cat
Grilled cheese
I'll be honest, I'd probably also have a laptop. Then I'd either have a sketchbook or a stack of reading-books. Uh... then probably a very old doll I've had since I was very young. And... I don't know what instead of Mewo. Maybe that's the stack of books.
It would have Spamton plush, my cat (fun fact I did see her in my dreams today), my laptop with drawing display tablet, my dragon mask staring at me, a shit ton of posters, a scented candle. Everything would be in white with a bit of teal.
3ds and a few games, notebook, laptop, bed, cat. Perhaps candy if food is allowed
A small mountain of lego, a gaming laptop with a second monitor and separate keyboard and mouse.. AND THE THING WOULD BE FLASHING RAINBOW
My computer. My little brother who has the same functionality as a cat. A light. A blanket and a spool of copper wire.
Well, I’d start with a bed, some walls, floor, ceiling, some windows, a wardrobe, a tv, a desk with a full on gaming setup, a very comfy beanbag, some fairy lights, one of those playing tents, a mini fridge (for when I’m hungry 😋😋😋😋), ofc I’m also gonna have drawing supplies and shit like that, a PS5, an Xbox, a Nintendo switch (and games for all them), a very cool gaming chair and some plushies (I know I didn’t put as many things and as expensive as y’all did  but I only added the necessary)
Desktop, book, notebook, cat, toys, piano, table and chair.
A desk PC, a bed , and my pet also a. shower ( I really like the warm bath). ( It's the same but is apply to me)
Empty coffee cup. Record player. Candles.
A always cool sided pillow with an blanket, my gaming pc, an project car with all the tools and parts to fix it, and my Pigeon.
For me, it would be a teddy bear my laptop, and my sketchbook
A laptop, my cat, a phone and a bottle of Lipton Ice Tea.
O    r     b   .
A laptop, materials for a TTRPG, a pot plant and one of my dogs
A gun
I'd still have a computer and a sketchbook, but instead of tissues I'd have my Nintendo Switch. I even have a cat to take Mewo's place!
my cat prim would replace mewo and my 3ft stuffed penguin would replace the tissue box. other than that life is the same
A guitar, a keyboard, a sketch book, and a bean bag
A PC, a charger, bed, food, my dog, a hámster, and a LED Light replacing the lightbulb
Some plushies, a drawing pad but i don’t have the laptop to use it, my yorkie, and a small gaming console
Laptop, tissue box, lotion
A PC, my phone, an electric guitar plus amp, and a blanket
Computer, bed, and a fresh cucumber laying on the floor in which for some reason it doesn’t rot.
an ipad with procreate on with unfinished portraits, eye drops, a box of makeup and my chihuahua, Lisa
A computer, my phone, a box just big enough to fit me, a stuffy, Mewo, and something to chew on
Picture of gf, mini fridge, radio, and… tissues
Computer with mouse, a trash can, s drawing tablet, and a waddle Dee plush
A tablet for digital art, a sketch book, my pet fish, and a shit ton of chocolate
My laptop, headphones, a bird and a pencil bag (with pencils/pens inside)
But that’s all I need…
just mewo
Phone with just the drawing program and Spotify with just a couple songs that are my favorite (that would change over time as I visit my headspace), a warm coverlet with a pillow, and a tap with warm water because I love feeling it on my hands. Not sure about an animal/companion like Mewo because I don't have a pet and I don't feel a close connection to any animal, plant or toy, I think. Maybe there could be a window with nostalgic landscapes that change over time and it's always early morning with pretty sun rays though . . Edit: maybe actually one of cats I used to have as a kid (an orange one) or a paper cut out that was supposed to be my grandma's dog that I made and disposed of sadly. Either way one of them would maybe sit on the windowsill or outside of window

My two pet cats, a laptop, no lights, and a piano

A smartphone, a sketchbook, a blanket + pillow and an intractable pair of wings where mewo is, when interacting with them it would switch between two people.. . The light bulb would stay where it is I think
Can I have stuff I don't own? If so, a VR Headset, 1,000 games I do not own, a PS5, 1,000 books I haven't read of my favourite genres,  a laptop with an internet connection and my phone. Alongside tons and tons of snacks. Oh yeah, there's no health problems in Whitespace is there? Also a fridge stocked with every delicacy on Earth.
A laptop, lights, rest of food, a TV and a bunch of books
My cats named Polo and Charlotte. A book. Some biscuits and some photos of me and my friends

Still a laptop XD. . A bookcase. . A mirror . . And my dog Firulais (mixed-breed)
A laptop, a wifi thingie, an unlimited box of crisps and my keychain
Most likely the same things except mewo would be a dog named Moon instead
My bulldog, my dolphin plush, brown leather diary, and a tv with south park playing on repeat that gets static-y
Okay, prepare for something creative:. . 3 gaming monitors with a small black lightbulb on a gaming desk with a whole PC setup.. A comfrotable XL bed in the corner.. A omori-themed nintendo switch with references to other games on it.. OMORI plushies. A Smash Bros Poster of Omori as a character. . That's it.

Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,546,324,010 comments, and only 292,691 of them were in alphabetical order.
A gun, phone, an all white cat named Felipe, a helmet and a light bulb that doesn’t work
A tree
My cat, my violin, phone, computer, and some of my indoor plants. Honestly I have no idea if white space would support plants.
Laptop, My own cat, Nintendo Switch (for some reason) and a crap ton of plants
laptop, my dogs, books and tissue box
My bed, my computer setup, chair and a pocket knife. Honestly my room is kind of my own Whitespace because I spend so much time there.
laptop, rubiks cubes, flags of the world (my notebook), my cat, my omori plushies
my tablet or playstation (if it counts) a sketchbook pillows and my dog
I guess it depends on the actual abstract meaning of the items involved in the original white space. It's been described as a place to survive, but not to live. Hence, why I guess there's no furniture, despite seeming like some kind of bedroom. At least to me. Only simple miscellaneous items that provide mild comfort are involved. So I'd probably have a TV and PS4 setup as an equivalent to the laptop, a noise canceling machine, headphones, and a phone. (I assume white space doesn't have any wifi or cell service though.)
My bed and my wii
My loved ones. . . . Jk, probably my xbox
My pets (obv), generate food generator (if i'm going to stay there i gotta eat something), a bed, a switch to make it black space (because dark mode), my phone and computer, AND a TV with a buncha consoles. oh, and a door, obv
computer, cat, minifreezer and keyboard
my own two cats, a laptop, a rubix cube (varying shades of grey for side colors), napstablook pillow plush, and a weighted blanket-if that’s too much then just send the weighted blanket away >!to black space!<
Wait, why does Omori have a tissue box??? 
A computer with a wall so I can stick leds with my computer,  a sketchbook, a pet orchid mantis, black and white of course, and prolly keep Mewo
Replace the notebook with a guitar and you have every important thing in my room anyway
My own cat
Laptop, Router, Soda, and my stuffed animals.
My device, cat, and my piano and violin (that was not meant to be ironic)
Drum kit, guitar, guitar amp and lead, drum sticks
laptop, a lot of blankets, a dimmer light, sketchbook, and plushies
Computer, saxophone, piano and Switch.
Laptop stays,my dog,my sketch book and lube
all of my ocs and a full on computer  . emotional support and entertainment yknow
probably the same things but the mewo would be my 2 dogs
headphone, a computer and my phone
my bed, a stack of post it notes, and my phone
The device I use to animate, a painting kit with canvas, internet connection and a notepad for ideas. Also, instead of a white rug, it will be a colorful painted one, and the black lightbulb is replaced with a color changing one.
Instead of a laptop there would be an ipad, instead of the notebook there would be a nintendo switch, instead of tissue box, there would be a comfortable sofa that could be usen as a bed and a Mari plush instead of Mewo.
A tv with a gaming console just to watch back good moments of course
The PC, a fridge, my Peashooter Plush and my school bag. . . . . Hold up that is literally my dorm room
Laptop, gigantic teddy bear, vr (to escape reality) and a friendly cat
PC, Switch, a lifetime supply of food and drink.
A comfy bed, a small library of my favorite books, a big computer, a cat, and a Wii U
Computer phone notebook and cat
TWO CATS!!!!
In my white space in high school (cuz I definitely was in a major depression ) was my desk, computer, diary and sketchbook (i did eventually burn when I was in college)  I gotta say. Im glad im not there anymore
It’s sad but that’s exactly what I would say 
(this is really specific) my brother's nintendo DSi , my sketchbook and my shitty laptop
a comically small tent with an gaming setup inside, a brick wall (markers included), a bottle of shampoo and my dearest boy sebastian (he is a lizard)
all my train models, my phone and laptop
My cat, my phone, pillow, and my sketch pad
A bunch of steam games on a PC, a Joe Hawley Joe Hawley vinyl, and a machete
3ds, sketchbook, crt and switch
Oh well and my phone
I would have phone, scarf, and cat plush. I know I know still similar to the original but don't judge me lol
Would have exactly the same but instead of mewo it would be my kitty (her name is Suzy)
First of all, it would be BLUE SPACE. I would then replace the laptop with a gaming pc, and have like an infinite supply of every major chip brand in the UK/US such as Lays, Monster Munch, Cheetos etc. There would be no tissue box and it would just be a bunch of controllers.
Honestly,just put a bed,a bean bag and a desk in there and I'm set
A TV with the channels being literally anything spinning eternally or Nyan Cat, maybe a computer, a mechanical pencil and a shit ton of paper scattered everywhere for venting reasons, and probably a plush of a character that I’ve had an unnecessary obsession over since new years of 2020 - 2021.. . Edit: hell maybe even a sketchbook even though I suck at drawing.
Well we really need to get a toilet somewhere
A lot of pillows, a computer, an mp3 player with headphones, thick blankets, a sketchbook with pencils and a pile of trash
Four mewos.
A Laptop, my bass, and a little golem figurine! Oh and the tissue box stays 
Like 4 backpacks, a bunch of little boxes full of trinkets, a laptop, and a couple of notebooks.
Same thing but the tissue box replace with a blanket.
probably my laptop, a nice blanket, my cat fifi, and a ton of radishes. (i fucking love radishes)
Computer, drawing tablet, sealy the stuffie, and cans of monster energy
My bed, my computer, toilet paper (same use as tissue box, it's just more used in my country) and a plush. Not sure which 
I would have a laptop,  note book, tissue box, and mewo
A blanket, a laptop, headphones, sketchbook, drawing supplies, a cat and some type of drink that contains caffeine (can change between tea/coffee/energy drink)
Color
add my ps4 and we’re set tbh
A bed and a lot of half full water bottles
pc, my cats, pillow, blanket, sketchbook
Mewo, phone, coffee
my laptop, my dog and my bed
Honestly, this ain't a bad setup. I'd be happy
Replace the tissues with a bed, replace the cat with a doggy and the laptop will be upgraded to a computer. Also the light bulb would be a window with natural light coming through, the further you progress and find out more about the truth the more the time transitions outside until it might and white space would become black space.
Bed, blåhaj, gaming laptop and Nintendo Switch console probably ^^;
iPad, switch, mini fridge, and my bunny stripe
Just copy paste my current gaming setup and a bunch of percussion instruments
SKETCHBOOK:. . At the start showing just a few cute anime and Cartoon girls that slowy become more and more abstract.. . E.V.A. DOLLS. . On the last day a doll of SOMETHING would appear there and i would recieve a jumpscare, waking up from the dreamworld, where you would be able to play one part on the real world during night.. . PEARL (MY CAT). . that would give you a quest, only asking you for "box?", If you give her a box, she would enter and give you a reward for it, you could pick the box that would become a healing item, but if you give her the box cutter, she would call you a traitor and run away. . . WINDOW. . On the first day you could see a ocean covering part of the window and it will be on the sunset, "a beutiful view, just sad you don't like the Beach", on the second the ocean would cover half of the window and it would be at night, "you can feel the room getting colder and the smell of salty water entering the room", on the last day the ocean would have covered up the hole window, the glass would break slowy and the water would flood the room, where the character would appear on a new room with water theme, the enemys would be a lot harder after that and you would not be able to get out of the house that day, making your friends enter the house to spend time with you . . IF I COULD ALSO CHANGE THE WEAPON. . Instead of a knife, a box opener (is that the name?), i could change the damage it could deal and the damage i would take acording to how much of the blade is out, if only a little bit of the blade is out, i would have 90% of chance of hitting the enemy and would give 10% more damage, but i would take more damage, if all the blade of the box cutter is out i would have only 55% of chance to hitting and would give 10% less damage to the target, but i would recive 50% less damage, If only half of it is out, i would give and recive the normal amount of damage. . Sorry for the bad English, it's not my first lenguage
Computer, Cat, and shovel, to bury my sins.
Mannequins, crafting supplies, sewing machine, and healing crystals !
mewo, anythimg for music, same notebook laptop and tissue box but there would be like splotches of blue and yellow around and its called splotch space also my cats

The same, but without a lightbulb or mewo and with an ac. The laptop would have a ton of video games and shows on it; Maybe that's how I travel between different headspace worlds
In headspace, I'd either make up imaginary friends or just be alone, as I don't have friends irl
A thick book with my drawings in them, an xbox hooked to a tube tv with a pile of games and cd's around it, a pillow and a calendar.

A gaming PC, a sketchbook (and stuff to draw) a bed I guess? And Mewo.
Computer, my bed, and my trust old, Polaroid SX-70 Onestep.  . . . Oh, and my dog.
My orb. I would have my orb, through it I would look at the real world. I would also have zig zag black and white floor, statue of venus, Saturn table lamp, armchairs to sit on and a suspicious, red curtains. Also my black…I mean white space would allow me to walk in to minds of others.
BB pistol, BBs and a dead lizard

Laptop, piano, photo album (not from omori!! My photos with my actual friends and family), a cat and a tissue box

I would keep everything the same except replacing the laptop with a macbook. Also, imma grab one of my friends to be with me in whitespace bc I don't need the dreamworld. Just being in whitespace is enough
a laptop, a bed, and my plushies just like how my room already is where i sleep like the whole day 😣
Instead of a laptop I'd have a switch or maybe a pc, instead of a sketchbook I'd have a journal with poems, short stories, etc. Instead of a tissue box I'd have a salt rock lamp, and instead of mewo I'd have a ferret named Booger :D or maybe a snake named Luci

Probably a pokeball. Even if I’m isolating from the world I still gotta catch ‘em all.
a noose, a ferret, a broken mirror, and a nintendo 3ds
mewo. just mewo.
Some other cat, a laptop, a sketchbook and pencil, maybe a pillow and some blankets, and a bread knife. Maybe some stress balls? And I can't live without my earplugs because I CAN HEAR THE FUCKING AIR-. . Oh and A TON of empty water bottles and comfy clothes in a pile on the floor
A proper bed, a nightstand with lamp, a desk with laptop, a swivel chair... and it would be black space instead, because I prefer dark mode on everything.
Honestly I think I would have the exact same but instead of tissues put a bed, and replace Mewo with my own cat
if its 4 items for 4 items i'd say my pc, those fancy adjustable dumbbells, bong and uhhh fuck it bring mewo too i suppose
My OMORI plushies, my two cats, a comfortable bed and a laptop
Pet bird, laptop, sketchbook and probably a plant :D
Gaming PC and a Buffet
My dog,my bed,my computer and desk and that's it
a note book with an unfinished drawing, a trash can  filled to the brim with  crumpled up unfinished drawings, a pencil and  pen,  a pc, a   guitar  and  an  aquarium
I would have my girlfriend and multiple things that can wound me
Another mewo
Im not sure but instead of Mewo i would have my dog Taromaru :3
A plushie, a PC and a Switch, my cat and a phone.. And a door leading to Headspace of course >:)

comfi bed, laptop, cat and food :3
mewo, mewo, mewo and mewo
mewo
Everything
Well that's just a bit uninspired
is there a meaning about those things?
iPad with rhythm games and procreate. Chocolate bars. A source of warmth (physically and emotionally). And the light will make the space dark but not pitch black.
Computer, drum set, my dog and my Spotify playlist
a tv, a cd player, a dvd player, every album from every artist i listen to (obviously on a shelf), and my top 100 films (obviously shelved)

Same things, but I'm getting rid of the tissues and dragging in my bed with numerous plushies (Blahaj, Minecraft creeper, and SOMETHING cuddle pile W (and the plush Headspace friend group ofc))
A cat, a computer, and novels.
a nintendo switch, a phone so i can shop for clothes online, my makeup bag and my big bear plushie probably lol . . also a place to nap would be nice ngl
laptop, bass guitar, steam deck, and either my bugs or my snake. snake would probably read better as a drop-in mewo replacement since she's such a darling and there's only one of her.
Mewo, a laptop, a sketchbook, a floor made out of pillows, a nightlight instead of a celling lamp, a pile of Books, maybe a box of crackers and most importantly an incredibox shrine with incredibox-related stuff
I’d just go with my phone, a sketchbook, a pile of my plushies, and my cat
Only reason I’m choosing my phone and not my laptop is because my laptop sucks. Runs on 2 FPS istg
Xbox and and a vr headset and bottles everywhere
Now that I think about it, why does he have that tissue box for?
Laptop, cd player, cd's collection, headphones, books and chessboard
Bag of chips, computer, the newspaper and water

Mewo,Is Sunny alergic a Mewo 🤨
a spas 12, mp5, FN-FiveSeven, Benelli M4, and a laptop and 100 tissue boxes
mewo

. . Listen
it's cool
So what have you learned about sharing internet wumbo today?
I dunno
crayons
I looked that room up because I was about to quit the game if it was gonna force me to kill Mewo. It definitely hit a primal nerve for me.
>!For me it was when the something’s appeared. Especially the dog one. But the Mewo room has destroyed me!<
Yeah, I avoided the Mewo stabbing thing at all costs my first playthrough. I eventually figured out you can stab yourself to skip it. A preferable alternative
Cutting mewo
“Mewo doesn’t know what’s going on”
Scariest was definitely the first real life moment but the one that made me jump the most, and I’m not proud to say this, was the mewo spider that jumps down on the first real life day
>!do you want to cut open mewo?!<. . The watermelon room is a good shock too
Mewo black space 
>!I couldnt stand the mewo room in black space, and also during the truth sequence the room with the instruments and chaotic ambience also made me sick my stomach, every time the piano played that one note when picking up a picture made my heart skip a beat!<
When I needed to kill Mewo. I was so scared, 3 times talked to the guy and then noticed how to exit this place...
It's Mewo!
mewo the cat
People who cut open MEWO
“I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don't expect to be forgiven. I'm simply here to apologise.”
well ok. you are forgiven, just DO NOT THE CAT
This makes it sound like they're doing something else to Mewo 
i thought i had to 😭😭😭😭😭
In the game, you can stab yourself, I don't care about your analogy to mindset of depression, don't touch the fucking cat
Do not the cat
First time i played and i ran around until i figured out i could stab myself instead
Yeah the game reminds you about the other way out only after killing the cat. The fact that the menu is blocked in most of the story sections doesn't help lol
I thought I had to 
I’m sorry ok😭
i thought i had to, cried, then realized i didn’t have to
yeah screw them. i'll do the same to them. mewo is too precious.
I did but only because i thought about it too hard. Every other time I stabbed myself I returned to the real world, but I didnt want to go back yet as I was still exploring so i thought i had to to continue forward.
My homework folder.
mewo nazj
r/ImSorryMewo
One of the RED HANDS is petting MEWO, though... 
I JUST NOTICED THAT
they hang out with mewo :3
lucky motherduckers! i wanna hang out with mewo :(
Mewo
mewo.
Mewo
Mewo
mewo
Mewo
mewo fursuit
Mewo
Mewo. Lol
Mewo.. . 
Tuxedo Mewo!
CUTE LIL BABIE OMOR AND MEWO
...TINY MEWO!!!!!
NO MEWO
>!more like out of presumed necessity since on first look you’d probably assume that cutting open mewo was the only way out of the room!<
>!peer pressured in a way!<
him being a chronic pokémon (red/b/y/g/s/c) player would definitely explain his interest in mewo
You mean he was just testing his new HM?
Why no mewo or hector? I know there's a mewo but why no hector?
Footage of >!Omori cutting open Mewo!< gets leaked
This man would cancel OMORI. . 
but >!Mewo has been very very bad!< though
Nothing official. My interpretation is that >!because Sunny dreams about killing Mewo in Black Space on an operating table, Mewo may have been put down, while Sunny was at the vet, in the room, and it stuck with him!< but hey, that's just a theory
a game theory
Thanks for watching.
And be sure to check out today's sponsor...
RAID SHADOW LE-. . *clicks off, because no one watches the sponsor part of the video*
check comments. . HEY HOW DARE YOU MAKE AN OMORI THEORY
There's a section in my economics class about "game theory" and i dont get why no one else finds it as funny as i do. I am literally studying game theory
Not a bad theory at all.
>!Can you actually kill Mewo there? I just stabbed myself out of that room lol!<
Yup, you can. >!If on the Hikikomori route, Mewo will no longer appear in White Space!<
I stabbed myself to get you of that one too.
I killed mewo…. It was an accident I swear
i didnt even know you could stab yourself 😭😭
Gotta try out every option there is before committing to one :p
You must be living in bless...
Yeah!. . Aside from this game leaving me mentally traumatized in the end anyway, I'm pretty good, thanks!
Atleast you don't have the guilt of killing something innocent that you ended up not having to
>!a lot of people including myself thought it was the only way out and did 😭!<
I've seen plenty worse theories here
You've botched the spoiler tag, there is no space between the >! and !<
sorry, it worked on mobile..
No prob

>!No, nobody really knows for sure. Some think that Sunny killed Mewo, others think that Mewo's staying with Sunny's mom, others think that she just ran away, etc.!<
I think mewo just stayed with Sunny's mom..
Same, this one makes me happy so that's what I go with.
Yeah 
Mewo dripped
"Meow! (Your Jordan's are fake!)"
"Meow? (Waiting for someone to compliment?)"
Meow? (waiting for your mom?)
Meow? (Waiting for your dad to come back? It’s never gonna happen.)
Touchè, my friend. 
Mewo got that drip
You briefly see him outside.
where?
Just on the sidewalk to the left of your house when you're walking back to it. He runs away when he sees you.
Why do they run away?
It could be a hallucination like the fake dream friends in the playground
Judging by the >!Black Space “Cut Open Mewo” room!< probably died due to health complications, or during a surgery
the run n' gun got her
Always the coffee
The reality is that no one knows barely anything about Mewo.. . >!There is no definitive answer over what happened to Her, but one thing is known, and that Sunny very likely did not kill her. While punishment room could imply that he did, it is important to mention that Mewo or any cat appears in Black Space 2. If Sunny were to do something bad to Mewo, it would not just be expected for it to appear in BS2, but it would probably be required.!<. . >!There are currently two leading theories over what happened to her. 1) Killing/Harming Mewo was an intrusive thought that stuck with Sunny due his trauma. 2) Mewo was put down because Sunny’s family didn’t have the resources or time to take care of her.!<. . >!The problem with those theories as that ultimately they both suck ass. While the first is inline with the WS notebook, it does not explain Butler’s symbolism and dual appearance and it also does not explain what actually happens to her. The common consensus is to assume she’s fine either with Sunny’s mom or dad.!<. . >!As for the second theory, while it explains both what happened to Mewo and Butler, it does not explain the notebook properly and it’s generally really weird, like,  even if they didn’t have time to take care of her, surely there would have been a better solution than putting her down? I’m not saying it’s impossible but I do think that at the current context it is overly cruel, including towards Sunny.!<. . >!The general problem is that we can’t decide which one of those theories is correct as there is insufficient evidence. Although if you ask me, I think people are just attempting to solve the wrong thing. Because the fact is that no one knows nothing about Meow herself, heck,  no one even knows what motif she represents or even if she represents one, and even though it is very likely she does, I have not seen or heard any hypothesis on the matter. I believe the true answer lies within what idea does Mewo mean for Sunny, and until Mewo’s symbolism gets solved, we wont reach anywhere.!<. . >!I am almost considering making this comment its own post to perhaps try and raise a discussion relating to Mewo’s motif rather than just what happened to her. If someone has a theory idea, I would love to hear about it!<
I've seen this one, but IRL cats generally get depressed and withdrawn when they experience the loss of a companion.  I've never known a cat to get aggressive, unless Sunny maybe kept trying to pick up and hold Mewo for comfort when she was not about that and he got bit or scratched.  Still, in that scenario, the general rule is to just give the cat more space if it needs it.  I have a hard time thinking Sunny's parents would be terrible enough to jump to that extreme.  Also, the hush puppies are a deserved spooky punishment on the player for making the in-game decision to sacrifice a stray cat who did nothing (you monster).. . BTW, my unpopular twist of this HC is that >!Sunny, in his depression, could have self-harmed and blamed the scars/cuts on Mewo when he got caught - if his mom believed him the wounds may have been bad enough for her to put Mewo down, especially if she doesn't actually know the truth about Mari.  Sunny would have had reason to blame himself for Mewo's death in this case.!<  That is not my own personal HC btw, in fact I kind of hate that I even thought of it.  In my mind, Mewo was simply put down at the vet, she may have gotten into something poisonous ("Mewo has been very, very bad"), or had an unsuccessful surgery (cut open Mewo).  Mewo is significant in the story because she was Sunny's connection to Mari and he misses her dearly (cat shaped hole in neighbor's room).
sunny blamed *the incident* on mewo and mewo was sent away
I literally read a fanfic where mewo masterminded the entire situation
What's the name? I so badly need to read this
I forgot the name. sorry
Nope. It's unknown what happened to Mewo.
She’s with me now
For the love of God STOP STEALING MY CATS
nothing, Mewo is in the house in which Sunny is going to live next
no clue how flawed this is, but my personal thoughts is that >!pets are capable of feeling grief after the loss of an owner. I feel like Mari's death took a toll on Mewo, so she started neglecting personal needs and stuff?!< I unno but thats how i see it 
no idea how >!this would connect with that one room in blackspace. uhh maybe sunny felt guilty that he didnt do enough to help mewo? he was so caught up with mourning mari that he neglected mewo's state as well, so he's convinced he's responsible for her death along with mari's?!<. . bros got some therapy to attend to 😭
In my playthrough I killed Mewo in the punishment area. The next day I saw Mewo on the main road run in the direction of Sunny? The main character's house. I followed but when the next screen loaded he was nowhere in the neighborhood. It's certainly possible that Sunny feels he as good as killed Mewo irl if the cat ran away. Perhaps after Mewo saw what happened to Mari and left for his own safety
I dunno, and I also don’t know if the mewo interaction in 1 day left is real or fake
Since It's possible Sunny's parents divorced, perhaps the dad took mewo with him
Maybe his dad put mewo down because he couldn’t bear seeing something that reminded him of Mari
No one knows. My personal theory is that >!Sunny’s dad took Mewo when he left!<, but there’s no evidence for it. >!It’s possible the Mewo room in Black Space isn’t actually about Mewo though? It could easily be another, more abstract manifestation of Sunny’s guilt over killing Mari, since Mewo was HER kitten.!<
Why are the comments so sad.
What’s black space 2?
You briefly see him outside. It might have just been a memory.
I thought he was just a plush in the picture
Mewo has been very bad
Everyone’s bringing up how the punishment room could connect to mewos disappearance, and I never really considered that very much.. . I always thought the punishment room was about Sunny killing himself as punishment for what he’s done, or being executed.. . But yeah, Sunny probably watched Mewo getting put down.. . Or maybe it was a combination of the two, and Sunny imagining himself in Mewos place.
Would be a little strange for Mewo to be in white space tho
Fair point but it’s white space so nothing can get through. Besides I think it’s the real world that the memories of Mari need to be shut out of not headspace. Besides if Omori ever did have trouble with Mewo in headspace he can just erase her
About that scene w mewo in the “white space”, I think that was an intrusive thought of Sunny. Maybe mewo just ran away or something
Probably chillin
#
>!he definitely killed her!<
Not definitely but it's might be
It's not confirmed
Mewo dipped
Mewo is dead 
idk but this image looks cute
Mewo is a self-insert by omocat, with black fur to fit the theme of the game. I will die on this hill.
Bro died of hunger 💀💀💀
It's a bit dark, but I think Sunny killed it during one of his hallucinations/panic attacks. . . As a way to justify its killing, he tries to convince himself that it was the cat's fault, hence the butler saying "Mewo has been very bad"
i ate her

Bc mewo sharted
TBF besides Mewo (debatable) and Omori (whom already has a ton of merch), Something is kind of the game's mascot. Plus when it's less monstrous and creepy looking, and more like this little black blob thing, its kinda cute
Very true. I wasn't saying that I disliked it.
Mewo
Definitely Mewo
cmon guys, is Mewo
I would love to have the something and mewo plushies
mewo looks like neco coneco with the mini me on his head


its so smooth from the front wow :0. . also i love that gif hehe
MEWO SPIN 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Its the scars from when mewo was *^(very VERY)* bad.
It's actually the ladder stitch to finish the plushie. It's not as strong as the other stitches (normal stitch done with sewing machine, ladder stitch by hand) so it's normal some fibers from the stuffing comes out. I don't actually know how they manufacture plushies exactly, but at least that's how it works with hand sewn ones. Source : I sew plushies as a hobby
Oh, is there any way to fix it then or should I leave it be?
From my knowledge (I am not an expert in any way, so feel free to do however you want), you should just leave it. It seams (hehe pun) fine, and I think removing the little white strands won't really affect the stuffing much since it's so little. At least you can be sure the strands don't come from the seams since they're definitely black, so overall not an issue (in my opinion)
Alright. Thanks a lot! 
If it really starts being too much strands coming out, i recommend you try to find a really narrow open, or chopsticks, something long but narrow to push it back. I made a little drawing to sort of explain how the stitch is made, imagining the fabric is way more "open" than it is rn (I hope I'm being clear enough on what I mean). . 
It's probably dust, some plushies i had did this as well.
Oh and it also may be incorrectly sewed/stuffed so it may do that. To make it stop leaking stuffing you sadly have to cut open mewo.
. . I don't know, but Mewo has been very, very bad. Might as well cut it open and find out. Two birds with one stone.
No, throw it to the lions
O E E ah E O E E E E ah E
Turn this into a gif meme
if you know how to sew, you could see a little with black thread to make it less visible
What?. .  weren't you... waiting for something to happen?
Wish I could buy that.
Give mewo a good bath and im sure it will come out!
Maybe it's a catspider in disguise
*proceeds to summon yonkagor sub* Cause everything seems normal 
Mewo: Let me Break it down for you Mark
this is so cute, i need him too (and mewo)
also i didnt knew you can change nendroid faces, thats cool
There was also a second mewo keychain so I have it to my sister. . She probably has somewhere to put t considering she actually goes to school
Mewo
You're never seeing that Mewo pillow again
Mewo! <3
I need the pixel Mewo
The SOMETHING figure and the MEWO plushie, personally.
Mewo
the mewo at the bottom for sure
mewo plushie+ the picnic stand
All of them, actually.. But especially Mewo
I have that one! The shop is HauntedEclipse and it has the lightbulb and Mewo in Omori's head. .

All of Hakari's settings are thoroughly based on the original work, as that is my style of creating fan content. Of course, as you mentioned, my approach may not convince everyone.However, I strive to add my own interpretations within the framework of the original, as a way to show my utmost respect for the source material. Hakari will continue to be developed in this way, and I can only hope that it resonates with you until the very end.Thank you
Maid something (she’s cute)
Uhh.... 
DO NOT THE CAT
Something: "SHOOT! THEY NOTICED MY SECRET! D:"
Oh god
“Would you like to cut open Mewo?” ahh drawing
Never in my life I was expecting to see SOMETHING with this *"hat thingy"*, idk
I was more focused on the implications of Mewo being on a plate, since, yk…
Ah, yeah...      *ye....*
SOMETHING is just a little cafe entity, be nice 😡
I had to do a lot of homework, so i couldn't check… But i'm happy to see that your AU is rising in Reddit again  Keep going buddy!
Mewo is very, very good
Awww I love ur Mewo so much! Great cosplay both of you
thank you  we share a braincell
MEWO. W
you actually used your cat for mewo that is a W
he’s still a kitten and he just wants to play all the time, but at least i got one blurry picture LOL 
SOO CUTE also mewo
thank you thank you!! 
Tell irl mewo I said pspspspsps
THATS SO COOL!        (Also real Mewo?)
>!So that's what happened to Mewo!<
Don't you mean... Mewochita?
Spoiler tag!!!
Mewochita and Sunji
Now we’res mewochita
Where's mewo >:)
Mewo is a monster, agreed.
Mewo has been very, very bad.
Sadly... no😭 I'm missing the "Defeat all Foes", brushing teeth, homework, and like one other one (I think it's the garbage one or the record one. I haven't looked in a while because I've been playing thr switch version)
Haha, unusual content here! I like it; I have to give you credit for that. The analysis of the topology is spot on — I think this is the most accurate part of the paper. The blackspace topology also sounds plausible.. . However, I have a series of questions and some criticism.. . Why did you introduce the law of universal gravitation in proof one, only to use Newtons law instead? I thought you would be calculating the gravitational constant, but instead you calculated a force applied to Omori. Why? This is just pure speculation.. . Section 2 is very convoluted, especially the time dilation calculation. Why did you use gamma for time dilation? Gamma is already reserved for the Lorentz factor, and you introduced delta t earlier, so why use gamma here? There is also an unknown R factor in the formula itself. What is this? The result of the calculation is very wrong also. If the numerator is 10800 and the denominator is close to 1, how in a world did you get 2.7 \* 10\^-12?. . In the third part, you just listed standard definitions from differential geometry with no actual calculations. You should either remove it or explain what those are for.. . Overall, the paper is based on serious assumptions that would need to be proved individually. This would require at least 10 pages, not to mention the frameworks and definitions that you introduced. I understand that you did it for fun, so stopping where you felt like was probably a right thing to do. Formalism is hard, but it has to be this way, otherwise it's not scientific.
Hey man thanks for checking up on my work! I do thank you for giving me such a complement for most of the work but yeah, we can't deny the fact the mistake I made in notations, implications and many other stuff that you have kindly listed out.. . First, I am planning to make this into series of papers. In this part I have merely calculated the gravitational force acted on Omori but due to inconvenience and further research plan I have decided to leave the two constant at bay.. . As for Lorentz factor I have been using greek letter for a while now and I did mind the fact that It might be similar with Sir Lorentz's notations so I added delta infront of it. Tho it should've been better if I used 'η' than gamma.. I have made alot of notation mistake as I made this today itself with a sleepy baggy eye and adding to that I'm rookie in making papers and publishing them. . Anyhow thanks for noting on my mistakes I'll try my best to make it better in part two.
No problem — this was a good read nonetheless. I'll be checking out your other papers — I'm curious to see what they'll be about.. . When writing papers, just apply a very basic rule: If you're unsure about Something, someone absolutely will point this out. It's also good practice to let an LLM-based system read your paper before you publish it. You'll immediately see if it has misunderstood the context (this part needs rewriting), and it will also point out mistakes in calculations, such as 2.7 \* 10⁻¹² for instance.
With regards to the Mewo room, I didnt have the guts to do it. >!i just stabbed myself and didnt cut the kitty!<
A lot of ppl dont realize thts an option so thts what makes it interesting. If u kill the cat, the exit doesnt emerge. Ppl then talk to the man again who tells you "there was always a way out". . So u basically realize u killed the helpless cat for no reason other than thinking it was your only choice w/o checking all your options :'
I don't think it changes anything if you do it or not.
>!your cat no longer appears and some scenes towards the ending, I didn't kill it and was running around the city later, saying good kitty!<
I killed the cat and it does appear
Game-wise, no.
Because i dont know how to quote things like you did will just press space for all the individual sections. Forgive me >\<. . &#x200B;. . 1: Well idk how close to reality this fiction/story is. But i doubt that not a single figure from the police or hospital wouldnt notice the blood at the back of her head (the kids certainly didnt clean her up if we go by the photos her body had a few stains plus blood on the spot where she fell & blood on the violin as well). . My big assumption is that local authoritys & the parents tried to cover it up that their own Son & Basil killed her + Basil did take that photo of her hanging there.  And i doubt they could jail him at that age. Which would explain why his father left after the argument with his mother. He was disgusted by his own son & his wife for their choices/actions. . . Plus depending on what happend to her body burned or a coffin people doing these sorts of things in graveyards/tending to the corpses before they end up at their final resting place for folks to visit they would notice it as well. What i am trying to say is that Sunny & Basil woulndt be able to cover all their tracks in the middle of the night till the dawn until anyone woke up. At most we can assume he hid his violin but idk how he got rid of the blood stains on the floor etc or the blood on the backside of her head/body. . . 2: I mean yeah that is a option. But in Black Space those memories are things Sunyn tried to reject/forget. So assuming his Dad said that to him & in the context he figured out what happend due the evidence left behind by 2 young boys who acted in the heat of the moment out of desperation. I woulndt disregard the scenario where his parents found out. (Which explains some of the lines of their parents(Shadows in Black Space) argueing with each other over Sunny). . 3: I mean i get what you are saying but in context when it happend aka where that Shadow spoke in response to the other Shadow (Context here matters plus the location) i think its more about the fact his Mother & Dad had a fight about something where he said the line "He is not my son anymore". . &#x200B;. . 4: Yeah that was such a creepy moment seeing that shadow swinging at the tree over and over again with the axe.. . 5: You mean Mari and Sunny relationship? Or Dream Mari\`s persona vs. her true character?. . I am not exactly sure what you refer to here.  I was just referencing the lines from Omori/Sunny that he began to hate/resent playing the violin with Mari instead of hanging out with his friends & Dream Mari apologizing for putting so much pressure on him during their practice but she just wanted to make the play perfect. I still believe he had a strong bond to her but just that he coulndt keep up with her.. . 6&7: Yeah what happend to Mewo is still a mystery to me. Becaue we have to take the Blackspace memories with a grain of salt.. . We saw ho the "something monster" or the spider monster are representations of his fears & guilt. So maybe the Mewo part to get the key was just another fear. But again nobody really talks about the black Cat outside of the dream.. . And in the dream we have 2 majore Cat like creatures. We have Mewo in White Space. We have the yellow cat from the park watching over us waiting for "something same theme with Mewo who also is waiting for something to happen" (as one of the 3 great creatures the other 2 are fucked up and idk what they could represent HIKKIOMORI Route). . Honestly i dont even want to think about him killing Mewo because it hurts so much & its so sad if he really did it. But the worst thing is i dont even understand why he would do it after the thing with Mari.. . The lines in that small room make it clear that it is a conscious/intentional decision & over and over again you are asked if you want to cut Mewo up. Each time we get more and more lines how Mewo reacts. Idk if these details are burned in his memories because of what he did or if its just a really specific nightmare due his guilt over killing Mari.. . We also have to keep in mind Omari hates Sunny aka he hates himself. So it could be the same as Omari stabbing Basil in the black space and shrugging the action away.. . I have zero idears how much we can trust that specific section regarding Mewo.. . But in theory Mewo should be alive. He woulndt be that old aka not even 10 years at that point & only 3 years passed since Mari.. . Maybe someone else will find more infos regarding Mewo. There are several variations of the Neutral Route and even some weird "Cultist Dungeon" ending.. . I am honestly not sure what to make of it.. . &#x200B;. . God this game is a wild ride. Waiting for it was worth it. <3
> 1: Well idk how close to reality this fiction/story is. But i doubt that not a single figure from the police or hospital wouldnt notice the blood at the back of her head (the kids certainly didnt clean her up if we go by the photos her body had a few stains plus blood on the spot where she fell & blood on the violin as well). According to a tanget that a certain youtuber talks about. It is possibly even worse in reality. . A victim with a axe wound on his face was classified as a "suicide".
I 100 % want you to be right about this. Because him killing Mewo is just tooo fucking sad. . . Yet we never see Mewo around or any other news besides the photos & the dream realm. . . Plus the other thing about him throwing up everytime he sees steak/meat dishes. Makes me reallllllly wonder.
I never killed Mewo. I desperately didn’t want to so I was hmmm can I just stab myself? And huzzah! I could!
I was hysterically crying when I killed Mewo and after doing so realized I should have checked if I could just stab myself. I got stuck in the moment and completely forgot to check. That awful awful moment.
Aw :(
Same :(
Literally never had a game make me panic like that
i realized i could stab myself after killing mewo and i felt so guilty i ended up restarting from my last save point to stab myself instead of cutting her open lol
 *''The room where you have to kill Mewo really drives home how many times you have to consciously make the decision to kill her as she slowly realises it and begins to struggle, representing the guilt Sunny feels by causing the death and consciously making the decision to cover it up. The only way to exit the room is to succumb to that guilt and stab yourself (just like in the bad ending). ''* . . Lol U didn't have to kill mewo!!!! You could stab yourself to prevent it from happening. I wanted to do anything BUT hurt little mewo!!

Well look at the votes.....for mewo on the newest post
I think mewo will lose just because of that post in r/basilcult very sad since I was originally in her side. . Maybe a bit of my fault too
They're voting MEWO:(
Sadly
Vote out Mewo!
Mewo will win.
oh thats sweet lmao. . my dad might make me a mewo cake for my birthday 
Aww that’s cute- wait…
>!mewo has been very very bad....!<
. . From Pinterest
we're gonna try to shape it like the mewo in whitespace actually and not >!blackspace!<.. and wont add the text because my dad doesnt know anything about omori (probably only knows that my favorite character is aubrey) and i dont think he'll really like it if the text is added WITH the context..  im not enterly sure though. just wont add the text for safety. 
Fair enough lol, either way that’s amazing, jealous that you get a Mewo cake lmao
yeah, and thats just the start.  due to omori being one of my hyperfixations, my plan is to have some type of omori themed cake for NEXT year too. hopefully i can plan out what it looks like so i can decorate it then.. 



Only if her name is Mewo

The Mewo fandom:
what
In the elimination poll the MEWO fans were against the Plant Boi
mewo
I don't know at which point this track's placement was more of a pun because the text in the box means "We don't kill Mewo (+ a swear)" in French (instead of the "G" letter that should've been there). . other than that I agree with your analysis on the efficiency of that track to drench you in uneasiness, but yeah it's also possible that it's not what their ratings were based off on
Oh I don't know french so I assumed it was cursing the track or smth
the mewo one actually sounds good
In french, the tier name is "YO DON'T KILL MEWO YOU MF"

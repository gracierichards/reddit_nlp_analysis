Mik- The maverick.
Not as sweet as The Maverick though
Wanted to assassinate his dates.
It is a pleasure to date them, but it is an achievement to slaughter.
Domestic terrorist

Woah, didn't expect to see my creation here hehe, it got so many upvotes! (Yes, I am Petrushka from the Omocord, the creator of this gif)

He really did have anime powers
This is the best post I've ever seen

Please capitalize His name.


Every time I see the Maverick (Mikheal) in game I think of this gif and I cackle like an idiot, I love the spies in disguise and the rotoscope is hysterical

THE MAVERICK! 
As THE MAVERICK is shown besting Kel in this artwork, we can confirm that THE MAVERICK is the best OMORI character.
Better idea: Get a wig and cosplay as the Maverick
Theirs a thrid one Bebe/The Maverick
Based ship indeed.
: No Sunny...  . \*transforms into RW Aubrey\*  . : You're not dating Kel... You're dating THE MAVERICK  . The Maverick: MUAHAHAHAHAAA Our love will pierce the heavens! 
biggest plot twist in gaming history
Average The Maverick W
I relate to The Maverick. . 
So you are a Chad?
K Mikhael
The chadverick
So you got beat by a starving kid and a basketball kid?
Happy cake day, The Lord Maverick 
THE MAVERICK: Enough talking, STAB ME NOW!. .  (Stabs). . THE MAVERICK (dies). . : He wasn't worthy enough. Anyone else?. . : N-no, I'm good..
 okay (stab)
 (Gets Made in Heaven)
Nice to see the maverick in a post
Don't you mean ***THE MAVERICK?!?***. . Tch, & you call yourself a ***THE MAVERICK*** main?
IM SO SORRY TOO ****THE CHADVRICK**** I'VE FAILED YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!
Who's maverick? That one kid named Mikhael?
His name is not “”””Mikhael””” it’s THE MAVERICK! Get it right you plebian
There's no need for me to call it another name... Mikhael is already cool
Kid named Mikhael:
Thank you for not dead naming Mikhael
Ah yes, "thank you for not deadnaming *deadname *" /j
Naturally
This (correctly) implies that The Maverick is also gay.
The Maverick is beyond sexuality, he simply is
There is nobody not attracted to *THE MAVERICK* so we cant say for sure
*THE maverick
Sorry, I mean Maverickroll

Sorry mikhael, still not calling you that
wow just straight up deadnamed him like that
What? Mikhael is not THE maverick nor is he A maverick, from what I heard top gun: maverick sucks so it's actually better to dead name him
Stop trying to justify your Mavriphobia. It's 2022, no excuses for that.
And you stop trying to justify your mavriphillia, its 2022, no excuses for that

Logan Paul as The Maverick has LAYERS.
Don't care, no Maverick plush
It's THE MAVERICK
I wasn't the only one thinking about the Maverick plushy!
okay but how does THE MAVERICK taste?
Bread, no matter how much he denies it.
Ohooooo
You can’t eat the maverick you’d be dead before he gives you the chance
Metal
Taste like nylon
\*insert obscure reference here\* is how he tastes.
The Maverick the type of guy to scream for 10 minutes to pad out an episode’s runtime
Man that sucks, I want to buy the maverick one
I want the Maverick one desperately.
I read "I AM THE MAVERICK" as "I AM THE MAYONAISE"
"The Maverick? I abandoned that name a long time ago Kel,now you must refer to me as ***THE MAYONNAISE***"
And no, I am NOT an instrument!
but he is instrumental to me 
Damn, people really simping over tha Mayonnaise? I can get behind that, tho.
DAMN I WANT THE MAVERICK SHIRT
I would’ve gotten that Maverick shirt
I would too
and that's when I told u/j0shfour, it's not MAVERICK, it's **THE MAVERICK**
i would soooo buy that THE MAVERICK shirt
dude i unironically wanted the maverick one fuck the manager
best haiku ive ever heard
Agreed
I want the Maverick one as well, he is one of my favorite characters
NOOOO BUT I WOULD BUY THE MAVERICK SHIRT SO FAST
SAME
SAME
I want the Mikhael one so bad
You mean The Maverick?
I like using his second name to spite him, out of love❤️
I want the MAVERICK! Shirt 😭
i would use THE MAVERICK one everywhere.
I would’ve gave up my entire life savings for a maverick shirt
I would have bought the fuck out of those. Especially The Maverick shirt.
I would do unspeakable things for the maverick shirt
Crying bc I was thinking she was gonna do April fools merch but now I’m sad 😭😭😭 please give me the maverick shirt
Noooooooo my maverick shirt
The Maverick is not pleased.
Strong agree to all of this. They are very underrated to the point of being non existent despite being the main real world side characters. I still want Maverick plush thing.
THE MAVERICK
Instant reply what the fuck is this treachery.
😎
The Maverick?
Correct!
Nvm the Maverick
...the Maverick? Lmao
Good but no it’s sweet heart :b
Oh yeah lol gg
Maverick
maverick activities
I think it's because THE Maverick was louder compared to everyone and constantly got in trouble at school.
THE funky monkey
acts? THE MAVERICK *is* the main character!
Probably because of how chaotic ~○°☆THE MAVERICK☆°○~ was
He is insanely powerful chaotic character.
Maybe he knew the twins better than the maverick, at 12 he might only occasionally see him but maybe he went with his mom to the bakery regularly or something
...I mean have you seen the irl Maverick and his siblings
This proves that the Maverick is an evil vampire that’s trying to kill an entire bloodline and take over the world
SAIYAN MONKEY!!!. . That would explain the Maverick high power level.
THE MAVERICK
THE MAVERICK has no aliases STFU
Honestly, seeing most of Mikhael's house. How can one family be THAT OBSESSED with Christianity? It's creepy as shit.
Sunny and Mari Hidaka  . Kellan and Henry Aguilar  . Aubrey Williams  . Basil Louloúdi. . Kim Lee-Park  . Vance Lee-Park  . Angel Samuels  . Mikhael "The Maverick" Baker  . Charlene Garnier
He robbed The Maverick during the fight 
"They're shitty kids..". . **has a the maverick flair**
Ah, but he's not a kid, he's ***the MAVERICK***
true
And?....
THE MAVERICK
This the real answer
THE MAVERICK!!11!1!!!
THE MAVRIK!!!!11!1!!!!!11!1!!!! 
The best response if you have dark hair because the blond wig is already canon 
His likeness is impossible to accurately capture
THE MAVERICK
THE MAVERICK
Something my friend said about MIK- I mean THE MAVERICK was that one hair on his chest was permanent marker
I wouldn't put it past him.
. nah lowkey he would be hilarious irl
Yeah I can agree with that one 
I wanna change my awnser now
Real
THE MAVERICK is my favorite character in the game...even though I feel like if he were a classmate of mine I'd really dislike him.
The Maverick, if he was real, i would bend his shins over a playground swing
The Maverick I think I don't have to explain anithing 
Sunny cosplaying as the maverick and kissing passionately The Maverick
Ughhh, you monster, thats worse

Source: [Angel dressing like he from Colorado.](). . Anyway what do you think of Angel? He is the Maverick's loyal servant and seems to look up to him. Do you feel Angel is rarely if ever talked about?. . His hair is pointy long and curly looking like the Fonz from Happy Days show. He wears orange shorts and light blue tank with wings on it.
Bro the source links to the shadiest site 
Oh snap. I got it from mobile and not sure if it really messed up on desktop. I am required by law to post some source.. . Edit: I changed it up and hope that works better.
Just find their Twitter acc. Same art there. (Huge neon scented art fan, they make adorable bread sibling art and mercy and I love them)
Yes I seen the adorable bread people art. "Oh, so we're bread people now?!" It is very well done and glad I came across it.
WHat site was it originally?
Idk it was some alternative to viewing Tumblr, but it had a shit ton of pop ups
Oh
angel is the best because he is a LOYAL servant to THE MAVERICK and makes him an amazing character
my headcanons:. . 1. (serious) he's the youngest of the group. maybe 2 years older than Mikhael. . 2.(less serious) he's actually named Ben, or some variation, hence him being named Neb in headspace
i will adopt him as my son. i will feed him and give him water and shelter him and love him and raise him as my own
I can clearly see someone saying Ángel Is a jojo-referencia
Id kill someone for The Maverick plushie
You probably should have like say $100 saved in the future to make sure you not have to do that. Surely it not cost more than that.
Whats the fun in that though?
DID SOMEONE SAY MAVERICK PLUSHIE??. . Man, I even drew concepts awhile back, I am starved for official mav content
I need The Maverick Merch 
YESS THE MAVERICK STUDENTS SHOULD BE HELD IN HIGH REGARD
You dare insult the one true successor to THE MAVERICK? My brother in christ he can literally teleport in the real world
He's cringe and can't even write properly 
He's like 11
And? 
It's good art for someone that age
It's still cringe, just like Mikhael 
You have made a grave mistake, friend 
I don't care if he or I will die, I'm fine with it either way 
Then go ahead and perish then! **Teleports behind you and does a karate chop on you**
Finally I'm dead 
(No problem!) 
Angel writes like that on purpose to encrypt his notes for The Maverick.
Ah yes, a secret code for the Anonymous Idiots Club 
You wouldn't really know though because Angel encrypted it.
I don't need to know because literally everyone can read "the code" he wrote for Mikhael 
Yes of course they can read it. That was the decoy code. Also I am pretty sure Angel wrote it for THE MAVERICK.
Nah, he wrote it for Mikhael 
You are insulting Angel's Master. You do realize that The Maverick is Angel's trainer? The same guy who was only using a fraction of his power against Kel. That means Angel is very powerful. Do you not fear Angel like you fear The Maverick himself?
Nah, his name is Mikhael. I don't fear either of them 
Do you see a Mikhael user flair anywhere? No cause that is not a thing.
Yet the emoji on your flair is named Mikhael. 
I will have to check that one day because that would be wrong to use the incorrect name for THE MAVERICK.
I can already see how you'll deny it because people with Mikhael flair are the best at coping 
But there is no Mikhael flair. Are you jealous because you are not The Maverick? It makes sense. You probably wish you could be Angel to be closer to The Maverick himself. It's okay to be jealous of such a legend like The Maverick. Not everyone can be The Maverick.
Why would I be jealous of Mikhael? I don't need to pay people to hang out with me 
Why would you not be jealous of The Maverick? Also those ladies needed lunch money and The Maverick being the kind gentleman that he is gave them lunch money and asked them to witness him take down Kel, but the ladies were too intimidated by his enormous power level and left for their own safety.. . Cabba: Anyway, this was fun. I gotta bounce.
AAHHH! I just checked and the emoji says Mikhael on website! I can not believe you are correct! 
Embrace the truth! 
Holy shit Sigma getting downvoted  That’s a first
Not the first time I was downvoted for truth, even on this subreddit.
Disappointing but not surprising 
I am going to tell the Maverick what you said and he going to beat you up for talking smack about his loyal servant. It going to be broadcast live on tv and online. I am not serious about this in case you are freaking out crying on the floor.. . There, wipe your tears away. Angel will beat you up instead! Wuhahaha! Not serious about that either. Isn't this fun?!
The least coping Mikhael flair be like
Silly Kel flair user, you spelled The Maverick wrong.
Seethe 
It's okay. I am not seething because you can not spell The Maverick's real name. I bet Angel can teach you.
You're not seething.  . You're malding. 
I had to look that up. Apparently means bald and mad or so mad you go bald. Since you taught me a new word, I will teach you a new word. I will use it in a sentence. People who call Angel cringe will be defenestrated by Angel himself.
Defenestrating doesn't equal to pissing pants from anger like Angel will do because I'm calling him cringe 
That's not anger. That's exercise. If you are peeing yourself, then your defenestration workout is too intense.
Mikhael fans trying to explain how them pissing themselves is "exercise"  . . . 
Those Mikhael people sound crazy. Good thing I stick with the Maverick gang.
You can cope all you want, but you are sticking with Mikhael gang 
There is no Mikhael. Only THE MAVERICK who we all want to get plushy of when it happens one day.
I'd buy it just to write "Mikhael" on it, so everyone knows his actual name 
I think angel is probably THE MAVERICKS!!!!! apprentice.
Meh, I like THE MAVERICK more.
Headcannon:. . Ángel Is from USA. . Mikhael Is italian. . Charlene Is… idk. . Kim Is from USA. . Vance Is also from USA
Probably THE MAVERICK OH YEAH
I NEED THE SELLER LINK. I WANNA MAKE A THE MAVERICK ONE
You kinda looks like the maverick

THANK YOU
THE Maverick********

Sweet sassafras, it’s Top Gun: Maverick
My god, this guy is themaverickmaxxing right now.
OMG THE MAVERICK?!?
Woah! It's The Maverick!
OMG ITS THE MAVERICK!! I’M YOUR BIGGEST FAN 😻
maverick satoru
THE MAVERICK
Holy crap its Mikael
Best The Maverick cosplay I've seen in my life
Hello MIKEAL
THE MAVERICCCCKKK THE MAVERICK IS REEEALLLL! (Can we get much higher?)
THE MAVERICK!!!
THE MAVERICK uuh I mean MIKHAEL 😁
I thought this was going to be ✨THE MAVERICK✨ with brown hair!
Oh no, it's Mikhael... Again... . . 1: In fact, not much!! I have the can since my birthday, January. But I ordered the clothes 2 weeks ago and already had time to set up everything!. . 2: I wanted to get the haircut, but I got afraid it wouldn't suit me so I didn't. I struggled so so so bad to find the trainers (it didn't help that I'm bad at searching, I'm not even english). In fact, I asked Reddit. . 3: Decathlon!! (Mine's are Joma's) They're rare but not that much, I found it without trouble
OO THERE IS NO MIKHAEL! Only the perfection that is ✨THE MAVERICK!✨. . You been planning this for some time and glad you was able to find the shoes. I think you're like the 6th or 7th Kel I seen on here. I seen Aubrey, Basil, Hero, Kel, Mari, The Maverick, Omori, Rococo, Sunny, and Sweetheart from memory.. . I personally would like to try obviously the Maverick or Kel.
Yeah, yeah, whatever Maberick . . Oh, I don't think I've seen any The Maverick or Rococo, but yeah, Omori cosplays are so cool!! I've been seeing many Kel cosplays so I get an idea of how people usually do it. . If you ever try to cosplay, good luck! Plz @ me, and DM me if you wanna ask smth or whatever, it'll be alright!
*The Maverick
THE MAVERICK*
My head meat exploded with happiness when I saw the maverick
The fact that your brother looks really stylish with Mikhael’s outfit just makes me realize that ditching his wig us all he would’ve needed to do to actually look cool lol
Fr
And then I told him… It’s not Maverick… It’s THE Maverick !
Berdly x The Maverick
Yeah, maybe >!mikhael!< said it when they were 12 because we know he's been using the wig since that time (his headspace version is blonde)
Hm, that works
It's one of >!"THE MAVERICK"!< tips in his mirror
and mikael was turned into an animal. can you guess which one?
The Maverick: It's THE MAVERICK. Yes, how dare he turn me into a monkey!
Takes place in China. Idk just gives me China vibes, lol. Also Mikhael talks in a different voice to sound cool when he's being The Maverick (TM)
THE MAVERICK runs a drug operation...
Breaking bad
More like breaking bread am I right?
finally someone refers to the king as his world renowned name
. . >!*feeling cute, might destroy “The Maverick’s” drug empire*!<
YES!
Maveruh, we have to go maveruh
Aubrey and Kim are definitely both bullies. We even see a little bit of it in headspace, Berly has some bullying tendencies already when they were kids.. . Maverick and Angel I think get caught up in it. They’re not inherently bullies, but Maverick isn’t against it and Angel probably doesn’t even understand he’s hurting people, he’s such a bonehead.. . Vance and Charlie are just there and get dragged in. Vance mostly does it to stay in Kim’s good graces, his heart never seems to be in it at any point. Charlie’s just… kinda there.
Kim/Berly in Slytherin, Van/Vance in Hufflepuff, Maverick/Mikhael and Angel in Slytherin, Charlie/Sharleen in Hufflepuff, etc.
THE MAVERICK
THE MAVERICK!?
ITS ME THEEEEE MAVERICK
every character in faraway town desperately needs a hug(exept for the maverick)
How DARE YOU
he is perfect he doesnt need anything
LIKE THE MAVERICK
Mikhail, calm down, you almost lost your wig.
He also turns The Maverick into a monkey in his dream world. One of the few people in Faraway Town with a darker skin tone.
I read this in THE MAVERICK’s voice. My friend gives him kind of a Slavic accent lol
Nah it’s rated M for THE MAVERICK
FUCK YEAH! THE MAVERICK!
WOOOO! THE MAVERICK!
OH YEAH! THE MAVERICK!
DID SOMEONE SAY, THE MAVERICK?!
YEA, THE MAVERICK!
MAVERICK SWEEP
No, that would be rated TM.
STOP RUINING OUR FUN 
\*Micheal 
mikhael\*
also u are the maverick heh i love him he's cool you have taste
The Maverick is the second best Character in Omori only behind Kel
THANK YOU. . There is something so loveable about The Maverick, whether it be his endearing try hard cool guy persona- the blond wig- his brother and sister too. i just find him so endearing for a side character.. . also kel ofc best boy
THE MAVERICK teleports to E8 with his mystical powers (of god and anime)
The maverick fucking explodes
dude the maverick gagnam style XD LOLZ doge trollface
“Yeah… maverick ”

Still would be faster than Mikhael

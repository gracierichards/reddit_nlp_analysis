When the sprout mole is sus
the official sprout mole sticker pack has sir maximus I, II, and III
Why couldn’t we bring the sprout moles home to the village and make them unlost anyway?
Sprout moles gonna be sprout moles.. . Such is the way of life.. . 
Sprout Mole spotted
r/foundthesproutmole
Sprout Mole Mike is the only reliable source of information. I get all my news from Sprout Mole Mike!
medals with sprout mole faces are the only thing i need to survive.
quick, start searching for sprout mole plush
Yes!!!!
Dont worry I wont it'll probably be a sprout mole's or smth
Sweetheart*. Sprout Moles don’t have necks.
Oh
Do sprout moles even have necks?
Holy wow I love this. I would kill to see more. Especially if it includes more sprout mole violence. God, fuck those guys
That sprout mole is going through eternal hell
sprout mole
sprout mole brand tofu
Omg yes I can completely envision that! 10/10 would buy for some tofu salads
my favorite part of Omorbius was when Omorbi said "It's omorbin' time" and omorbed all over those sprout moles
real
My favorite part of Gammastone is when Chris Pratt and Barney the dinosaur run into Spam mail G. Spam mail
sprout moles
...Are you a sprout mole that was sent to the dungeon and is serving time? . . If so I hope by the 1300 hours, they finally release you, hang in there 👊
i actually loved the castle tbh . it was hilarious seeing the sprout moles gush over her
How are so many of you guys getting moderated 😭😭. Actually I don't blame you fellow sprout moles...
Whole Lotta sprout moles in the comments
Let's solve this crime together. How do you think this sprout mole died? how did the culprit do that? who is the culprit?
My mind can’t make up its mind on whether this sounds like Ace Attorney or Danganronpa
Since they try to kill you shortly after, danganronpa
Will you make the right choice or the dreadfully wrong one
puhuhuhu
Same lol
Among us

Imposter
Impostor*

"Stop, Imposters!" . -Sir Maximus
*insert Danganronpa theme here*
Oh no.... . I'm instantly reminded of the Danganronpa subreddit.
Cluedo, probably. With cause of death instead of location
Sweetheart is to blame. She’s probably forcing those sprout moles to stand there for weeks on end, and she might’ve forgotten to feed this one.
Obviously Laundry Overdose
heart attack
well, it could be never alive
It is simple really. Sprout mole see sweetheart, sweetheart excite sprout mole, sprout mole die of heart failure.
It was me. I did it like this: *shoots sprout mole*
brazil
the guy who hates bunnies took a gun and attempted to kill a bunny but his sprout mole friend jumped in front of the bullet
They died of a stroke
Natural Causes?
died of excitement
I was gonna say that
great minds think alike
I don't know, maybe there's an **impostor among us**
~~Get out of my head~~
Something in the Vents
A-a MURDER? On MY Owl Express!?
Myurdur
I can't believe someone would *myurrderr* one of the Express Sprout Moles. And that it was your uncle's sister.
What do you have to say for yourself?
Oh, yer givin' me the quiet treatment, eh? That's what a *myurrrrrderrrrrerrrrr* would do.
a hat in time reference??? on MY omori subreddit???. . . wow great job i am happy about this
I was seeing how all the comments would either reference Danganronpa or Ace Attorney, and I wanted something similar so I was wondering what would be a clever reference to some other underrated game.. . ***And then I remembered the smuggiest character in all fiction: Hat Kid.***
I like to think this is a direct reference to >!one of those True Sequences. The one with hospital beds and some unnamed people on them. Chairs and Sprout moles could be patients and Sprout mole that is dead could be that one patient who is not breathing (anymore) after collecting all the photos in that area.!<
>!This sprout mole is not breathing.!<
I was thinking exactly the same thing!
>! [This sprout mole is not breathing.] !<
Remove the spaces
Spoiler tags don't work if there are spaces between the ! and the []. . Edit: New Reddit might render it anyway but old reddit doesn't
On my end the spoiler marks aren’t there.
they are
It's working for me.
Most of those Sprout Moles gave up something significant to have a ticket to be there. This Mole likely sold their own organs and died while waiting for the show to begin.. . Dark humour, ladies and gents and everything in between
simped too hard 😔
He didin’t drink orange joe
He did*
I’m at this point in my current run and I realized it was weird that there was a dead sprout mole there. it seems like something that would directly connect to a quest, but it just doesn’t
There'd be no quest if the quest giver is dead
that is true! I was thinking more along the lines of another sprout mole asking where this one went, and then you having to break the bad news, or something less sad than thst
Stopped breathing
I'm pretty sure it's just a joke about how long the Moles have been waiting for the show to start, that one of them straight-up just died in his seat. I don't think it's any more than that.
(Sweet)heart attack
Squid Games
‼️
Could be a sprout mole we killed
It fell off of king crawler
Stopped living
Propablly died from waiting
how do you know it died here? it merely says it's not alive. perhaps its corpse was dragged to the show.
They died from the anticipation
I remember this on my playthrough, had a good small laugh here.
When. . When the. . When there’s. . When there’s a killer *among us*
He overdosed on tofu n died of a sprout heart atack
No worries he’s just talking about the chair
Sat for too long so a clot formed
skill issue
Report the dead sprout mole
It was the favorite Sprout Mole of >!Mari!<
He died from waiting for the show to start after arriving three weeks earlier
Plushie aint alive too, so
Sprout moles are so fragile they'd probably die if you breathe on it too hard anyways.
A body has been discovered!
heart attack cause by excitement,case closed.

I Think It Had A Stroke Or Seizure .

You know what omori hates? sprout moles and sweet heart two darker skinned characters he has absolutely no remorse hating hes definitely racist

Then Tussle Among Trees should be after Trees... When you confront lost sprout mole and before A Home For Flower when fighting Ye old sprout. Either it's trolling or a tracklist mistake
Oh yeah, haven't played the game since it came out so I thought Tussle came after Acrophobia. It's probably just a mistake in it's order as I think everything else is ordered by when you hear it in game, either that or Omo was feeling quite mischievous the day she uploaded these

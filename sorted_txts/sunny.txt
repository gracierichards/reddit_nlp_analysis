My headcanon is that Sunny makes the OMORI game himself after becoming a gamedev
Does that mean Sunny is OMOCAT (or at least one of the people behind it)?
Yeah it would. . And the 6 year delay would be because of Sunny having to face those memories again and the guilt coming back partially
My headcanon is that all the events of the game actually happened exactly as they were written, and now we're all very very sad and trying to cope with memes and barely viable AUs
The one true headcanon
Suddenly Danganronpa.
"Sunny why are you doing this to me."
the one constant in the timelines is >!sunny loses his eye!<
Sunny's shirt is totally not concerning whatsoever. "we live in a society" vibes
\-> Sunny, wake up, Sunny! What do you mean, dream world? Stairs? Drowning? Come on, that performance we had yesterday was amazing! Let's go treat ourselves to a pizza!
>!Why you covering that eye, SUNNY?!<
I have never had the anxiety I did trying to buy this merch. . &#x200B;. . but I got my boi Sunny's shirt and a poster so I am beyond stoked
Sunny casually stands with a shirt on of him ripping his face off as he stands between at leans one of his childhood crushes
sunny? more like sussy (edit: i know this is anout headspace, and?). omori? more like omogus 😤
Back for round three, pale boy . . -Lake drowner of Sunny
Hope you’re prepared for this to be canon, ball boy. . -Lake, Ruler of H2O
Prepare to meet your sister you malnourished child. . -Lake, keeper of that statue
Oh yeah? How about i read you a sad poem, so then i could prove water is wet?. . -Malnourished child
Water is actually not wet; It makes other materials/objects wet. Wetness is the state of a non-liquid when a liquid adheres to, and/or permeates its substance while maintaining chemically distinct structures. So if we say something is wet we mean the liquid is sticking to the object.. . &nbsp;. . What kind of rocks are never under water?. . Dry ones!
Fuck you. . -Sunny
SUNNY becomes STRESSED OUT!
Calm Down
>!You tried to calm down but your lungs fought to breathe.!<
>!The line makes a lot more literal sense since you can’t breathe underwater!<
Your lungs remember to breath, you take a deep breath. . Unfortunately, your 15 feet underwater and just got yourself killed
Sunny: **"since when did I make so much bunnies?..."**
Bunny sunny
Red determination = Omori/Sunny: >!Omori will not succumb!!! But Sunny doesn't quit when prompted to give up either in the true route.!<. . Green Kindness = Hero: >!Hero is super nice in the story. He wants to be there for his friends which is why it's all the more shocking when he lashes out at Kel. Still, that's not enough to change who I believe he is.!<. . Orange Bravery = Kel: >!Athletic and confronting your friend or trying to contact them and get them out of their isolation is something to be commended.!<. . Blue Integrity = Mari: >!She wants sunny to move forward and is even honest about her flaws when the dream world isn't. Admitting she pushed sunny too hard shows some form of integrity.!<. . Light Blue Patience = Basil:>!For better or for worse he waited 4 years for sunny to confront the truth. Plus in the dreamworld admits to not being a good fighter and patience in undertale is the first to die so sorry Basil.!<. . Yellow Justice = Aubrey: >!Or what she believes is justice. She lashes out at her friends because she believes they have wronged her in some way when all of them were coping with Mari's death in different ways.!<. . Purple Perseverance = Something:>!It still wants sunny to be better and will continue to follow him until he either cedes his identity, Accepts Mari's death, or dies.!<
Purple should be OMORI. . Determined to the end to keep the truth repressed, knowing no limits and even threatening to kill Sunny when he obstructs that goal
>Determined. . Hence why he’s Determination, along with Sunny.
Frisk/chara = Sunny/OMORI
very accurate in my opinion.
Sunny has Persevered through alot. He's not really determined, he just perseveres through hardship.
yeah, sunny pushed mari down the stairs and she died, basil was there and helped sunny stage it as a suicide
use spoilers
> I don't see any room for improvement of either Hero's or Sunny's conditions.. . Hero: Hes using sublimation as his coping mechanism. Like hes a textbook example of it. He will continue doing that, I cant see him holding true resentment towards Basil and Sunny.. . Sunny: this guy is messed up big time psychiatrically. He has full blown dissociative fugue going on. Gets better at the end but I cant see him fully recovering from this.
>sunny been a hikikomori. . english please
A shut in, its from were the game got its name from
Sunny was 12.
It may be just me, but I feel like whether or not Sunny's friends choose to forgive him is not the point of the ending. It's a little misleading because up until that point, the game is framed as reconnecting with your old friends, but I feel like the last portion of the game is all about forgiving yourself and overcoming your own guilt - admitting the truth, coming clean to those around you, is the first step in healing from the trauma that Sunny went through after Mari's death. I don't think his friends would forgive him personally - it's not the most positive ending - but it's hopeful. Sunny can finally begin healing and overcoming.
> It may be just me, but I feel like whether or not Sunny's friends choose to forgive him is not the point of the ending. . I mean, the crux of the entire Omori fight WAS whether or not his friends would actually forgive him for his actions. If that wasn't the point of the ending then it seems silly to make it the focus of what is ostensibly the climax of the entire story. If his friends didn't end up forgiving him, then the conclusion drawn is that Omori was right, because they were the one suggesting such.
Yeah, but from a personal standpoint I don’t think it matters. Sunny’s fears about whether or not his friends would forgive him was keeping him from coming clean and finally being able to overcome and heal from that traumatic event. In the end, he overcomes those fears - He doesn’t know if his friends will forgive him, but he admits to his mistakes anyway, which allows him to begin the process of overcoming his guilt and accepting what happened instead of the outright denial of the dream-world.. . It is not a blanket positive ending, but I feel like the take of “My friends definitely wont forgive me, so I should never come clean or accept the reality of what happened and try to finally move on with my life” doesnt really make a lot of sense.. . It’s a happy ending for Sunny, if bittersweet. It’s a happy ending for Basil too. You can literally see the physical manifestations of their guilt and anxiety dissipate after Sunny admits what happened - they have finally begun the healing process.
Plus, it’s not like any of them have to see Sunny anymore. He’s outta there.
They were scared kids who didn’t want to be blamed for murder. They did the only thing they could think of at the time to absolve themselves of the crime. The one piece of evidence that couldn’t be cleaned up easily, the violin, was locked away. Somehow, this terrible plan worked out for them, so both Sunny and Basil had to carry that guilt in silence. In Sunny’s case, he locked himself in his house for years and stopped talking all together, at least until the last scene of the good ending. . . No one has committed the same actions as Sunny, but I don’t think that means he can’t be related to. Have you ever made a big mistake that you had to hide from everyone? Have you told a lie that you’ve had to keep for years? Have you kept a secret that you feel you’ll have to keep to your grave? These experiences come with similar feelings of guilt and despair and I think many can see that in themselves, when going through Sunny’s story. . . Even if you can’t relate to Sunny, I still think you can put yourself in Sunny’s shoes. I felt genuinely conflicted on telling the truth to Sunny’s friends. I wasn’t sure whether or not it was fair to burden them with knowledge in order to help save Sunny, but the game itself gives a pretty convincing argument to forgive and move on. I think it’s interesting how the good ending of the game tests not only the morals of Sunny, but also the players. Maybe you have a different interpretation though and that’s totally fair, but to me discovering what happened the night Mari died was when everything clicked together.
I think they would for several reasons.. . 1. It was just an accident, Sunny never meant to kill Mari. They all know how much Sunny loved Mari.. 2. He and Basil were only like 12, didn't know any better and was afraid of punishments.. 3. Hero said something like "this time we'll be here for each other when we need it".. 4. They know how much suffering Sunny has been through already, locking himself away for 4 years.. 5. Aubrey almost killed Basil.. 6. Hero might be relieved that Mari didn't commit suicide after all. 7. It's been 4 years. They've all had time to heal and mature. Hero is far more mature in the first place.. 8. Knowing what really happened doesn't change the fact that she died.. 9. It takes alot of courage for Sunny to admit something like that.. . Or maybe I'm just incredibly high on Copium.
They went through so much just to get their group back together and finally trust each other. I think they'd forgive Sunny. Not forgiving would imply they hadn't healed at all. Honestly I feel like the truth would give a lot of closure. Aubrey didn't understand why basil and sunny became closed off, now she does. They now know that she didn't commit suicide so hero would no longer blame himself for thinking he wasn't there for her. Basil and Sunny would now have a weight off their shoulders and be able to truly heal. It's also not like it was on purpose, the whole thing was an accident. Shutting Basil and Sunny out would solve nothing and only result in more pain for everyone.
I feel Aubrey would, if only because she nearly killed Basil on accident in a nearly identical way, and I feel Kel would, because he’s just too innocent and kind to hold it against Sunny for long.. . I think Hero would try to be compassionate, and would try to forgive Sunny for what he did, but I don’t think he could ever fully forgive him, because for the longest time, HERO thought he drove Mari to suicide, and struggled with that fact. Hearing that it was Sunny who killed her, and Basil who staged the Hanging, I don’t think he could ever forgive either of them.
Well that’s okay isn’t it? They deserve to know and Sunny doesn’t deserve a lifetime of guilt looming over him. If they hate him that’s their choice to make. I think there is a reason that the player sees their reaction. No matter what happens, telling the truth is better than succumbing to that overwhelming guilt.
well it's more about sunny forgiving himself than anything. life will never get back to where it was. entire game is sad af but at least with the truth out sunny is at a place where he can start to \live life\ again
I do enjoy thinking about your point of view, but I was joking. Framing sunny as the bad guy is entertaining for someone who knows people who've gone through (relatively) similar circumstances, as they never turn out to be an intentionally bad person. 'Course, I don't believe the word bad is meant to be used as a description of anything besides inanimate objects and human actions. Anyway, I framed sunny because it was funny. with the experience I have, a person who can't tell if they meant to kill someone usually didn't mean to kill someone.
I would. Sunny was 12.
... Good thing Sunny knows Persist, huh
SUNNY used PERSIST. . Hero:. bro what the fuck you literally have a crack in your skull.
Sunny is built different
That's a good point but I don't think Sunny changed all that much. That was part of the idea of whitespace. He changed enough to start forgiving himself but for the past 4 years he'd been at pretty much a developmental standstill.
Sunny is an unreliable narrator.. . That was quite literally just him hyping himself up to deal by using the most sympathetic ideas of his own friends.. . Honestly, Sunny probably is a bad person. He isn't a fucking psychopath, but damn.
I wanna agree but I don't agree that Sunny is a bad person. This entire game and the dream world literally shows you that. If you've seen the transcript for what happened on the day of Mari's death, you'll know it was an accident and he didn't even mean to hurt Mari. Covering it up as a suicide was really fucked up but they were kids. They're still kids. And being meta here, we technically aren't being told the story by Sunny. It's the devs telling the story- so they try and use as much symbolism or other artistic shit to tell us how things are.
I agree that Hero wouldn't actually attack Sunny, but we've seen that he bottles up his anger, and when it comes out it comes out HARD. I imagine he would briefly fantasize about doing this, immediately be disgusted with himself for thinking of doing such a thing, and ultimately just leave and not talk to Sunny or Basil for as long as possible for fear of flipping out at them.
I’m dying and so is Sunny
I know this is a joke and I laughed but also a after thinking about it a lot, based on my interpretation of the characters, I actually think that Hero would initially be the kindest to Sunny. Lemme explain: . . Kel would be the most understanding and quick to forgive and have faith and believe that Sunny is a good person and it was an accident. He would probably initially be in the shock though and not know what to do and need a bit of time to process. . . Aubrey might storm off in rage and tears, but eventually come to understand it was a tragic accident. She may never forgive Sunny or talk to him again but she would understand it was an accident. Maybe with a lot of pushing from Kel she may eventually come around to trying to slowly forgive him. But it would certainly never be the same. . . Finally Hero. I truly don’t think he’d be as angry as so many people seem to think. I think he would initially be in complete shock and bewilderment, and his first instinct would be to comfort Sunny while his mind is spinning from the info. But afterwards, as much as he tries to be understanding, I think he’d definitely have a growing resentment. But as others have said, at the same time it’s almost like a weight lifted - to know her death was an accident and that he didn’t fail her by not seeing the signs. I think he’d try to continue a strained friendship, probably mostly encouraged by Kel . . That’s just my opinion tho~ if anyone wants to discuss I’d be happy to
This is honestly probably how it would turn out unless Sunny made a really good speech about what he’d done that’s moving enough for them to at least not try to murder him
bruuuh why is there almost no art of sunnys friends reacting to the truth its what i came to the sub for 😔
You'd think he found out Sunny killed Mari but it's actually because he found a spider in Sunny's shoulder
Sunny: I sooooooooooooooooooooorry!...
Cop: "Are you pressing charges?". . Sunny: "Hell yeah."
At that point. Sunny wouldn't need a hospital. He'd need a morgue.
2nd times the charm
Sunny still remaining neutral while striking that pose is just what gets me
Nah, she only materialized to accompany Sunny and thus help him during the confession.
I imagine if she tried to make it look like a prank she'd try to pat Sunny on the back only for her fingers to waft through his body.
I just hope that doesn't give the poor Sunny a heart attack XD
Hmmm good point, Sunny may be the type who doesn't get upset with supernatural things (as it seems to be a normal thing in his life).
*Hero throws sunny out of the window*. . Sunny: JUST A PRANK BROOOOOOO-
And that for what?...Mary is not dead, he must be happy about it (only in this case).
Close
Damn Sunny lost his eye for this, true dedication to the bit.
She will explain what really happened, since Sunny still can't speak so she will have to speak for him.
>!Imagining the scenes where Sunny's flesh is ripped apart as he comes to terms with the truth and sees himself fully as a monster, but animated, would be... something!<
Maybe it could work as in Sunny is walking around(in reality it's in his own head) and then seeing the Memories of what truly happened and then slowly putting the Memories together with the Build up(Like the.  Memories being inconsistent in the Order and Sunny having to place them in the right order) and then leading up to the Full Picture of the Truth? . . It will make the Audience go from "What's happening?" To "Wait this is the truth?" And then to "No Way, this is not real."
I imagine that they could integrate some of Sunny's first person POV, like playing off of how he sees the world like an RPG, similarly to the game. At the Aubrey fight, it could be like normal, and then when Sunny stabs her, everything kind of *breaks* and Sunny gets snapped back to reality by Aubrey falling to the ground, slow-mo ish.
Im super late but i decided to look through the top posts and i thought of this.. . . Maybe in Headspace there could be textboxes that show a character speaking, to represent how Sunny views headspace like a video game, and that carries over to the real world until he stabs Aubrey when it all fades away/shatters to pieces.
That actually seems like a cool idea, with the Right director,the Right Animators and with just enough time it could be executed pretty well.
you can do sunny.
Sunny, probably: No.

**Welcome to White Spa- SUNNY WHO THE HECK ARE THOSE TWO AND WHY ARE THEY IN MY ROOM!?**
Imma make a fic about this. . . For some reason sunny is forced to go outside into another country/city with monsters and humans for a few days, he stays at a hotel while his mom deals with some business stuff.. . He gets hungry and decides to go outside to buy something to eat, then he meets berdly by accident, berdly having nothing better to do forces him to hangout with his friends.. . Sunny meets Noelle and other unnamed monsters.. . Berdly learns about sunny not going to school for years and decides bring him there to teach him, "how to be cool at school". . Alphys accepts Sunny as a guest student.. . At some point during class, Sunny decides to go to the bathroom, he then finds Kris and Susie about to enter the mysterious closet.. . Susie being the bully forces sunny to go there first, Sunny enters the room and then Susie and Kris follow him and then the floor falls apart.. . The trio then find themselves in a empty white void with two doors, a white door(headspace) and a gray door(dark world). . Sunny however is no longer there, instead a white and dark version of him is there(OMORI). . Kris then gets confused, this wasnt supposed to happen.. . Susie being confused and angry about whats going on opens the gray door and jumps into the void while trying to find an exit.. . Kris and OMORI jump in as well.. . They find themselves in a barren dark place, Kris  having what appears to be a knight armor and a wooden sword. Kris later encounters OMORI but he didnt change, They later find susie swinging an axe around.. . And so the story begins.. . Also yes im already writting this, dm me for info
I'll watch your career with great interest
Kris also perfectly fits >!Omori/Sunny's!< role too. >!Silent. Protagonist. Sharp stuff. And also can be a maniac at times!<
Aubrey would assault a mcdonalds employee to make sure sunny gets his burger done right
I don’t blame her. That asshole messed up such a simple order for someone so smol that it is punishable by death
Ultimate Girlboss
Suddenly Danganronpa.
You think sunny still orders happy meals?
Obviously he wants them chickie nuggies
why she, isnt sunny male?
Typo that I never caught
thank God, I thought I just mistook omori/sunny's gender this whole time
He orders happy meals just to feel something lmao
“wtf is this shit I didn’t order a depression meal”. . “...oh wait”
everyone does, if you don’t you aren’t real.
don't make me question my existence!
you aren’t real
someone doesn't..?
he's gotta get them nugs somehow
pov : you shouldnt have worked at mcdonalds
Aubrey has always been Sunny's rock (right after Mari). Aubrey would never let Sunny's order be wrong ~~that's why she keeps the bat~~
Art, thank you.
I’m sorry if this is a whoosh moment but I fail to understand...
This tag is art, I scrolled down my reddit, saw it, and decided to thank you for tossing it up. That's pretty much it.
Ah ok
Lol my roommate is Aubrey here and I'm Sunny. She's constantly speaking up for me when I'm just like, "Nooo I'll totally take the wrong order! It's not worth the a n x i e t y..."
Can someone make a comic or a dub of this? I love it lamo
It’s funny because I had another meme but this one blew up so I’m not posting it rn
That’s riGHT
Depression: exists. Smol sunny: im about to end this whole mans career

I'm wondering, since when did this "Excuse me he said no pickles" trend came by?
It’s a trend? I didn’t know that I just thought it was funny
This is definitely canon

I like how it looks like they’re mimicking each other’s expressions
Where are his hands
literalmente eu
i love how the sunflower ship is basically basil being in love with sunny, but sunny either 1. is completely oblivious to basil’s feelings, or 2. doesn’t feel the same way and is being hilariously blunt about it
Or loving him back
Wait isn't that every other Sunny Ship too?
mAILED fISSION 🙂

The requirements to complete the set task have not been met. :c
Mission failed. . we’ll get him next time
Task failed successfully
Saw it on the twitter, shame how much great art isnt properly recognised between both here and there
Between upvotes, awards and comments I think artworks are easily the most recognised posts in this forum(maybe after memes idk). . It’s just that the sheer amount of them(not necessarily a bad thing) drowns out some of the good gems
( I do not allow reposting, if you have seen this comic elsewhere here, it was stolen from me!)
Do you have a twitter so I can share it there?
it's @mieldecolza on twitter!
THANK
Ha. Hilarious.

SUNNY NO PLS
I was like hey! I know you! And I was afraid someone has stolen it ahah. Good to know it's you!
Thank you! It's weird that people recognize me here, I used an old nickname haha
Ahah no I only recognized the comic! Didn't know you were on reddit!
Oh okay, but it's the same for me ahah
Gaysil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG BASIL SO PRECIOUS!!! (And omg Sunny lmao)

Ok but the implications
love him or hate him, he’s spitting facts
He's confused but he got the spirit! 
Troll
Let's just say that Sunny isn't very *bright*.
canon
Both!
I don't understand why people keep complaining when there is no problems to say ''I love you'' to a friend. 🤝
Guys can also say "I love you" without it implying any sexual intent. I understand that you're not referring to this post in particular, but if you're gonna complain about free art and memes, at least do so in the proper thread.
I don't understand why people keep telling other people to not ship when it doesn't affect them at all. You can just not care you know...
THIS IS HILLARIOUS
That’s kinda fruity
sunny is mad cus kel have mad abs, and sunny have the body of a kid that stay indoor for three years
I wonder why Sunny has that body type 🤔
definitely not bc of his hikikkomori lifestyle, that's for sure
I can confirm
out of topic but your pfp gave me serious act 3 ptsd. . watch out where you're going with that thing
in twitter of the artist there is another art of kel pinching sunny belly
[You jest, but the dude who drew the image on the left also drew that]()
Sunny: \*itsy bitsy spider's his fingers\*
Sunny tried to do it again yesterday. When i pushed him away he pulled out a steak knife and started chasing me
Sunny did trash it's not sunny

So like everyone is Sunny except one of them is secretly Omori?
Yes
Sunny goes fücking flying lmao
Nah it has sunnys outfit omori has a tank top and shorts
Sunny during the last battle: hey let's just talk it out. . Omori: what deal you got that can be in exchange of revealing the truth?. . Sunny: how about you can exist in the real life as the cat I have?. . Omori: Deal
I really feel torn right now. Sunny x Aubray or Sunny x Basil? . . Beautiful art.
Sunny has two hands. . . &#x200B;. . Do with that information as you will
BOTH
&#x200B;. . 
Bro is fr 2 years late
true
You got me with the sunny cat
I like the ship between sunny and Aubrie but I kinda feel like the romantic interest is one sided and in Sunny’s dream world he kinda makes it so she does seem to crush on him. I also haven’t finished the game yet. Im on one day left working on getting the “good” ending but after finding out that Sunny killed Mari by accident I got all fucked up and took a break
the cat omor/sunny is the best
I don't know, I have mixed feelings about that.. . Even though I agree that pain is necessary, and negative feelings can come to positive change, even on media, I wonder: what even is the message the game is trying to convey to us?. . Because, the ending is a bit... Weird.. Well, Omori says the things that Sunny tells himself. Although not all of it is necessarily true, it starts very subjective. Until it comes to the very end, where it is the most objective, undeniable painful truth: >!"you loved her, and you killed her."!< All else before this is subjective, but it's still something he believes in and struggles to not believe in; the only support he has is from the memories of what his friends told him.. . But what is the message here? That you should believe your friends and your memories, your positive thinking?. . .... . Well, to be honest, the longer I analyze it, the more it makes sense, actually.. Well, you yourself are the person that chooses to Continue or Not. . And to continue, you need to remember all of the truth, and remember that some things were good, and some were bad. They grew up together and loved each other, genuinely. Although it is hard, you need to carry on with the help of others, and relying only on yourself is not the best thing to do. And this manifests both in Sunny and in Basil to cope with what happen; Sunny distorts things for it to seem like it never happened, and Basil distorts things to make everything look all good. But when the truth seeps in on the back of your brain, only the bad bits of it will be prevalent. This is why you need friends to remember the good bits.. . . ...or something like that.
*The* most important thing you need to take away from the ending is the idea of forgiving yourself and moving on. Everything else is also important, but secondary (and ambiguous). . . Sunny could not face the truth, so he buried it using the dream world and Omori. But it came back to bite him, because of course, repressing that kind of immense pain will only allow it to fester and eventually consume you. You *have* to confront it and deal with the consequences, then allow yourself to heal.. . I say deal with the consequences, because it is 100% a possibility that after Sunny told his friends everything, they could *not* forgive him. I like to believe they did, like we all want to believe that. There is good reason to think that he was, in fact, forgiven by his peers. However, the opposite is also true. What if the gang can't move on from Sunny's transgression? Omori could be absolutely right about Sunny's friends leaving him. Or *maybe*, Sunny's positive outlook is closer to reality. No one can say for sure, but Sunny needs to be able to forgive himself *regardless* of what his friends' reactions will be. And the first step towards healing is actually facing reality and letting the truth come out. Cause if he doesn't, well, you know what happens. . . Don't forget, Sunny leaves town, too. He has a second chance at making new friends even if Kel, Aubrey and Hero don't forgive him. But if he hasn't forgiven *himself*, then he will never be able to connect to people again and will forever be stuck in his dream world. Or he'll fuckin' yeet himself off a building lol
Very very very good analysis! Thank you so much for this. I agree with you 100%.
This could also be Sunny to Omori.
S.A.N.S:. Sunny After Not Surviving
>!Plot twist: Sans is trying to free Sunny from Omori's grasp!<
Yes except put the whole plot of Omori in after the crash and the friends are asking each other this about Sunny’s Christmas present
who needs Sunny when you’ve got her?
I always need Sunny.
speaking like a true femboy. . jk. . but ya know
Yeah, instead of Aubrey learning that Sunny is Brittish, she backs off before anything can happen because she notices Sunny has a knoife
Good thing Sunny isn't All American^TM. That would open up a whole new ending.
DOOMori
Rip and tear starts playing in the background
Now I’m just reminded of Moria’s Trauma from Resident Evil Revelations 2. . >!Moira’s police dad leaves the weapon cabinet not locked properly and Moira decides to play with his revolver with her younger sister nearby!< , literally less then a year after her dad sells out his coworkers to save his kids
Wait I mean sunny

sunny deez nuts


Ahem...
What sunny would you like
*sunny plays final duet
Nope. Some people just didn’t have sunny attack and kept going
Oh 
"These bandages aren't helping my blunt force trauma, SUNNY, but thanks for your consideration!". . ""
Sunny: Damn, this isn't funny.
I find funny how Sunny unlike Omori is a support character more than a DPS character
I got the impression that Aubrey is into Sunny but not the other way around, it seemed like there was more reason to believe Sunny is into Basil imo
Spoiler warning but >!in one of the memories in memory lane, going to view Basil’s picture upon interacting with him prompts him to ask if Sunny has a crush on Aubrey and Sunny’s ears turn red.!<
Sunny’s getting all the.. gender neutral maidens
Under his circumstances I can see why he did that, he lied for Sunny’s sake, though it was his fault, lost almost everything, and he is losing his grandmother, he gets bullied by Aubrey’s gang for something he didn’t do, reuniting with sunny only to find out he is moving away, of course he would go mad, and he would commit suicide if you didn’t help him, honestly I think basil is forgiveable, even if it’s hard
I know this is super old but like, two of those things Sunny also did, he also lied to everyone about what happened and he also hung Mari. Why do people hold those actions more against Basil than Sunny?
But sunny also hung mari and lied to everyone, and almost killing sunny was because basil was about to kill himself
i can't blame anyone for hating him. if someone is a weirdo creeper asshole IRL, you don't GET to hear their tragic backstory.. . and even if you DID, would it change that they did a weirdo asshole thing?. . i sympathize with basil's clear signs of trauma and clear fucked up mentality before he even did The Thing, but it's up to everyone's interpretation of "how fucked up is Too Fucked Up to justify". . . some people dislike sunny because of the same reason. sunny has "it was an accident" as an excuse, but we need to always remember. 1) it's omori's/sunny's perspective, he may skew the perception of himself unintentionally. 2) the End Result being worse than the Intended Outcome of Conscious Action doesn't resolve him of blame. he's a child, but he still Did The Action, if that makes sense.. . sorry abt Vagueness, i'm trying to not have to spoiler chunks while being Spoiler Free.
. >!Ok to preface I appreciate the fact that you don’t want to argue because I don’t either, I just want to have a discussion about him not everything has to be an argument. I wanted to say that I feel like a lot of people see the argument of him being in complete shock and not thinking rationally and do consider it but take it at face value or dismiss it to some degree. I’m not a psychologist and even I think that an entire suicide plan is still pretty weird as an impulse but I feel like it’s often underestimated how badly shock can affect you if you’ve never been in a situation like that. I won’t go into too much detail for personal reasons but I experienced a somewhat traumatic situation like that a few years ago and I feel like the shock I experienced there helped me understand him more, it’s not just that you’re shocked honestly it’s like your brain just completely blanks out and completely ignores the reality in front of you. It was mentioned in the game how even to this day he still didn’t believe Sunny was the one who killed Mari, when he came up with the fake suicide plan based off what I said earlier I don’t think he could mentally comprehend the magnitude of what he was doing beyond just protecting Sunny, of course we know how fucked up it was from a completely outside perspective but in that moment I’d say his impulse was more protect Sunny than hang Mari, with the state of shock he was in causing him to be unaware of his actual actions. Obviously I don’t think he’s innocent either it kind of bothers me when people make him out to be a cute flower boy who never did anything wrong, I see him more as an extremely mentally unstable teenager who was severely traumatised by his actions in a moment of shock. I still completely understand and respect your opinion because I felt like that for a while too, unless you try to dig really deep it really just seems that way. I wonder if there is a psychologist that’s actually analysed this game though it’d be pretty interesting (and sorry for the essay lol it wasn’t intentional)!<
You can find at least one "psychologist plays Omori" playthroughs on YouTube. It's interesting to get their take on it.
I’ll have a look thank you!
Thanks for the EXTREMELY long paragraph, I made my interpretation of Basil in the comments.. . He's practically the most faulted both rightfully and wrongfully. He's a tragic character who saw something... in the wrong time. He's someone to depend to understand the faults of each character and their motives, he gives the compassion differently to Sunny than everyone else, he's not just "yeah he did bad" he is subject to the whole game starting.. . What I love is >!HEADSPACE Basil got the photo because I believe somewhere in Sunny's mind through remembering Mari, SOMETHING arrived to set their entire journey up, or at least my thoughts on it  !<he's done bad things but that doesn't mean he's bad, all characters go through pain and Sunny imo is the worst of them all since he's the reason it started.. . He lost his >!family, friends, Sunny who moved away!<, etc. Maybe he deserves some forgiveness in the end
Most people who hate don't feel this way about him because he is "annoying", but because they find his actions throughout the game as despicable and think of him as a psycho.. . >!The fact his first thought after witnessing his best friend killing his sister is to fake her suicide speaks volumes how mentally ill of a child he is to come up with this shit. The amount effort he was willing to put into doing something as horrible as desecrating the body of his supposed friend as well having enough conscious to put up a plan like this is definitely not something normal or good person would do.!<. . >!Besides his actions doubled the suffering of his friends especially Sunny's whose main fear and source of self hatred was created because Basil staged suicide with him. The worst part is that unlike Sunny he didn't isolate himself completely from outside world and actually had some insight to what Aubrey, Kel and Hero were going through and yet he chose to leave them suffering partly because of his actions for sake of his obsession with Sunny. The game is very consistent in showing how little they mean to him compared to Sunny.!<. . >!You could say that Sunny is just as bad as him for going through his plan and ignoring his friends for his own benefit however there are two important differences between him and Basil.!<. . >!First one is that we actually experience how much Sunny suffers throughout the game and how guilty he feels about what happened to Mari which makes it easier to emphasize with main character. Basil suffers ofcourse too from his actions however most of the pain seems to be only derived from Sunny abandoning him instead of anything else.!<. . >!Second one is that Sunny in the end finds a courage to go out of his house, save his friends and tell them truth about Mari because they deserve it showing us how much he cares about them to be willing to lose them forever just do what's right.!<. . >!Unlike Sunny Basil seems to have little if any redeemable qualities at all to overshadow the sins he committed. No matter how relatable is situation may be it doesn't change what horrible things he has done.!<. . I myself don't hate him, but morally he is by far most ambiguous character in the game and I am tired when some people depict him as some kind of soft boy angel. He is someone way different and complex than this bullshit.
The descriptions are from Sunny's POV, we don't know if Basil was feeling the same way, especially since he staged the whole thing. He did probably start feeling the guilt after the group was fractured and more importantly after Sunny "left him" but we don't know if those are the only reasons he regretted doing what he did.
So was Sunny, but he didn't think of anything like THAT.
Because people panic differently.
I remember hearing somewhere that in Asian communities, having a family member commit suicide is like a really dishonourable thing to the family name. Under the assumption that sunnys family are Asian American, then they may not have opened a police investigation into what happened. Not trying to like enforce stereotypes or whatever, just thought that it may help cover up that plot hole (if what I heard is true and isn’t bs)
Differance between sunny and basil are how they end the game sunny overcome his something and came back to reality but basils last action is stabbing sunny . . But also both aubrey and sunny didnt intent for what happend but basil always had a say in it. . Am i saying he is a criminal ? No. İ am saying İts so much harder to forgive him
It's what I said up there, I left the game with confliting thoughts. His actions were shit, but it was definitly panic.
Well technically it’s his fault.. But really it was a heated argument like any other family has sometimes, he just happened to panic and pushed her at the wrong time and in the wrong place.. Personally it just feels wrong to blame a kid, especially Sunny.. . Agreed.
Well like the problem is that heated family argument context is not something devoid of intent, anyone who has had a sibling has been there, if you push or strike a sibling you never mean whatever the consequence is, but you definitely want something to happen to them, deep down you truly want them to hurt in that moment. It’s certainly wrong place and wrong time, it’s quite possibly the worst case scenario that could ever happen. But Sunny can’t say he didn’t mean it, and as such, he has a very personal responsibility for it.
Wellll yes he meant to push her.. not to kill her.
No sibling even wishes to kill another. By pushing with intent to harm, losing himself in his anger, he invited the possibility into existence irresponsibly. The simple fact that he knows that there was an intent deep down is the real problem, because he can’t just say “it was some dumb accident”. He’s a murderer.
[I agree with most of that except the last part]. Jesus dude he’s a kid- He couldn’t have thought of all of the consequences in those few seconds.
I actually went into the game knowing the big twist at the end, but even then I still really cared about him- followed Stranger at ever opportunity, never hesitated on the various >!"Do you want to save Basil"!< prompts, felt genuinely horrible about all of his >!black space scenes, knocked on his door like 10 times on the final night.!<. . Big spoilers ahead. . >!I think what people don't understand is that kids at the age he and Sunny were during Mari's fall can't fully understand the consequences of something as huge as accidentally killing a person, and end up making worse decisions because the simple idea of being implicated in that is enough to make them want to completely avoid it, not to mention the potential that it could lead to losing friends, which, as anyone will tell you, is often a child's worst fear. I feel there's also an element of his image of Sunny there, I got the impression that he put him up on a super high pedestal and couldn't cope with that image being tarnished by Sunny's outburst, so came up with a lie he could tell himself to keep seeing his very best friend as perfect.!<. . . I've more to say on this but I think I've gone on long enough for now, I mean, this is a meme ffs. . Edit: Had to repost comment because I didn't properly spoiler tag
All his actions were done with intent but also he tried to kill sunny at the end of the game,sunny litarally jumped to save his life twice on contrast (the lake and the last day)
so he controlled Sunny into hanging her so no one blames them
So no one blames *Sunny.* Basil was just trying to help, as he himself would gladly take the blame, like how he did for blacking out the photos of Mari when that was actually Sunny's doing.
AND CREATING SOMETHING AND HIDING THE TRUTH IS TRYING TO HELP?
Yes. Emphasis on *trying,* but still. As misguided and ultimately disastrous as Basil's actions may have been, they were still taken selflessly, with Sunny's best interests in mind.
ok, the next time a friend needs help, im hanging their sister
Well to start yes it was his idea to hang her but also he lied to everyone for four years then he tries to kill sunny "stop struggling,sunny" and then contrast to sunny never reedems himself his litarally Last action is attemted murder on sunny
I don’t know. I don’t think he’s a bad person I mean wasn’t he literally 12 YEARS OLD? I feel like his way of coping and handling it was just W A Y worse than Sunny. I may be just giving him too much credit and leeway but idk
The big problem is he tried to kill sunny when he was 16
Sunny scribbled the photos
>!You don’t think properly when you were 12, and he wanted to protect sunny, and in the end he lost everything, he only has his helper left to comfort him and he might lose his grandma too!<
i believe sunny doesnt know anything about cooking, but knows very well how to make a frozen steak perfectly
so perfect it makes you vomit <3
It’s just part of the recipe
The Nausea brings out the flavor
Step 1: get steak. Step 2: put in freezer
step 3: microwave steak. . step 4: salmonella
step 5: “hoLY SHIT I’M BLASTING OUT OF BOTH ENDS”
step 6: MY HEART'S A SEIZING
Step 7: “MY LUNGS A WHEEZIN”
Step 8: THE FUCKING WALLS ARE MELTING
Step 9: “I CAN HEAR SATAN’S VOICE! HE’S TELLING ME TO- *INVEST IN APPLE?* **WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???** ***WHY DOES HE WANT ME TO BUY APPLES???????***”
I miss him :(
WHY DID SAM O NELLA LEAVE
i would WATCH THAT. . like sunny watched the pot
good job sunny
Sunny watching his mental health crumble
Yeah this captures Sunny’s personality perfectly
Now sunny has to spend hours cleaning that stove.
Yo Snuflin I've seen your name and comics on a youtube vid once. One where Sunny just does this with his hand ✌ and he just disappears sorry ahem other then that this comic is funny and cute.
thank you. It doesn’t bother me much as long as they link back to my Reddit/Tumblr, but I’m probably going to start adding my username.
Ah alrighty and hope your having a good day . Your name reminds me of someone in Moomin Valley name Snufkin
:D that’s where I got my name from!
Woah very poggers didn't think I'd find the origin of a name
sunny no. . don't overflow the cum pot
now we need an sunny background ;>
One of two options: they became friends again or Sunny was left without a girlfriend.
>!why does sunny have no eye then?!<
>!omocat just messing with her fans a little bit, the original image we could only really see aubrey basil sunny with a bit of kel. so everyone thought it was a "after the game" scenario!<
Nah it’s just because Sunny watched too many Ling Ling 40 hours / 2setviolin
true. only aspect of the game that isnt very great. omocat portrays sunny as this "cute depressed anime boy" but really he'd look fucking AWFUL after staying indoors for 4 years and not eating properly.
Anorexia ridden rat man
He already is kinda skinny, however realistically he should look like just skin and bones
Isn't the only frame of reference the days where his mother isn't home and there's just The Steak™️? Because it *isn't* skin and bones, it's possible he ate somewhat properly during the four year time period.
Idk anything about lore but I assume their mom was there to feed them before the move.
I GO UP AT NIGHT. . AND EAT YOUR ***CHEEEEEEEEEEESE***. . #AAA
I now headcanon Sunny as a 3am shredded cheese gremlin.. . Thanks.
Me too
NOT MY CHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESE!!!!!!! . . #NOOOOOOOO
GET THE FUCKING RAT DISTINGUISHER (rat distinguisher: "yeah that's definitely a rat")
Cheesa?. . 
Now that you say it...i wish this picture was actually how Sunny looked to show how bad it was for him physically even if the mum actually took care of him somewhat. We all know mentally but his physical health is important too. ~~although my guy can literally heal himself trying to stay calm so uh~~
He takes care of his hygiene though like his mom tells him to.. . I think seeing this in the mirror though, on the first night, would really hit the player in the gut. So this is less of a mistake and more of a missed opportunity.
i guess but i doubt he puts makeup on, and we don't see him fix his hair after he wakes up. Not to mention brushing his teeth is optional and he only bathes in the hikikomori route
Maybe it revolves around pure speculation but if we assume that Sunny's mom left a note about brushing teeth, and Sunny bathes himself in the hikikomori route, its safe to assume he has always done those.
Well, just ’cause you’re mentally ill doesn’t always mean you don’t take care of yourself physically. For some people, taking some care of your appearance can be a way to cope or to keep at least some kind of routine. It’s true that Sunny seems to have trouble eating properly and possibly remembering to brush his teeth, but in hikikomori we also see him taking a bath, so it’s hard to be quite sure how much he does take care of himself or not.
He would still probably look like a twig and have messy hair..  Showering can only help so much
He does look like a twig, and he might’ve just kept taking care of his hair. Having messy hair is kind of uncomfortable and his mom probably made sure he did the minimum of taking care of himself anyway
Yeah, the notes around the house seem to imply she's aware of his situation enough not to push him, and so he maintains a basic hygiene routine but not much else. Sunny was hardly unaware of things in the real world even of his grasp on reality was shaky, so I imagine he took enough care of himself to keep his mom from freaking out too badly, especially because doing so would make it easier for him to then continue isolating himself and thus dreaming.
can confirm.
The taking a bath scene is however also the one that makes him lose his fear of drowning. Which might imply that he hadn't done it for a while. Yes I'm late to reply to this.
Maybe it’s just how Sunny sees himself since he is kinda disconnected from reality.
that could be true i suppose, though we do see him in the 3rd person outside of mirrors very occasionally like when they hug at the lake, or the good ending
I found that a little jarring on my first playthrough. There's a shut-in at one of the Faraway houses and I wondered why Sunny wasn't as bad when they both lead the same lifstyle.
Because sunny's mom knows he cant take care of himself well. She likely makes sure he eats at least every night, showers and brushes teeth. I've had short hair before and I barely even needed a comb. It wouldnt be hard to keep up an appearance. The only unrealistic thing is him >!diving and saving basil but my headcanon is mari ACTUALLY saved him just like she appeared so many other times.!< The guy in grandma's house is obviously well fed and at the very least has his siblings. Hes a shut in but hes the video game shut (who barely leaves his room) when sunny is the sleep all day shut in who barely leaves his house instead of just his room.
>!Pretty sure thats what happened... Thats why Kel didn't say Sunny did it, but said he was brave, Because Hero saved them both as Sunny was struggling. I tend to think canonically Sunny would have paused to silently freak out for like, 3 seconds but when he realises that its actually a danger and Kels relying on him he jumps in instead of an instant decision!<
It would be cool if you see the groomed version of sunny when looking in the mirror but in the last day, we see this version, showing that in reality he doesn’t eat well, exercise, and isn’t groomed.
Yeah, now that's a great idea. ONE DAY LEFT on the SUNNY ROUTE would be the perfect place to have this version, as someone else suggested that the reason SUNNY looks so neat could be because of his hallucinations, and I reckon as SUNNY gets closer to THE TRUTH, he also realises he's in such a sorry state from not looking after himself.
Actually that would've been awesome to wake up on the first day looking like utter shit and then over the next 3 days with showering and going to barber, etc. due to going outside with Kel we can look like the neat/cute sunny we saw on day one. That would've been another nice sidestory of progression that would've added to the immersion of how Sunny is trying to move on and live in reality
i love this idea honestly
Yep, Sunny is portrayed kinda unrealistic. Also that part where Basil is having a panic attack in the bathroom he asks him "Why do you look so scared, Sunny?" The mf'er looks himself in the mirror and he's perfectly fine.
Maybe Basil, being such a close friend to Sunny, can read his inner emotions.
That's making me think... a lot of the game depends on Sunny's mental state affecting his perceptions. Something is probably the most obvious example. In my experience someone like Sunny would want to be convinced that they're totally fine. Realistically he probably would have eye bags or look somewhat differently from his appearance four years ago, but he can't see himself any differently.
Yeah I think about this sometimes like this guy literally sat inside for 4 whole years and looks better than me (ik there isn’t as much detail to their faces but still)
too much sleeping can make you equally as tired though. i sleep too much and have eyebags. although eyebags aren't only caused by tiredness
Is it confrmed that he never ate properly
not exactly confirmed but, >!Kels mother takes note of Sunny’s more.. slim physique. Also, on one day left in the sunny route, if you go to the park and sit on the swings with Aubrey, she also tells him he looks slimmer I believe!<
It is confirmed, she says he looks pale and that he looks like he doesnt eat enough. He probably only eats dinner when his mom forces him to.
Cool I just said that because my memory of that dialogue was a bit hazy
Yea I just replayed it so its vivid in my mind.
Director's cut sunny
Maybe its only how hes perseving himself, like hiw he blocked the mental image of the closet, maybe hes pretending he's fine too?
I would agree with this but >!we see at the end of the good ending that he looks the same in person, since this is in the third person and not in a mirror.!< Though i suppose this could still be that so you may be right.
>!He's also in a hospital, they probably took care of him and that's why he looks neater!<
exactly and that's coming from a person who doesn't go outside that much
To be fair his Mom was there for most of those 4 years . . It's only in the last 3 days that she's out of town
\>Looks like shit. . \>Stabs best friends. . \>Reveals the truth. . \>Leaves. . Sigma Octadecanonuinfinitillionaire Grindset
Sunny is simply built different
His mother likely groomed his hair personally; although maybe it would've been nice to see him looking a bit rough on the second or third day.. . Maybe Sunny has a few cleanly habits that he keeps up with that are largely deceptive of his overall health and it just isn't clearly shown; still bathing and doing his own hair. We do know he doesn't eat well, as he's remarked as thin. But thin for a teenage boy and thin as in dying are different too, it's possible Sunny fits a few metrics for doing okayish, which puts his mother's guard down somewhat (still too much, but you know).. . "Yeah he looks thin and he never gets out, but he's still kind, studious (some evidence in dreams of that), cleans himself or cleans when I ask him to, and seems to say he's fine when I ask (as unwell teens also tend to, but again yeah).". . I think if anything, the picture resembles a good mental state of Sunny that is disguised by himself in the literal sense.
I thought he straight up dropped out of school or something
Although I highly doubt that his mother had the time to homeschool him because you can obviously tell she’s very busy basing it off the events of the game alone. But it’s also a possibility that Sunny could’ve been teaching himself off of a program on his computer. He does have one after all.
It's clear sunny isn't stupid. Theres been some kind of education going.
Isn't French a topic when the student reaches 6th,7th grade?. . For all i am aware of, Sunny Hikikomori'd himself near the age of 12, which isn't really the age they are taught French, for all i know.
Ik im late but where I live in the usa French isn’t taught until 9th grade in my school
I'm not a native speaker and i wasn't aware that the word grooming had a second meaning. Was very confused at first. Lmao

it should honestly be the other way around . . just modern social media has skewed the word the other way. . I didn't even know the bad definition for grooming until like 4 years ago
Exactly
honestly me too lmao
How could it be confusing in that way for you? They were using the word's literal definition ^(@).@  . I mean, if there's one definition you'd learn from a secondhand source like a language course or a reference book or just written-word osmosis, wouldn't it be the literal one? :\\
Sunny open the door...I'll brush your hair and help you get fixed up...
(opens the door). . Actually this would be good. . After all ı'll go out doon
nah, get sent to >!blackspace!<
If only Sunny had full mastery over his Hamon.  The game could have turned out very differently.
Sunny's been to the Demon Slayer school of breathing-solves-all-bodily-harm.
LMAO STOP

Too relatable

I really like this depiction of Sunny, it works well with the pacing. Looking in the mirror at night to reveal a miserable, unkempt form of Omori really makes the player put on the brakes, going from the joys of Headspace, to Basil disappearing, to Omori stabbing himself, to seeing this in the mirror. All within the span of 10 minutes.. . The first day IRL is supposed to hit you hard with reality, and this would make for a great introduction.
True on that.. . Not to forget that it would fit with the situation generally.
omg he looks just like me fr
The [Person]() who made this edit!
*"It's been 84 years."* - Sunny seeing the sun again.
It's been 17 days
Perfect pic, you gain a save
Yeah definitely. I was thinking about that recently as I was drawing him, mans definitely wouldn't have looked so squeaky clean while being heavily depressed and dissociated, while being a hikikomori for 4 years. When I draw him pre ending etc, he looks somewhat like on this img
Yep, he's beginning to look like he goes on 4chan alright . . . As it should be
I think it would've been cool if this was Sunny's look when you start the game. And if you go through the Sunny route he would progressively look better until in the Last day he looks like in the normal portrait. However if you choose the Omori route he wouldn't change at all or would start getting worse.
Imagining Kel greeting him for the first time in four years with "Damn Sunny, you look like shit, lets go to Hobbeez"
: I've forgotten what real food other than microwaved steak tastes like... WAIT WHO SAID THAT?  . . . : You said that, Sunny...  . . . : Oh... I forgot what my voice sounded like...
I mentally headcannon sunny does a bare minimum taking care of himself to more or less keep mom from worrying. That’s how I kinda operated even at my worst moments.

Because he is the cameraman, of course/s. . (JUST BEING SARCASTIC).
now i'm just imagining someone like "DO YOU HAVE THE SOURCE TO CLAIM HE'S THE CAMERAMAN !!!??!?!?!"
Well, anyone who watches movies should have the answer:. "The Cameraman always survives" ( and Sunny too apparently),... well, until you enter the Backrooms.
tbh i like this design way better than sunny’s og design, and I already like sunny’s design.
All jokes aside. I did know people who were not going outside for years. One of those people, the girl, also suffered from anorexia. There was quite a difference between how those people handled themselves, despite not leaving the house. In the case of the girl, she was very uptight in regards to keeping her house organized. While she was skinny she definitely wasn’t “a ratwomen”. I am aware that some people reached level where they are severely malnourished and this hampers how they body functions. But just because it doesn’t look like it or person maintains certain level of control, it doesn’t mean they don’t suffer from the issue. . . In the case of the guy, he had trouble doing anything, including keeping contact with people for extended periods of time. . . I don’t want to go to deeply in their personal issues.  But I feel like I have to say this. People experience different  kinds of issues and this will cause them to have their ups and downs. Often without telling people what is happening and try to hide the fact that those periods did happened to them. . . So the bottom line is, don’t help spread stigmatization. On purpose or unknowingly. And don’t say “o yeah, that’s definitely how it should be in real life, that’s so unrealistic” while the reality tends to be more complicated. I understand that it sounds logical and as something that “easily should be” but then, when that’s not the case, it helps spread confusion.
This pic goes hard.
I used to look just like that in 9th grade
i like to think he kept up his appearance either because it’s habitual, it’s the same clothes he wore *that day,* or he’s doing it in memoriam of *them*
I feel like the ONLY thing Sunny did self care wise was stay ready for the recital, hence the neat, clean clothes and perfect hair, even though he knew Mari was gone
One more thing, facial hair.. . Though I believe what little grip on reality Sunny has may be credit to his hygiene routine being seemingly good (at least, he looks tidy). . . Having spoken to 3 therapists in my time they all think a solid routine boosts mental health. . . Or his mummy does it for him. But I'd say he'd end up looking a mess after the several days the game takes place in - with no parents to help.. . Or of course the most likely case - omocat just didn't think about this.
hair goes hard tbh
Man looks like Doug Rattman from Portal 2
"A truth so strange it can only be lied into existence.". . "And our minds *can* lie, never doubt it..."
Wow this matches the in game artstyle perfectly
OMG STOP THATS MY FACE DONT LEAK KY FACE ILL RPEORT U 
i think that's probably because it's from sunny's point of view and he thinks everything is fine until his escapism starts to break . because >!when you look in the mirror during the hiki route you see omori and not sunny!< he might not even fully process that it's been 4 entire years since what happened to mari until other people say it
He probably kept himself in shape during those times. He homeschooled himself, kept himself clean... No wonder he looked completely fine.
He just like me fr
yeah thats one of the only things thats kinda bugged me about omori, even though its not really that big of a deal its still completely inaccurate
he literally just looks like me, which makes me realize I should take better care of my looks
His hair would probably longer
I mean maybe he still brushed his hair etc. Trauma/depression/ptsd/whatever he’s going through ≠ not doing anything at all.
Yeah I agreed, how did Sunny stayed this clean after 4 years ?. . ...
Possibly long hair
ohhohoho man this is so accurate and a bit more realistic
Awesome artwork! Yeah, Sunny definitely would've looked like garbage after those four years.
Me waking up every morning:
Mood
looks exactly like me except the hair color
Wow, now Sunny and I are even more alike 0.o (Except I'm not that skinny and not malnourished)
This looks like me if I didn’t work out
Really well made!. . I just wanted to point out that Sunny probably would not look tired because he sleeps A LOT. Like, he goes to bed before the sun sets snd wakes up at sunrise.
Nahh he wouldn't even have bothered to put on proper clothes, probably.
I dont get how, if he spends so much time in headspace, sleeping, why the fuck doesnt he change out of the collared shirt, literally just get some pyjamas
FR. This started bothering me more than anything after my sister pointed it out to me: why the hell does Sunny sleep in his day clothes?? Surely he has pyjamas or like, and undershirt to sleep in right??
You literally made him look better
he looks like me during the school year
You are depressing
Kinda reminds me of L from death note.
Thats how i look everyday... :(
wtf he's hot now
Did you give him a 5 o'clock shadow? 
When dat something brew hits
Can someone make a mod so that this is what appears in the mirror from after cleaning the floor to after taking a bath (hikikomori)? Pwetty pweawse? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
thanks for reminding me why i kin him
*how I look now.
God I wish I could draw/edit like this, maybe one day
I can’t imagine him being too dirty. I mean showers are a great place to cry out your sorrows.
Didn't expect to be called out like this
needs more hair
4 year's no therapy
He's still Snuuy to me, and I love him regardless of whether or not he took a shower in the last 4 years.. . Kel probably does too, he hasn't showered in a few days either
reminds me of me
His hair didn't grow btw, it feels like they got into stasis for 4 years
And looking like that, it seems a bit funny to me that he can do the Universally Loved achievement
i wish they actually made him look like that in the game. its the realism and subtle touches that matter a ton
League of legends player
This is so true, and very well done!
I look worse than Sunny whenever I just get out of bed, let alone shut myself in for 4 years. Immersion ruined
Can confirm. Been insulated in my house for years and barely go out - (school), and I do not look nice eathier. Due to being female, It's more prone on me. I can provide images but I look too shit on them to be confident to post.
yeah, and let's not forget that he's still a kid who's living with his mom. his mom probably takes care of him, even if it's not much
\+ hair style. . \-health
guys can we please not forget the fact that he still lives with his mom. we don't see her since she apparently is busy setting things up for their new place, but I'm pretty sure she didn't leave Sunny to fend for himself, considering all voicemails and the sticky notes in the bathroom and Sunny's room
Plot twist: Sunny is so delusional that he hallucinated himself as someone clean and tidy, when in reality he looks like shit
Why he needs eyebags if he sleeps all the time??
You can get eyebags from oversleeping due to accumulated fluids under the eyes.
He looks like he hasn't slept in those four years. He sleeps a LOT, so those eyebags wouldn't be there.
you can get eyebags from too much sleep
I’m just confused as to why he has literally no body hair, bro’s superpower is always having pristine skin
I think hed be a lot more pale
He looks pretty pale already..
Yea but four years without going outside, only having sun from windows. I'd think he'd be a lot more pale
tbh, if there were scars i think this would be perfect, as during the times sunny was awake, he probably would commit self harm, but idk
I imagine that when sunny sees himself in the mirror, he’s hallucinating himself from 4 years ago on the night of the recital (which is why he seems to be dressed up every day for nothing). He just happens to look really similar to how he did when he shut himself in because he hasn’t grown at all due to malnutrition
i think sunny just sees himself how he did before the tragedy, being why he still looks relatively well-kept, due to him detaching from reailty
Wanna brush his hair and make him look like  this
i want to hug him and tell everythings gonna be ok
wow he looks like me now
True. .   . this is actually what I made my OC to look like, roughly
Actually pretty realistic
Hes not fat here
oh this is a phenomenal redraw.. . and I can confirm, this is in fact what I look like.
I feel like he would have grown a tiny beard
can i use this as a pfp on discord
Sunny is me fr
THE SAME
True.
Okay... But why is he still kinda slaying 💅. (This is a joke if you look like this please get help)
this is accurate as someone who 1. doesn't go outside a lot and 2. didn't go outside for the many years of covid you get very messy with terrible eye bags and become very very pale
Hikokomori route shows that Sunny showers and changes clothes so no, he wouldn't have looked like that.
Omg he's literally me fr fr
plus his stomach would be skinny and thin because he is, well malnourished
I reopen Reddit and see this first. I post comment, I leave upvote and close Reddit for the day.
Damn same
I was only away for half a day, but my point still stands.
Literally the same thing for me
yup. sams
That's where the plushies went! To the one person Sunny cult!
It's illegal to have that many Sunny plushies sir
One person?
To hug him right…? *to hug him… right…?*
Okay, Sunny's my favorite so yes. Basil, *I'd like to know your location.*
healthy relationships 👍
I need SUNNY BEAN PLUSH
Sunny bean plush is my new best friend.
Simp
just realized how ironic that was based on my username-
When you're making caption memes, please credit the original artist.. . 
They explicitly mention asking for permission before using their art too...
Yeah, I got the image from the Discord server, couldn't find the original artist, but thanks
POV: You are Polly
Oh god
Is that Sunny's shadow in the doorway?
Sunny wants hugs too
Snuuy puulshy supremacy
omori au where basil takes care of sunny plushies instead of plants
This is cannon now
*what the fuck*
That's some pretty good art
:flushed:
There was always something weird about sunny's face but I could never put my finger on it until now.. . FUMO
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh…
Well we all are gonna raid him then hug them ok
I want his room, how much money for it?
Considering the good quality Omori and Sunny plushies are not for sale, if you make the Sunny plushies yourself then the total price would be of the room itself and the raw materials for plushies, though I'm clueless on the exact price.
*razormind intensifies*
Marketable
Nice
artist please
. . Here, the original post
thank you
exuse me i would like to ask why does he have so many sunny things?
'Cause the artist decided to draw him that way, he actually doesn't have any of that, maybe just the photos and not that many of them, nor are they all exclusively of Sunny
He has the OMORI plushies, get him.
I gently open the door. . wrong reference right game
This feels inappropriate
Why ?
Breaking and entering is illegal
Lmao
YEEES NEED ME A SUNNY PLUSHY
Well I mean, it is in Sunny's head and he probably has no idea how to cook real dishes.
Sunny's would be microwaved steak
Cat Girlfriend and then gift her to Sunny
That eye on Sunny's pocket is such a nice touch
Yeah I thought it would be nice because if he closes his jacket, the eye is on his heart
attention to detail. love it
omg why did this make me sad again </33 That’s so perfecttt
can tottaly relate!
Sunny’s lookin’ fresh. . Brilliant art.
Thank you !!  Glad you like =D
They drip
Hey!! Thank youuuuu. Yeah I'm open for commissions =D
You can send on @sunsetfoam =D

You still do commissions? How much do you charge?
Hey ! I don't have much slots open at the moment but here's all you need to know :D . . It'll soon be open again . .

Looks great
Dude, that's crazy good!!!
Yo this is really nice, I’m saving this so I can look at it later one day xD how did u draw the clothing folds I mess up on that like 2/3 of the time ;-;
Clothes folds are really hard. . I don't really know how to explain how to draw them but I used to copy a lot from photos and observation drawing :) there are also some tutos
Nice, they almost look like normal teenagers
Sunny and Basil if they were born in 2004
This looks genuinely incredible holy crap. . The eye on Sunny's pocket is a great touch too
This is so beautiful! ♥️ Congrats!!
Thank you !! =D
They’re so cute I love this
I need clothes like that!
They're soo cute omg
I LOVE THIS
I see that
The images with the sunset and the pine tree inevitably draw me in.
i like how sunny has a SOMETHING hoodie.
Omfg so cute I love this. . Well done
Something jacket 😳
Cool
what the hell this is so cool!. . im coming back with my free award lol
Awwww, look at these two! And this art, damn; you draw them so well, op!! I love their outfits. |3
ZAMN😳🍊🍊GOOD ART 😔😔😔😳
and he never wore that jacket again after realizing it was something in disguise
Holy crap! This is so good!
mans got the sans drip
Oh my god! This is adorable
*pulls out a mug*. . . . This is a mugging!. . . Put your art style in the bag! (I wanna draw like this U~U)
Something Jacket
Amazing!
They got the drip.
au where the gang becomes bikers
really need to draw that
alr time to copy sunny's drip
this may be if omori took place in this year
They have drip (expanded)
Now put Sunny in there and make everyone else sleep
Sunny speed up the car
 now that i have seen post I can just imagine sunny saying “get in loser we’re going to brazil” and I am haunted by that sentence…
Why did Sunny wanted to go to Brazil anyway?
Sunny isn’t actually going to Brazil, he just wants the Piston Cup.
Imagine he just randomly speeds up and jumps off a cliff
Meanwhile omori and sunny: *having a legendary battle while dark souls boss battle theme is playing*
*VORDT THEME STARTS*
**Please no.**  .  I'm sorry but as a dark souls Fan the Vordt Theme is SO overused.  .  I get that it's Intense at the second phase but still. Why cant we have the [Soul of cinder]() theme or [Slave Knight Gael]() theme Or hell.. Anything else   . anything asides from [THIS]() (Bass boost warning.)
Yeah i agree, was just for the meme, id prefer (spoilers for ds3) >!soul of cinder!< In that fight, would fit a little better
cope
How about the Pure Vessel theme. . (Btw I've been considering playing dark souls after playing Hollow Knight, which game should I play first, and does it have scary/disturbing things that are worse than omori?)
Hollow knight have a pretty sad lore and idk about dark souls
hollow knight has a lot of abyss baby murder, not disturbing or graphic tho, just kinda oh mah gah moments. And that's coming from someone who doesn't have the balls to even play OMORI, just watch it and suck up the lore like the goblin i am.

goddamn anime dragon ball s jojo fight goin on. . and nobody cares
Sunny to Aubrey: “Uh…I was 12 when I made them, you can’t blame me for any strange or inaccurate things about them! Heheh…”
Aubrey: “The Kel you dreamed up is the EXACT SAME as the real one, though!”. . Sunny: “Uh... erm... well...”. . Omori: ***watching the argument while drinking black coffee***
Sunny: well…what about Omori? He’s the me of this world, and we don’t act like each other at all! Also Kel is more simple to get down, I mean he hasn’t changed in the last four years. And don’t forget how different emotions work in the dream world, a single dandelion is all it takes to get dream you from ecstatic, depressed or enraged to completely neutral! Does that really sound like anyone from our world?
Omori: ***continues to drink black coffee while flipping Sunny off***
Sunny: See!? ***turns to Omori*** also there’s no need to be rude...
omori: ***stare*** (shut up you know you would be dead without me)
Sunny: ***stares back*** (You tried to kill me. And you wouldn’t even exist without me.)
omori:(well you wouldnt have created me if you werent a crybaby who didnt know how to deal with some hair with a eye)
Sunny: (No, I wouldn’t have created your body if not for that, you as a person wouldn’t exist if I had literally any other outlet I was brave enough to take. You’re literally the embodiment of all my angst.)
omori:(uuhhh, f you, **resets dream world)**
Sunny: (Who’s the crybaby now?)
***somewhere in white space, you hear a 12-yr old rage kid scream***
I am totally using this comment thread in an Omori fic if I ever figure out how to set the scene up.
i would draw this. . &#x200B;. . but i suck at drawing so i just imagine the scene
The fragance of black coffee
last words before sunny dies from a bash to the skull
Not sure how she’s gonna manage to do that to what is essentially the god of that world.
remember that sunny transferred ownership to omori
Ownership or not, it’s still in Sunny’s mind.
yeah you are right, but the image of a stressed out sunny seeing a nailed bat going to his head is hilarious nonetheless
He’d probably breakdown crying and repeatedly say sorry even though he’d be in no danger if he saw her about to hit him with a nailed bat, which would probably not sit well with his Dream friends
that or he calms down and will just casually pull off the kitchen knife
I wonder how it feels to become toast.
Sunny is going to explain a lot to Aubrey :D But looking at her she seems kinda happy about it ;D
I was thinking about this in a daydream a while ago.  . . . Thanks and good job for making it a reality!
Fanfic pls. . Friends within and without ended so I need more of this
I would also like a fanfic
Meanwhile Sunny and Omori are either giving each other the stink eye to ensure that the other doesn't say or do anything that might ruin everything. . . OR . . Sunny is desperately holding Omori back mentally from killing real world Basil while coming up with explanations for Basil and Aubery. also Dream mari if she asks something she shouldn't that'll make Omori try and kill them all  harder.
Meanwhile. Omori:. . Sunny: . . Omori: *dramatically points dull knife at Sunny*. . Sunny: *dramatically pulls out violin*
something: **panicked because doesnt know wich of them to choose**
Sunny: "Nah it's cool, why do u think I brought them here?"
that "Hahaha" kinda sends lmaoo
SO CUTE AHYDVJYY7HF
Sunny and Omori: >!Intense violin noises!<
Alternative response from my previous comment:. . **Sunny hands Aubrey a knife**. . Sunny: “All I ask is that you make it quick.”
Ok this is adorable
y'all saying that sunny and omori would be fighting to death . . i say:. . sunny: hello. . omori: hello. . sunny: sorry for beating you down. . omori: its ok, thanks to that im retired
Shit went from zero to a hundred real quick

Incredible cosplay. . Now you need to find your own Sunny and do a recital together 👀
There was a Sunny there but no recital this time
>!The sunny one was supposed to have a bruised eye ...!<
FUUUCK i edited this for like 2 hours how did i forget TT. . >!let's just pretend he fully recovered mkay!<
yes..
Sunny: “…life is tough, okay?”. . Aubrey: “Okay, but at least get something else to eat while you’re depressed, why not pizza?”. . Sunny: ***immediately whips out his phone and begins ordering Pizza Hut***
ayo the pizza here flashbacks

Done.

i wouldnt consider stabbing yourself "dying in your sleep"
Censor this
This entire post is spoiler tagged and this is a discussion sub . . If you are on here without knowing the endings thats just your own fault
wake up, guilt, hallucinations, sleep, happy place, repeat
This should be on a poster

That fookn scarred me that was so fucked up
Feels bad man
LMAOOOOOO
Thats why he took matters into his own hands, or feet in this case.
Ah relatable
real.
Neat observation. White Space is a mental safe space for Sunny so it makes sense he'd make it somehow resemble something that made him calm/happy, even if it's subconscious
Seems like Sunny ran out of ideas.
Sunny: Um, actually, i do re-. . Omori: ***Shut.***
Omori:JUST ACT NATURAL,JUST ACT NATURAL,YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.
I already told you, this is normal.
that drawing of sunny do be lookin great tho
snuuy
Sunny lookin kinda thick
Indeed (not really, he just looks naturally gay)
"naturally gay"
Yes very much indeed
r/biirl
Thicc
That is the least heterosexual pose that Sunny could do for a pic
indeed XD
*Oh Sunny!*,a Omori comedy!Playing now in theatres in Binch City!
sunny? more like sussy
a sussy baka
Sunny lookin kinda thick
a thick boy haha XD
Oh my gosh, I literally saved the original to my phone specifically because it made me think of Sunny.
Gotta say it, sunny be sexy af ngl
Sunny lookin cute ngl
Sunny could not have picked a more gay pose
>!Sorry if I make any spoilers for saying this but.....I think this would be Sunny after "Sayonara" by YareyareDaze, ¿why I feel that I have predicted the future?.!<
I will say, OMORI could use an option to super-speed through text or flat out skip cutscenes. I’m on my fourth and fifth play-throughs of OMORI right now (cleaning up achievements on SUNNY’s route, and setting up a hikikomori route to show my friend the bonus bosses bc we are playing a SUNNY route together) and the dialogue (especially for side stuff) tends to drag on after the second playthrough lmao
OMIRI Dishonored SUNNY
You can choose to not attack with Sunny, only Kel. If you win the fight like this, Sunny will not slash Aubrey. So it's up to the player's choice.
So you can keep the knife the entire playthrough? Broken
He was trying to say that a slash is different from a stab, Sunny only slashed Aubrey, if he had stabbed her she would probably have gone to a hospital and Sunny would be sleeping in prison space.
This is simply Sunny's way of expressing love
>!committing assault?!<
Yes.
Bro has some messed up kinks
Actually, it depends. There's a choice of not attacking with Sunny in the fight, only Kel. If this happens you won't stab Aubrey, but she will still flee due to being afraid of Sunny's knife.
Let’s be real, Everyone stabbed her our first go
I did but you better believe I reverted saves immediately afterwards
Bruh I played it out until she was sent to the hospital but I wanted to see the difference
But she didn’t go to the hospital at any point
Yeah, i did it too. But it's still optional, even though many people (me, included) didn't know at the time.
"It was just self defense i swear". . - Sunny who just wants his knife back
I wanted the knife back after having to deal with the Pet Rock Champion, honestly.
Sunny really ket himself go after the events of omori huh
Staring at the theater screen just for Sunny to go "it's right behind me, isn't it" when something appears. . 
Now imagine Jack Black as Sunny.
"i... omor 💀" sunny hears in the distance as he falls asleep for the last time
Sunny: **does that mean there's a female version of me or-**
No, it's Omori's egg route. Where Sunny transitioned either before or after >!Mari died!<.
anyway they both look cute 



Why is it named egg route?
Probs because "egg" is usually a term used for people that are trans and just haven't quite gotten the memo yet even if they do/say/believe some things that might be indicative of it (for example, thinking that you would love to be a boy/girl)..  I believe it's mostly used in a past sense: "oh i was such an egg back then" or at someone else in a joking manner.
Thx for the answer
"Egg" is a popular term in the trans community for people who are trans but in denial about it.
Got it, I think I was an egg then and never knew, thanks for the info
I like to think that this actually happened while sunny had an identity crisis or something similar while sleeping
Sunny's head when he starts questioning his gender.
ok people still remember female sunny and omori okay good
ok im gonna fight sunny w/ >!my gang!<. . >!damn sunny got a pepper spray wtf!<
Nice. . Edit: Welp, it was fun while it lasted 😐
My favorite thing about that is that they have the self awareness to realize that, yeah, Sunny pulling a knife or pepper spray is entirely fair game, since Aubrey has a fucking nailbat and they were fighting Sunny and Kel 3-1, respectively.
Wait what do you mean there was >!pepper spray!<. . . . EDIT: I do not understand how spoilering works
Nah, it's actually surprisingly hard to hit internal organs meaningfully unless you get lucky and have some proper body body strength. Considering Sunny is rail thin and doesn't exactly get much exercise, he probably only gave her a minor fleshwound. She probably didn't even need stitches.
Oh.. I just thought spleen was a funny word! :)
Understandable, have a nice day.
"Sunny!  Why are you using actual ass weapons?". . "Why did you come at me with a fucking spiked bat yesterday and try to actually jump me with your whole gang today?"
DAMn sunny got a KNIFE
SUNNYS SO TINY COMPARED TO HIM I CANT
5'2 moment
His main source of trauma is that >!he thinks Sunny murdered Mari on purpose and he didn’t have the mental faculties to deal with that so he suppresses the reality and makes Sunny out in his mind as a little angel!<
You're almost right, but it isn't just that >!he sees sunny as a little angel. That's part of it, but not the whole truth. Both Basil and Sunny created SOMETHING out of their denial of what happened. Something is their scapegoat, they know deep down that it was Sunny, but instead Something replaces Sunny because their young minds can't fathom the truth. They are referencing Something being the one who did all the damage. Something killed Mari, Something blacked out the album with black marker. By creating an antagonist, they can continue to escape from the truth and avoid accepting it. Basil and Sunny can blame something for what happened!<
You’ve gotta put the !< at the end too.
He’s not stupid.. . He was just a 12 year old who’s innocence instantly died and he was doing everything he could to claw it back
In that case, only Sunny would be .... ya know... ded
Sunny get the banana.
Sunny increasing his KDR
So Headspace is a place created by Sunny. He created it via lucid dreaming, right? I want to created a world like that when I sleep. It's looks really beautiful.
What a Sunny plush
>!replace Mom with Something and this is just Sunny's lifestory.!<
Atleast I have knitted low quality sunny plush
Sunny, age 11: >!"I hate murderers!"!<
*Transforms into piano*
>!hahahahha I'm gonna go cry!<
Hey, if you're actually 11 don't go around telling people on reddit, or anywhere else on the internet, bad stuff can happen.. . Edit: Mission accomplished, let's keep children safe around here if we can.
Also pretty sure Reddit is 13+
i am pretty sure Omori is 18+
No it's not
16+ ?
Pretty sure it's actually 13+ but heavily heavily reccomended to be 16+
Yeah probably
At least in the US, there isn't any kind of law against any age playing Omori, but the target audience is probably around 16+.
so i'm really not trying to sound condescending here (like i get it, as a kid i was lying about my age to get in sites i shouldn't be on yet too) but maybe don't be on reddit?. . there's some very adult content on here. sometimes without any warning. not to mention that to use reddit, you have to be at least 13, so you might get banned.. . and your age is personal information! just like you shouldn't go around sharing your full name online, you should not share your age either. i know the internet feels safer now, but there are still a TON of bad people online, and nowadays it's even easier to track someone down. just be careful.
This this this! I’m above the age to use Reddit and it still feels a little too old for me, in a way. The fact thst sometimes I just get… videos of dead people. Makes me feel like I’m too young sometimes.
Sorry to be that person buuuuut...Sunny was 12 when that happened as his 12th birthday already passed in the photo album.
Sunny: I hate Omori!. . Also Sunny: >!becomes Omori!<. . Sunny, again: >!kills Omori!<

Hero: I am not crazy! I know he killed her too. I knew it was 12/16. One after Magna Carta. As if I could ever make such a mistake. Never. Never! I just - I just couldn't prove it. He covered his tracks, he got that idiot flower boy to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. Like Mari! Are you telling me that she just happened to die like that? No! He orchestrated it! Sunny! They hung her dead corpse! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. Rescued him from drowning! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't take responsibility for his actions! But not our Sunny! Couldn't be precious Sunny! Killing them blind! And HE gets to be a free man? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you, you have to stop him! You -

I know the intent of this post, but I find it more funny and more in character for Sunny to be the one killed in this context.
oh hell nah bro, ig we are not gonna play from sunny's perspective then
"Your girl"?. . Mf sunny ain't pullin no hoes 💀💀💀🗿🗿🗿
The bitch I pulled by being autistic
sunny: why do i keep accidentally killing women i love.........this is a weird running theme oh well omori we're running away from reality again.

Not that but ok
Ik but it was the closest I could see
Ik. I was going to comment it but it looked like i didn't likethe comment
Np
Omori 2 where >!Hero beats Sunny to death with a golf club at the start and Aubrey has to chase after him to avenge Sunny's death.!<

... That was a very bad idea
Sunny got a 2.0 k/d ratio

Oh wow didn't even realize that
Seconded
Destroy the child.

Spoiler tags can't have spaces between the text. . . `>!like this!<`
Must be a browser thing. Works fine on Reddit app and your example is actually not spoilered on the app….   . Fixed it for you anyway though.
Must be. My example wasn't spoilered since it was in a code block. I did that so it would show the formatting.
Understood.
>!We don't know wether Sunny's eye can recover or not. Maybe it's just injured and eventually heals just fine!<
>!just Sunny actually.!<
I vibe with Snuuy's outfit ngl
In my headcanon SUNNY will become a writer of fantastic stories thanks to his imagination.
Sounds like a good idea for Sunny, he'll be a great surreal novel writer/artist. (This fanart is just my own interpretation, I'm open to read you guy's ideas )
Why does Sunny look like JD from Heathers
Sunny doesn’t like the violin so he should have been something else like a self defense expert.
>!sunny having his eye bugs me!<
the idea of sunny being a violinist is really heart warming.
But Sunny doesn't like the violin..
why does sunny has his eye tho 🤔🤔
Omg, Sunny looks like a younger, shorter version of Graves from Hustle Cat!
Sunny reminds me of a certain scene in Spiderman 3
>!Im surprised Sunny isn’t missing his right eye, unless he got a glass one later on!<
>!why does sunny have both of his eyes?!<
Is it just me or does Sunny look like Edwards Scissorhands?
>!doubt that sunny would enjoy picking up the violin, he never was cut out for it in the first place, he didn't like to practice. and with the added trauma (he repressed the instruments existence in his house for 4 years) iono if this what he needs!<
Basil: I don't believe in the Second Amendment, Sunny. It's stupid!. . Sunny: *pumps shotgun*  . Then you'll die as the Founding Fathers envisioned it!
I'll do you one better, Sunny roles up with a musket.
Redcoat Sunny, redcoat Sunny
Tis bit of scratch now innit?. . The blondie best count his hours to thou worketh free life! Else he'll be having a hole in his chest by seventeen o'clock!. . (Laughs in British)
Sunny: "My inner demons? I've dealt with them already."
And then John was a zombie.
SUNNY NO
The quote is by Sunny Tzu not Sun Tzu
Sunny is just like "oh shit not again"
it’s normal
sunny is looking as if this happens every day
Wait a minute. Who’s that just below sunny
look at sunny oh my god he is blushing so hard that's adorable
L-look a bit below him...
he's blushing not scared
BOTH, I think both, scary sunny is just pale, and here is pale and also blushing, but anyways, looks cute in any cases
i like sunny with white eyes
Yo this is some sick artwork. . Omg sunny 😆
>!Wait but how does Sunny not have the eye cut tho!<
>!Glass eye !<
>!Oooh and the reason he has no scar is bc he put on makeup!<
>!Oooh and the reason he has no scar is bc he put on makeup!<
Sunny looks so cute
>!Love the way Sunny is looking at lil Something lmao-!<. . >!"What in heavens are you doing here?!"!<
Looks super good, the only thing I’d change is not having sunny on the boxart, I’d think it’d be kind of a spoiler.
I agree with you!  I was thinking about it A LOT when making this, but in the end I went with the half-half one
Understandable, not like it’s real anyway so idk why this is cause for debate for people
It’s not that much of a spoiler imo. If it was my first time seeing it, I would’ve just assumed it’s a colored version of the mc in a horror part of the game.
Sir you see sunny half an hour in
Well yeah but ( I may be wrong) but it's never said that it's all a dream world in the start of the game so its something you figure out early but still kind of a spoiler
There’s a difference in what a “spoiler” is to people on r/omori and people who are picking up a new game.  To us, Sunny isn’t a spoiler.  To someone picking up a new game, this cover clearly indicates the protagonist is torn between two worlds, one of which seeming slightly more wacky and uncharacteristic than the other.. . Sure, you see Sunny in two hours or so, but that doesn’t mean it’s not an important plot device that should remain hidden until you find it in-game.
That's just the premise of the game though. It's like how Luke Skywalker being a Force User isn't really treated as a spoiler by Star Wars fans because it was never meant to be a twist.
For real. Sunny's existence was never meant to be a big twist. He was right there even in the very first trailer of the game and we meet him within the first hour. If Sunny was introduced midgame and we switch to playing as him for the entire second half of the game, now that would have been a spoiler.
How is that a spoiler when Sunny's existence has never been treated as such by the trailers and the promotional materials? Even the kickstarter campaign made it clear that you'd be alternating between dream world and real world.
This is a very well-edited cover! The other comments regarding the mock ESRB rating (mainly jokes about how the air conditioning WTF event would bump it up to an M rating) had me thinking, though. After researching the ESRB rating system's website, I think this rating would be more accurate:. . T (Teen) -  Blood and Gore, Language, Suggestive Themes, Violence. . Here's my reasoning:. . Blood and Gore - >!When Basil stabs Sunny in the eye during his battle, the icon shows Sunny bleeding. At first I was just going to say "Mild Blood" for this, but then I remembered there is also a sequence in Black Space in which Sunny's fingers are being severed one by one, with both the hand shown on screen and Sunny's overworld sprite becoming more and more bloody. Since there's dismemberment, Blood and Gore it is.!<. . Language - Most in-game dialogue has mild language at the most, but the air conditioning line's strong profanity bumps it up from Mild Language to standard Language. Since this is the only time an F bomb is dropped and not all playthroughs include this line of dialogue, I didn't think it would warrant enough for a Strong Language mark.. . Suggestive Themes - This descriptor is mainly used for mild sexual innuendos which could very well fit the subplot with >!Space Boyfriend and Sweetheart, along with the Slime Girls!<, but it could also fit in the general context of OMORI's dark themes.. . Violence - I was at first unsure whether this game would fall under Fantasy Violence, but the not-so-fantasy scenes in which>! OMORI (and Sunny, depending on the route you take) stabs himself, along with all the Mari business!< changed my mind fairly quickly. Scouring other T-rated games with similar content also labelled this under the Violence marking.. . And why Teen and not Mature? There are many other games with this kind of subject matter that have are rated T, and while there are a couple graphic scenes in the game, I personally thought that they weren't frequent enough to warrant an M rating >!(yes, this includes Black Space)!<. Also, the ESRB wouldn't put "psychological horror" on its label because it only uses descriptors from a set list to save time and give consumers an easy way to judge a game's content. So what do you guys think?
Very well said man!  I put the psychological horror thing there just cause that tag just hits you different lmao.  But if it were the official thing, what you said could very well be the official one if it comes out!
interestingly enough, they dismissed gore, and bumped it up to strong language.
I was going by the 1996-2000 hypothesis, which is probably the most popular headcanon for when the game takes place. According to that hypothesis, Mari would be born in 1981 and Sunny in 1984. for Sunny to be named after Sonic he would have to be born at least in 1991, which means the game would have to take place around 2007, which coincidentally is when funny movie came out. Also coincidentally, the second most popular headcanon for when the game takes place is 2006.. . 
it was (sort of) confirmed that the game takes place sometime in the 2010/20s
When? The recital ticket?
yes  . the two Xs at the end makes me believe the year has two digits at the end  . which is why i landed on 2010s or 20s.
Since it is implied that they're asian, it would be funny if their last name was "Chu" because Sunny's full name would be "Sunny Chu" which sounds a bit like... [you know]((character)). . edit: it works surprisingly well too since y'all like to headcanon Sunny as autistic
Cwcville is a whack-ass headspace
Someone pls make a edit of this
NO.
What if Sunny was named after Wing of Fire Sunny?
If Sunny = Sonic . . Then Snuuy = Sniic?
Hello Sunny from the hit game OMORI :)
Hello NewAlternative2620 (Sunny Flair) from the hit location 40.0384° N, 76.1075° W
That is an... interesting location
Hello The69FlyingDuck from the truman show
Hello FOOD4U from hit game super smash bros
Do I count as a normal boy, oh holy sunny?
Your a femboy/Catboy. . But its ok
Thank you very much, Sunny.
“No, Sunny. I’m not going to let you suck on my toes.”

*Adopts Both and Claymori*. . “You three are now brothers with Sunny!”. . : Ah shit, here we go again.
Ok here me out guys, the entire point of Omori is that embracing fantasy and leaving behind the real work only brings pain in the end. By choosing the fake Omor you are just as bad as Sunny. Accept change.. . Am I looking too deep into this? Probably.
I suddenly imagined sunny vs omori but sunny is omori and omori is official and its the bad ending
In Brasil it’s always a Sunny day... right?
*ba dum tss*

Oh...GUESS WHAT?  . . . IT JUST BURNED AT MY PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!! CUZ OF OVERLY SUNNY!!!!!!!!!
"Look sunny I forgive you.. i- I just wanna rest for a bit ok?.. so is this when you wanna pinch your cheek or somethin-"

Looks like an album cover, and I love it.
reminds me of this . . 
DRIP SUS
AMOGUS?????
Why does she have a bloody nose?
•Learns that friend is living in a fake reality inside his head. . •Somehow enters said fake reality. . •Brutally murders everything on sight on cold blood. . •Friend is free. . 
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|surprise)Holy shit what a sigma female!
Holy Mcquakerlicous! What a surprise!
Just kill the trauma, forehead
I mean its nice killing the trauma I think…
Bitches be like: "I need to face my demons, come to terms with my mistakes and forgive myself in order to move on." . . MY BROTHER IN CHRIST: NAILED BAT 
KILL THE TRAUMA 
Now i want a playable form of this, maybe as a ultrakill mod.
[THIS IS THE SOURCE!]()
i thought you draw this 
. . (She is going to do a bit of killing)
(She is about to beat Omori to dead)
. . \^ He is unaware of his fate.
: I am the god of destruction!!. . : do you have any idea how long it’s gonna take me to imagine me fixing all this
about to drop the hardest single of 2023
Again I think an interesting AU is that the real world and headspace are merging
Does Sunny’s real friends going into his Headspace count? If so, Losing my mind and Peaceful Morning.
You should try writing it , have hope in yourself
. . >!**…the Pink Inferno within this bastion? Something must have gone wrong, no one should have been able to speak, much less contact the Dreamer in this place… a quick expulsion of her from the Dreamer’s mind will not be the safest method in removing her, with Sunny still attached to her through these years, but maybe I can drag her as well to forgo reality?**!<
gold
: yes, I'm high
yknow Ive always liked the scenario where Aubby somehow makes it into Sunnys mind and spawns in the White Space and must reach Red Space in order to free Sunny from his mental trance via fucking beating the shit up of whatever stupid enough to stand between her and Sunny including all the bosses from all routes, the dream version of Sunnys friends, all the Something abominations and Omori itself across Headscape and Black Space 1 and 2 with DOOM music in the background 
\*She is about to destroy Sunny's delirious fantasies and sent him back to reality\*
you'll never know
Aubrey might figure out Sunnys old crush for her
She already knows . . But... she finds more.
: You have 10 seconds. . : put me down
: Sunny, what the hell is this!?. . ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|dizzyface): i-i can e-explain!
: Who the frick are you!?. . : I'm you, you no-real cheap copy. . : Huh, the heck did you say you girl flop?. . ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|flipout) (They start to fight)
: \[both watching the fight unfold\]. . : temporary truce?. . : Yep... \[summons some popcorn\] Here's some popcorn... we're gonna be here a while
LMAO
uh I love her character design so much!!!! beautiful art btw! 

Walmart brand shoes
Better than most of what we get from this subreddit. Kudos.
Мне так поздно пришло уведомление через 10 дней я пишу это 28 июля это сообщение видимо вышло в 18 июля
yoooo new muse dash character
Top👏tier👏art👏
How did she get in there?!
THIS IS SO COOLL
HOW DID SHE GET HERE
She haves some secrets 
what she used a mshin to inter his brane. . SHIT AUBERY IS A CRASY INVONTOR COMFERMD
: \*sweating\*
She’s having a nosebleed someone help her
Nosebleed from stress i guess.



I love this idea!!! I wonder what the friends would laugh at Sunny most about?
So... is this your art? Cuz i fucking love it
Oh my God, the colors are so vibrant Ö! This is so awesome!!
 "Alright Sunny so when someone types "cope harder" how do you respond". .  "192.168.45.87". .  "Great job Sunny! You're a fast learner!"
that’s a local ip 😳

i was gonna say LOL.. the only thing you’ll get by typing that in is something on your own network (given it’s assigned that IP)
Wtf an actually right private IP address
I did research
I'm crying of happiness
Not exactly 4chan, but the premise of it is that Sunny spends his 4 years in isolation on forums and shit, and becomes an edge lord.. . I’ll look for it later. . Edit: [found it]()
Omoriboy 
Yep
It is official! It's from Sunny's birthday iirc
Sunny learns how to use he internet
Welcome to the Internet!
Have a look around 
Anything that brain of yours can think of can be found 
How was the fall?
: What am I saying?! I've done it! You are all to late! Sunny is a Twitter user! I have brainwashed him!. . : (buying a checkmark). . : Guys! We gotta save Sunny!
GET HIM!. . (Kel, Auby and Basil rushes towards Sunny). . Get off me you mid! You're all just jealous that ive ratioed all of you!. . STOP! DON'T BUY THE CHECKMARK! YOU'LL LOSE YOURSELF FOREVER!
: Praise Elon Musk!!!!. . : NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
>: (buying a checkmark). . :....ok he's officially gone too far, time to put him down.
\*You're (Damn, why tf Sunny is so cute in this pic?)
Bruh he is cute in almost every pic
I know but he looks particularly cute in this one.
True. I guess I just thought Snuuy’s inherent preciousness warranted mention.
You just need to say "Snuuy."
Fixed.
Better.
Sunny and Basil are basically give the 'I do not give a shit' vibe, especially Sunny. 
>!so would sunny!<
This is Sunny after coming to terms with his guilt, and his dream friends are happy for him even as they fade away
Congratulations!
Of course someone with sunny flair knows that
Says someone who also has the sunny flair (I'm only playing pls don't take it thr wrong wa)
Of course
YOU FOOL THIS CHAIN OF SUNNY’S SHALL BE STOPPED BY MY DECEASED FLAIR OF “😂 ANNOYING 😂 ORANGE 😂 JOE 😂 MAMA 😂“
Actually no
FUUU->!Le stairs have arrived!<
Sunny the hedgehog is a bitch ass motherfucker >!he hanged my fucking wife!<
and he said that his tree is THIS big
And I said that’s disgusting, so I’m making a call out post on Omoriboy’s Tumblr comics, Sunny the SisterMurderer, you got a small brain it’s the size of this walnut but way smaller(like fr you could have just checked her pulse of if she was breathing etc) and here’s what my brain looks like. (Mari’s expand your mind sprite thing blows up)
No Decay, no Stupid, Just brain!
"SUNNY"
“SUNNY” used Wake-Up Slap!. . Sunny woke up!
.... . well, I guess Sunny’s first kiss.... . ...was also his last kiss. (Puts on sunglasses) ***YEAAAAAAAAAAAAH***
The ambulance arrived, they’re taking Sunny to the hospital.. . The report came in, somehow having his first kiss put him in a coma.
Aumori ensues
Hopefully this hasn't been posted yet, anyways [here's the source!]()
Let's this be Canon
If it makes your day, it was stated SUNNY had a crush on AUBREY as kids. Later on in the game little hints where given that both still are inlove with each other wich I hope is true because it would make me happy
Yeah I hope its as true as you are a banana
If you believe it hard enough, its cannon
Cute!
Omori: ***Yeeeesssss!***
Sunny: shut up.
They're so precious!
F U C K I N G Y E S
*Sunny tags Aubrey*
That's adorable ngl
I need more
Ah fuck my heart cant take this
This is the stuff I live for,
Fuck yeah
I created a fanfic where the two of them stay together, Aubrey whenever he is the tough guy but her heart goes out to Sunny.
Link dude
This fanfic is imaginary.
Just like you were.
Sunny's going to jail because aubrey didnt consent
now, hear me out, how about sunny going for a surprise stab
'>!He has a STEAK KNIFE!!<'
Kel: “Isn’t that just a knife but extra?”. . Aubrey: “…yes?”. . ***Sunny, meanwhile, is dying of laughter in the background, having dropped the knife as a result of this***
SUNNY tagged AUBREY
Kinda creepy...
Cute but pretty OOC for Sunny.
Simply cute.
Except Sunny’s parents…
They rolled nat 20 on Deduction.
I'm gonna be a big nerd and say "Um, actually, deduction isn't a skill. That'd be insight".
Well it’s not like I’ve ever played DnD before. I’ve heard of it but it’s practically nonexistent in my country.
It's a fun experience. I recommend it. If you can't find anyone to play with, you can do what I do and watch other people play it whilst staring longingly to the horizon. If you want recommendations on who to watch, I'd say Critical Role or World of Io.. . But I wasn't blaming you or anything, I'm just an impulsive nerd.
All you had to say was "Dice and paper"
**Omori began their Insight work on Something.**
When Sunny and Basil failed their Wisdom Save, the DC for the Insight Check was reduced significantly.
Actually there was a super good post a bit ago that very well defended why Sunny’s parents knowing is unlikely,  unnecessary for their actions and even damaging to the plot.
If his parents don’t know then why didi his dad leave?
Because a child committing suicide in the family puts unimaginable pressure, pain, guilt and blame on the parents. They would both feel responsible and feel their partner is as well or hates them as well as a mass of other emotions. Suicide destroys families
needed milk
I'm of a mind that SUNNY's parents actually know he did it, since there's a scene in black space with a man cutting down the tree, saying "you're not my son"
Then she does a reverse backflip back on top to continue to lecture Sunny
or she slips on the violin
Imagine the plot of omori but sunny pushed her to the side instead
: only sunny is allowed to do that
what
 <- not Sunny
Reasons to dislike Sunny: he's a mute. Reasons to like Sunny: why he's mute
yes. . that's why we like him
I wouldn't bother to justify his actions, but sunny's still my favorite because I relate to him so much.
Hope you didnt >! kill your sister !<
Don't worry she's fine. : )
Kel still try to ask Sunny to hang out even after 4 years of Sunny isolating himself. He's the best bro anyone could ever ask.
Honestly the reason I like Sunny is just cus he’s relatable minus the >!murder your sister!< part
Yeah I know right? I find his anxiety and escapism deeply relatable, minus that part you mentioned.
Yeah
It was supposed to be a Sunny slander LMAO. . We'll justify being his simp even when he accidentally killed his sister and that he has weird fantasies about bullying rabbits
Fuck them rabbits.
I like sunny because his cheeks seem soft and squishable
sunny is like the shinji ikari of omori
i so badly want to know what sunny's side says
Sunny's my favorite because me and him have a lot in common. I get sad when he suffers as a result, because I see myself in his shoes even when I don't want to due to my heart needing a break. Seeing him happy is good for my physical and mental health.
Imo he deals with the situation better than everyone else. And then >!he's the one to reach out to sunny!< so he's just a good guy.
Sunny would probably drive like an old woman on the road
"Alright, Sunny, what's the first thing you do?"  . "1924?"  . "No, silly, you start the car."  . (Panicking sounds)  . "Calm down, Sunny! It's just a car!"
I feel like past the nervousness of first driving a car, Sunny would learn pretty easily once he learns it's not as scary as he thinks
Yeah except instead of killing anyone else that’s interested in them, he kills anyone that so much as blinks in a negative way towards Sunny.
After getting over his fears, Sunny drives like he's in an action movie, drifting around corners and going at top speed
I'm sunny and I'm driving around neighborhoods now
GET OFF YOUR PHONE WHAT THE HECK . EYES ON THE ROAD
no I meant im just in that stage of driving
oh ok, GOOD LUCK YOU GOT THIS
Oh god, Sunny is such a mood...
Why is Sunny me?
sunny driving is just gonna be that one bob's burger scene
Sunny is me when first learning to drive and me today holding my license for seven years.
I relate far too much to sunny.
Same here. Learning to drive was not fun for me.
Yeah I was like Sunny.
I've had my licence for 3 years now and I'm still Sunny
Sunny's favourite line while driving is:. . Life is meaningless
I was Sunny when I first started driving.
Sunny is too accurate. Too afraid to leave house, too afraid to leave parking.
Sunny vs Amaxophobia
sunny
sunny is the type of whippersnapper to be afraid of any vehicle or form of transport ever. Even like a scooter or smth
Sunny is a huge mood. When my parents attempted to teach me how to drive, I hadn't even touched the wheel and was already panicking
Sunny whitewashed himself. He purplepoured his friends.
something something blue myself
I am blue da ba dee da bu dai
da bu dee da bu dai
if I gren I die
lean moment
Oh-No Cat.
They are all lean demons in his mind lmao
This is the exact moment sunny developed a crush on her
You can pinpoint the exact moment sunny became heisensimp
Oravo Bmocat
based
Sunny really put the Snow app filter on all his headspace friends
Sunny has bathmophobia now laugh
Sunny and Lucas will get along. >! Both of their siblings are dead! Sunny pushed Mari, and Lucas didn't remove his Franklin Badge !<
sunny: hmm, maybe the stairs are better than a roof
The good ending is the one where they all kiss Omori because Sunny just wants love
In my headcanon i like to imagine what happen in the omori world is a representation of what happened to sunny in the real world . . (Yes trying real hard to give sunny some love)
We have a word Hikikomori – when people remove “Omori” the only thing left is “Hikik” so usually they just move the last “k” thus making it “Hikki”. For me though this shouldn’t be just senseless letter play – it should be the word play.   . 引きこもり/Hikikomori means “pulling inward” – describing “shut-in” people, while 重り/Omori – means “weight” – >!this is symbolic considering Omori’s role in Sunny’s mentality – he is that “weight” on Sunny’s shoulders that “will not succumb” no matter what and will try to “protect” him by not letting him reach the truth. !<   . So, what we have left… 引き/Hiki – just like in Hikikomori it means “pull” – isn’t it fitting? >!“Hiki pulls through” no matter what – even if that requires to “pull” her brother to his death when his push made her lost her balance because of her bad knee, even if her up the pole beloved suggests a radical plan to keep her safe, even if she ends up “pulling away” from her friends – that is Hiki – distorted image of Mari’s perfectionism.!<
Oh my God it all makes sense, thank you
I ship air conditioner and sunny
you are a blight upon humanity
They were together for like four years
I ship the stake whit sunny
 don't lie to me OMORI/ sunny... You wanted to fuck the dog to
: Sunny, I thought you swore to keep us a secre—. . : We’re dealing with a zoophile, all bets are off.
\*Three gunshots ring out as Sunny takes the initiative*
meanwhile.... .  OH THERE YOU ARE. .  GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME. .  GIMME DAT ASS
 Why are you here with me?! How did you die?!. . : you don’t want to know…
Yes, plus that’s probably the healthiest Sunny ship.
Ngl it prob is considering **OTHER** ships
Yup, far better than Suncest and Sunny Side Up.
And ballonons (Y’know which one))
I don’t know which ship you’re referring to, do I want to know?
Nope you don’t also I was searching sunny x kel on twitter and found well uhh can I dm you
it's called sunnyside up
Either way, due to the age difference, it’s really cursed. But I’ll give it this: Sunny Side Up is a really good name.
Sorry but sunny with Aubrey is the only ship sunny will get in the group basil and kel aren't gonna date eachother sunny or Aubrey I ship Mari and basil with Me
Godzilla had a stroke trying to read this and fucking died.
Damn Sunny
Ah SUNNY, you funny goofy, you little silly
It slightly clips over sunny's shoulder . . . Literally 0/10 worst image ever made /s
The interpretation of the game is free to the player, which is why it’s dumb to think that the game ever specifically characterizes or explicitly states that sunny is someone with DID since omori as his coping mechanism could just be a gigantic metaphor. I do think the community was wrong for gatekeeping, but to be fair it’s the Twitter part of the community and Twitter is a toxic wasteland. Mcyt handled the situation just as badly, however.
Yeah that's fair. The only reason I think that it could potentially be disassociative amnesia instead of just a metaphor for his grief/guilt is (mainly) because of the ending for the Hikikomori route, >!where you can clearly see him hesitate before committing, almost as if fighting against someone else from stabbing himself!<
Oh don’t take my words the wrong way, dissociative amnesia is an extremely realistic assessment of the plot of the game. I’m just saying that making the assumption that the game is able-ist based off of it SEEMING like it’s about DID or dissociative amnesia is just stupid, since the game is completely and entirely free to interpretation. It’s one of the reasons why the Twitter users who think the game is able-ist are kind of dumb, since we don’t know if sunny is entirely aware or unaware of his past actions. But, when you hypothetically assume that the game refers to dissociative amnesia, it aligns with sunny’s reactions in the game, the timeline of how the player learns the events of the past, etc.
I hate sunny now, thanks
ngl for Sunny a mental breakdown probably looks like that. . Besides that time where he grabbed his head in that one animation
This is gonna sound evil but I absolutely love the animation before Sunny gets Stressed Out.
I’m not the only one lol. It’s impressive from a technical standpoint and wonderfully expresses strong emotions. It’s a very nice piece of animation. Intense emotions are fun to portray and see in art imo
[Warning: I'm not sure if I did the reddit spoiler tag correctly- if I didn't; Spoiler ahead] . . They look like kids here to me, so my first thought was >!when we see Sunny push his sister!<. . Edit: OK yeah I did it correctly
he looks lowkey thirsty for sunny ngl
Wait **lowkey?!**
High key is minor
What's your favourite minor chord?
All of them
Z minor
Ach are you vone of ze Germans?
Nein.
Hmm does this mean Sunny was gonna emote or talk too? I doubt it but it's fun to imagine
That ain't the face I make when I'm distressed but it looks cool. . Also damn, Sunny do be making another facial expression other than a blank face
Pardon? All I said was Sunny looks punchable in that art. It’s not a big deal go get a life
I am far more concerned by smiling Sunny lol.
sunny looks like he has no idea whats going on
He is scared, (because mari is right behind sunny) Sunny is scared (because basil has a knife) and im scared because i forgot to water his flowers (i hear knocking on my door)
I love the fact that Sunny is so done with his older sis flirting with her boyfriend. Again. . . . BWHAHAHAHAHA
\*Omori. . . But yeah lol
Panels 1-5 Oh, how nice. . As soon as panel 6 appears: "Why must you hurt me in this way"
thank you so much!! im glad to have made you feel something :) !!
U made us feel everything
Yes, *something*
LOL im sorry :') i hope to convey a fraction of what the game made me feel :o
If the game made you feel a powerful emotional stab to the heart, you didn’t convey a fraction, for those who played the whole game, your comic gave us another whole stab and then some

Ah yes, my daily dosage of *emotional pain*
This is great! Btw what font did you use for the text?
thank you! i used the font i downloaded directly from the game's files :)
Sunny boy you deserve to be happy again
happiness and sadness in a single image
This is so well written. The fact that Sunny is dealing with that feels so real, and if you and Omocat had the same art style I would have *easily* mistaken this for being official. Best fan comic I've seen by far. I'm gonna go cry now.
thank you so much ❤️
thank you :)
I am sad now
Aight so this one really really got me. I don't normally post on reddit but this one was really good. My fiance of what would be 15 years now passed away 4 years ago. She was older than I was. Turning 24 was my hardest birthday cause I was older than her. Now I'm turning 27. Good comic.
i’m so sorry for your loss. thank you for sharing such an important part of your life with me, even for just a moment. i wish you all the best in the future. ❤️
Yes’s it.
"you're not supposed to be older than she could've been" that line hit so hard, I can't deal with this--
OW MY HEART UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Oh my god you absolutely tugged at my heart strings tysm for this
. . Live snuuy reaction
: Omori!!! Where are those hands taking me?. . : "".. . : I thought we were friends!. . : "".
 “Oh yes…we were…”
Keywords: were
: “W-why do you look so scared?”. . 
I trust you, SUNNY.
SUNNY wouldn’t say that it’s safe to go in the blender, >!SOMETHING behind him said that!<
Sunny: *aggressively presses E*
#MEDIC!
Manic be like:oh my sunny u have grown~
yeah alot of the manic faces we've seen on this template have looked weirdly sexual taken out of context
Not like the canon game helped out with that impression. Ecstatic Omori already look like he's on drugs as it is, Manic is a couple redrawn eyes away from being an ahegao face
why -. . why did you comment this
Considering maniac is sunny bottled up emotions exploding in happiness, this actually make much sense
i think this comment has cursed my bloodline
Uh-
you are right for some reason
Well the duologue before his fight is him yelling at sunny not to leave him. So not to out of character
Wouldn't say it's yandere to want an understanding shoulder to cry on, but I get what you mean, haha
pov: sunny neutral ending
Pov: all endings
Go outside now. . Even Sunny go outside more than you
Omori too.
I mean, it’s probably just my interpretation, but I feel the dream world thing is not too crazy considering how crazy actual lucid dreams can be. Like if Sunny was a natural lucid dreamer I don’t think it’s too unreasonable to believe he could imagine an entire world to play out his escapism in.
Thats what it comes down to in the end huh. As life of pi says "its all about the act of letting go and saying goodbye".. . Mari and sunny loved each other dearly so the thought their last moment together was a fight is hard to bear. Thats why i cope lawl. Hoping her soul still loves him and says its Allright and that he can know it. Aka what we dont get irl. . Also a reminder to always treasure your family and those you love and care about.. . You never know what might happen. Having your last encounter be a bad one can haunt you like something did to sunny.
*SUNNY hugs EEVEE.*
..... what has my life become
*sunny wishes you a wonderful day.*. . :)
reading this thread makes me feel more emotions
*sunny hugs you.*
what what what why is the sunny child hugging me now
*because hug.*
Never forget about the fanfic on Ao3 that's literally nothing more than trying to treat the Omori drip meme as a serious AU where Sunny has all the money in the world but is still depressed af  . . . And by never forget I mean just check out, [here's the link]()
Can you send it to me? Asking for a friend
I just added the link to my first comment, the world needs to see this
Hey thanks for reading my story.. . If ya have any feedback on it lemme know and I hope ya have a great day.
I LOVE YOUR FICS, THANK YOU!
Glad ya like em. Thank you for reading.
If you have any feedback on them I would be happy to hear it
I love you both
Great vibe, especially Sunny
Sunny's letting off some gnc af vibes in this image ngl.
just went down the rabbit hole of figuring out what that meant, funniest shit i’ve ever seen
Sunny looks like a Kpop star I can't-
Sunny has drip
Just burn sunny and it evolves into a different ship
And he'll become a Sun

How to rescue sunny from a fire. . Step 1: kill him with anything but fire so he doesn't die by fire, therefore making him "rescued".
Ah, so if he does get burned, it's just a cremation!

Omg that's me . . I'm famous
Everyone tags Sunny (except Omori).
id either be brazil or sunny
I see the immense genius behind Sunny’s method
Sunny:. . # STOP..! I'M SUFFOCATING..!!!
no
Oh no, the juice is coaxing Sunny into a snafu.
*I get Godhead on Sunny's save file and he stops being sad both because I somehow came back from the dead and freed him from the challenge of the lost... But he became sad again when realising he needed JnE unlocks*
wow, you're bad making Sunny happy
*I teach Sunny how to play JnE and he manages to unlock rock bottom, Damocles, birthright and other less overpowered unlocks and gets happy again*. . Now I hope he doesn't find out about tainted lost

really love this art, omoris more sinister look contrasting everyone else is a really cool detail, i always love art showing headspace as a drug to sunny
“Sunny… take your meds!”
The fandom thinks so for the same reasons: is more feminine,shy and has an unhealthy attachment for Sunny. Obviously, they're all not just pointless, but are harmful, they reinforce stereotypes of gay people and in some way even the concept of toxic masculinity
The "unhealthy attachment to Sunny" excuse people use doesn't even make sense. . . Like... he... doesn't even have an unhealthy attachment? Dude even avoids hanging out with Sunny as much as he can in the three days we see him
The circumstances are too odd and extreme to tell whether it's "unhealthy" or not but he is pretty obviously attached. He has a meltdown over Sunny moving away. Twice. Basil only seems distant because Sunny was distant for 4 years after Basil tried to contact him over and over.. . That's why he says . . >It's nice to see that you're still around... . even if it's only for a little while.. . Even before he knows Sunny is moving. He assumes he's shutting himself in again.
I read that line as foreshadowing that Basil was going to kill himself. He gives Sunny his memory book, and he kills himself off-screen in the Hikkiomori route, so we know he was going to kill himself unless someone intervened. But your reading is valid anyways.
Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all
I'm not arguing against that, just saying this. . >Dude even avoids hanging out with Sunny as much as he can in the three days we see him. . doesn't really prove it's not an unhealthy attachment.
If it was an unhealthy attachment, he would be jumping at the opportunity to hang out with Sunny as much as possible, would he not?
dude couldnt get over sunny not staying with him even after 3 years, pr sure thats kinda unhealthy
Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all
aha good point
Pretty sure that's more to do with the fact he was left to hide the truth on his own and was already in the edge of suicide before Sunny came out.
>Basil was already in the edge of suicide before Sunny came out. . Very fitting with the topic of the post
Godammit I knew that wording was gonna get called out
☠
ok good point i see the reasoning
between >!covering up sunny's murder, being emotionally devastated at the news he was leaving, and all that!<. . &#x200B;. . don't you think he's just a ***\*weee*** bit clingy?
No? . . . He was scared >!sunny would get into trouble, and did what he did to protect him!< . This doesn't come off as clingy at all. . >being emotionally devastated at the news he was leaving. . Literally a completely normal response to your close friend moving away. Especially when you and said friend are >!the only ones aware of a huge secret, and the only ones who share a connected trauma!<
>!I request you watch [this scene]() again and come back to me saying it’s not unhealthy in the slightest bit!<
It's not unhealthy dude. Maybe unhealthy in other ways, but not in attachment. You're literally trying to say a 16 year old having some sort of anxiety attack while he's >!contemplating suicide!< has an unhealthy attachment to a friend of his who he found out just a day ago is moving away
>!Gonna quote one of your earlier comments to make a point here.!<. . >>!Having an emotional reaction to your friend you haven't seen for 4 years moving away with no warning beforehand, especially when you share a traumatic history with them makes his reaction understandable. It doesn't read as an "unhealthy attachment" at all!<. . >!Taking a bit of a shot in the dark here but "understandable" and "unhealthy" can coexist. You write it like the fact that it's an understandable reaction considering the circumstances(and it is) negates that.!<. . >!The dialogue when Sunny tries to leave Basil's room seems proof enough: "Where are you going!? Stop trying to leave me! S-Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!" ... "No... You wouldn't leave me. That's not like you, Sunny! It's something behind you again, isn't it?"!<. . I'm not saying this isn't understandable given all the circumstances. But it isn't a *healthy level of attachment.*
Of course they can, but I moreso meant it as he had a reason for acting the way he did, and it very clearly didn't have anything to do with him bring clingy or having an unhealthy attachment. . . He was very clearly having some sort of breakdown or anxiety attack. After finally seeing a friend after 4 years only for them to leave so soon when you have a deeply shared trauma and understanding, his reaction is warranted and has nothing to do with being clingy
I mean everyone’s different, but my personal first thought wouldn’t be >!holy shit. I gotta stage this tragic accidental death to look like a suicide so my best friend doesn’t get into trouble.!<
agree to disagree
I admit i may be totally wrong, i thought that because >!when sunny talks to him before moving, he stated that sunny was too god for killing Mari, plus the whole stabbing Sunny's eyes part!<  . But your comments kinda changed my mind about it
Disagree. It’s not the headcanon-ers who need to change, it’s the people who actually believe all gay people are like that and believe every stereotype they see who need to change.
He isnt feminine though he's just a shy and timid **child** who's main hobby is gardening, I dont see why people think hes feminine at all.
unironically this, its like saying farmers are gay for growing plants
I don’t really care about the first two reasons just the Sunny part idk what everyone else is thinking
He's a feminine boy that is depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend in both the game and promotional material, paired up with said friend in content that similarly pairs up the canon couple, unhealthily idolizes his best friend and even has hair that visually contrasts Sunny's, a trait common in gay characters from anime such as Evangelion and Berserk.. . Considering OMOCAT is a self-proclaimed fujoshi and has made a yaoi comic that blatantly features some of these elements, and considering her other comic's protagonist heavily inspired OMORI's protagonist, I find it hard to believe all this is a coincidence and wasn't at least a little bit intended by her.. . I'm not saying it isn't problematic to always say a feminine character is gay (Deltarune fans do this a lot even when said feminine character is not at all attracted to men and only showed attraction to a girl and an enby and it really annoys me lol), but this specific feminine character seems to be intentionally queer-coded by the author, so I'd say it's ok this time
Liking gardening =/= feminine. Either way, using evidence of him being "feminine" as a way to put a sexuality onto him enforces harmful stereotypes.. . >depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend. . Have you mfs never had friends? Like, seriously. Hugging people you're close to and holding their hands doesn't automatically mean there must be romantic feelings involved. . >unhealthily idolizes his best friend. . He does not do this. But again, even if he did, that doesn't hint to any romantic feelings at all.. . >hair that visually contrasts Sunny's, a trait common in gay characters from anime such as Evangelion and Berserk.. . How far do you have to reach bro what. Aren't your arms hurting?. . Omocat did make both fujo and fudanshi merch, but I have not seen any evidence of herself admitting she is one. Using this as evidence for characters being gay doesn't really work when said characters show no romantic feelings for each other, and one of them is even shown to have a crush on a female character. Basil also appeared completely fine with Sunnys crush on Aubrey
Basically, you almost said all the stuff i already said in my first comment.. . . >He's a feminine boy. . That doesn't mean nothing, there are straight feminine boys. . . >depicted holding hands and hugging his best friend in both the game and promotional material, paired up with said friend in content that similarly pairs up the canon couple. . You never held hands with a friend of yours? Never hugged one of them? Does that mean you love them?  Plus, they're crucial to the whole premise of the game and share a trauma, it's normal to put them together in official art . . >unhealthily idolizes his best friend. . Which is not even related to romantic feelings. . . . >Considering OMOCAT is a self-proclaimed fujoshi and has made a yaoi comic that blatantly features some of these elements, and considering her other comic's protagonist heavily inspired OMORI's protagonist, I find it hard to believe all this is a coincidence and wasn't at least a little bit intended by her. . I don't understand the whole concept of indirectly saying it, i mean there are some couples and sunny is shown to have a crush for Aubrey. Plus, the fact she sold fujoshi merch in the past is not a solid evidence for it. . In the end, i have nothing against headcanons or ships, but forcing them as canon, especially when justified with stereotypes, is not a good idea
>You never held hands with a friend of yours? Never hugged one of them?. . Not unless I was really intimate with them or it was a really special circumstance, no.. . >sunny is shown to have a crush for Aubrey. . Oh yea fair enough. . >Plus, the fact she sold fujoshi merch in the past is not a solid evidence for it. . Yeah the places where I saw people say she was a self-proclaimed fujoshi did not list ANY sources for that claimm and she vehemently denied it when asked about it, I should've looked deeper into it, mb. . >i have nothing against headcanons or ships. . Cool, I don't think a gay basil could actually work in the base game without at least altering a few scenes, so I don't actually think it's canon, at best it's a headcanon without that many things that directly contradict it. It seems this discussion was madde out of a complete misunderstanding, and as such I'm really sorry!
Don't worry, it can happen,i admit that sometimes things heat up too much in a fandom and it's hard to understand who thinks what
I mean I think he’s queer just because of his attachment to Sunny, I don’t really care about his “””feminime manners”””. + I relate to him a lot so I just automatically pretend he’s canonically queer… whoops
as long as it stays a headcanon and isn't used as a fact, then it's okay
Having a friend of the same gender = gay. . You cannot have an attachment to a friend without having romantic motives involved . . . Okay got it, taking notes
Well I’ve always felt that they were more than friends, but it’s my perception! Maybe you see them differently, and it’s totally fine and valid. I didn’t say that friends loving each other = relationship, and I would never believe that
>I’ve always felt that they were more than friends. . Bitch where 💀
I could explain my reasoning but it would be worthless: I wouldn’t change your mind about it. I just stand by my harmless opinion and don’t annoy anyone who thinks differently. I just shared my thoughts and if you think they’re dumb or senseless it’s completely fine, just don’t try and take down my views on a fictional character of a videogame. Have a wonderful day
Ok this is better than thinking he's gay because he's "feminine" but.... . . >+ I relate to him a lot so I just automatically pretend he’s canonically queer…. . Please don't. This is when shit gets bad in fandoms. Remember it isn't canon. . (Before anyone asks i've been in too many fandoms and have seen this pattern before with people not separating hcs from canon so i'm saying it now)
 I can separate headcanons from canon, my wording might have been confusing. Sorry for that
Is he gay or European?. . Sunny: "Well hey don't look at me!"
Personally I feel like people taking contention with Sunny and Basil being shipped together puts a negative stigma to same sex friendship when Sunny and Kel, and Aubrey and Kim already exist as other same sex friends is more telling. Like there are already other platonic relationships, let the gays have some fun.
...yeah, it's almost as if Basil is saying he wants to move past the trauma, and fix things to create new happy memories. It especially means a lot to Basil since he talks about how he cherishes his memories, and takes photos of what he's scared to lose.. . . Not to mention they are 12 in this scene, and I believe it's heavily implied it's after the incident. Holding hands could very easily be a sign of comfort, and again, they are 12 and Sunny very obviously has a crush on Aubrey.. . . If it was the other way around, and Sunny and Aubrey were holding hands while it was confirmed Sunny has a crush on Basil? Yeah, my stance would be the same as it is now. It would be Sunny and Aubrey holding hands platonically, and most likely for comfort
Haha sunny. . You loved her and you killed her
But she’s just a nanny/caretaker/opair?. . Anyways tier list from worst to best . Aubrey’s Mom . Sunny’s mom. Basil’s parents . Sunny’s dad. Kel and hero’s parents
What exactly are canonically wrong w Sunny’s parents?
>!The fact that Sunny's dad left after Mari died, even if he knows the truth can generally be seen as a pretty scummy parenting move. As for Sunny's mom, we don't have enough information to know for sure, but the argument can be made for the possibility that she wasn't as attentive to Sunny as she should have been.!<
>!|Sunny's mom left her depressed teenager alone for 3 days with no food but a frozen steak.!<
She also gave him 20 bucks, so that he could order some food. He probably wouldn't even need to go outside, just order it over the phone.. . Being a single parent isn't easy dude.
Implying sunny goes outside or uses the phone. If you have a mentally I’ll child at home who you know hasn’t gone outside in 4 years and presumably not used the phone at that time why would you just leave them at home with 20 dollars under the assumption they’ll get food themself. I’m no way is Sunny’s mom the second worst parent in the entire game and I believe she gets way too much flack and no one said being a single parent was easy but the food situation specifically was dumb.
Sunny’s mom - within the fictional context of the game so far as it goes - probably knows well enough if Sunny is capable of using 20 dollars to order food or not.
Then he would have done it. From the 4 years he’s stayed at home she would know he’s not gonna leave💀
Sunny’s obviously at a bit of a turning point with his depression by the time we meet him in the game. Is it really that hard to believe he’d been capable of calling in a pizza or something before the game’s events and that his mom knew as much?
bruh she let the electricity go out on her teenage son like 💀💀💀
Bro I'm sorry can you order 3 days of food with a 20?
20-30 years ago yes you could
Dad left him and it doesn’t seem (to me at least) that Sunny’s mom cares much about him.
Sunnys dad went to get Milk and his mom left him alone at home for three days knowing damn well he has panic attacks
Sunny’s mom pretended nothing was wrong and left her son alone for three days with only a rotten steak. . . Sunny’s dad just abandoned him after you know what
You're putting way too much reliability on Sunny's POV.. . First off, that steak might not have been rotten, that steak wasn't even microwaved. The power was out that night.. . Second, we can't judge a character purely based off of one time we see them, especially in Black Space of all places.
We keep going over this - the power *isn't* out. The fridge lights are on, the microwave runs, Sunny can use his answering machine, and his computer. The power to the LIGHTS are out. General electricity was not. In plenty of suburban neighborhoods the lights are separate from outlet power.
The power was out, so he couldn't cook the steak... but the power thing was the mom's fault, and she should have realized that he wouldn't be able to prepare the food she left him if there was no power. Besides, even best case scenario in which the power wasn't out, is a steak and 20 dollars enough to hold him over until she got back?
nah, Basil's parents are far worse than Sunny's mom. . . Sunny's mom is at least trying and clearly cares about her son, even if she isn't perfect. She's doing one of the best possible things she could do for Sunny by moving. I mean fuck, the kid literally >!represses the existence of entire rooms of the house. Everything about that house is tied to serious trauma for Sunny at this point, it's best for him to move.!< I get that her >!leaving Sunny, a suicidal kid that barely eats and hasn't been outside in 4 years, alone for 3 days was super irresponsible. She has been unintentionally facilitating Sunny's dangerous coping mechanism as well.!< I never said she was perfect, but she's at the very least trying to help him and clearly cares about him. Considering that every other main characters parents besides kel and hero's are either entirely absent or outright abusive, Sunny's mom is one of the better ones.. . Basil's parents barely even seem to care about him beyond making sure he isn't dead. They've left him with his grandma for his entire life, and don't even bother to visit him ONCE after needing to hire a caretaker for Basil after grandma's condition is too severe to look after him. Let me make this clear, Basil's parents haven't visited their child in two years, when the only parental figure in his life is slowly dying. Basil's friends were the closest thing he ever had to an actual family, because his real family had better things to do than actually take care of him. >!it's no wonder he's the clingy, lonely, self loathing, and suicidal mess he is after hanging Mari and watching his friends all leave him because of what he did.!< God I utterly despise his parents, and they aren't even the worst parents in Omori, Aubrey's mom somehow manages to be worse.
i agree. i was suprised to see sunny's mom before basil's parent's
Hey Sunny’s dad has a perfectly reasonable response to what happened. . Their about even do
I think abandoning your family is a pretty selfish thing to do
>!Mari commits dead (they probably don't know the truth), and instead of being there to help his son get his life together he just leaves. I mean, Sunny's dad would be happier, but still pretty scummy!<
>!”Stay away... You are not my son...” it’s unclear if that quote ever happened or if Sunny imagined it, Blackspace and all, but if it’s a real quote then Sunny’s dad probably knew the truth.!<
That... isn't exactly an answer to the question 
I’d say that Basil’s parents are worse than Sunny’s mom. While she’s not a perfect mother, she is at least trying her best. (?) >!Although she did leave Sunny unsupervised, she did remain in his life, despite possibly knowing the truth. Basil’s parents are never home, which makes them extremely neglectful at best.!<
People have way too little sympathy for Sunny's mom, like the dad is an asshole sure he abandoned his family but that just means Sunny's mom is a single mother trying to provide for her son while dealing with the grief of losing a child.
>!The dad legit leaves sunny and calls him not his son, like he thinks he’s the only one suffering, and leaves his family to crumble, and for the 4 years he never bothered to see what became of sunny!<
My theory is that he suspected that Sunny killed Mari, and extricated himself from the situation because he believed he might harm or kill his own son. Obviously not world's number #1 dad, but considering how bad it could have gotten, leaving may have been his only option.
What about Sunnys mom! She's nice... I believe :)
I am sorry to say it Coffee person. . But no amount of being nice changes the fact that is it generally advised against leaving your shut-in son unsupervised for 3 days. . especially when it's obvious to anyone with eyes that it has to do with tragic loss
I'm not so sure it's fair to say that she absolutely knew the extent and symptoms of Sunny's mental illness. He really tries to keep that bottled up nice and tight.. . Even if she did, what other options did she have? Leave the house completely unattended?
to be fair this game is set in the 1980’s when most people would just let their 7 year old kids roam outside with no supervision. plus, in the early 1980’s mental health was extremely neglected to a point where some people didn’t even know what depression, ptsd, or anxiety even was. with all the factors of this i think that sunnys mom was sorta justified to leave the kid alone
....isn't this set in the 90s tho? I could’ve sworn everyone mutually agreed on the 90s because of the gameboy Sunny has and the fact that Hero is mentioned to be born 199X in the Last Resort (i think)
OK fair. I mean there's no evidence to support she neglects him and it weird she left him.. . I'm not biased but she definitely is just a usual mom I guess. So yeah I guess I agree with the tragic loss on that one
? The lack of supervision in and of itself is considered a [type of neglect.]() Now, that's the law in my state. I don't know what US state Faraway Town is supposed to emulate, but this is the rubric by which I am viewing the situation. Sunny might be older but his circumstances certainly put the question of supervision neglect into question.. . Also, it's worth mentioning, that parents don't always intend for neglect to happen. But that doesn't change that it does happen, separate from their feelings and intentions towards their child.
>!My man... Im pretty sure, she justs wants to get away from sunny as much as possible, most of her phone calls sounds like excuses. And some of the only food she left hin with, is expired stake. There's a reason why sunny looks so close to his younger self(omori) and thats cause he is heavily malnourished. And he fact that he obviously hadnt have any sort of therapy(from what we can see) are some proof i found of child neglect!<
... because they were moving. Duh.. . **Credits roll**. . But seriously. I have no real idea, that was just my own little theory with evidence. But yes, you're correct. . Heres my thoery but its a bit of a stretch >!so sunny's dad might've knew that sunny was the cause of mari's death, maybe. And of course, it wouldnt be farfetched to day he either told the mom, or he himself told her. We also know sunny's mom said something along the lines of "you are my only child left, i dont wanna lose you too". So, maybe the dad suggests that him and the mom should just leave ssunny, but the mom disagree. Which leads to their inevitable divorce. And that causes the mon to go over the edge, but not completely. While she still brings him food, she cant stand to look at him because he lost her to lose 2 of the people she loves. But in contrast, he's the only one left, so she tries to take care of him as much as possible!<. . I know its preety dumb. But im no psychologist
She leaves him raw steak, and he doesn’t know how to cook it properly
>!Hes 16, she leaves notes everywhere, and who else would move the stuff when the dads out of the picture?!<
Correct me of my memory is wrong, because I admit my memory could be wrong and I don't feel like scouring youtube for screenshots but. . >!That's not actually the reason she's away for 3 days straight? If it was one day and she comes back that's fine but I think the reason she gave on the phone was something about a sale...? I don't consider that a good reason to leave my kid alone for 3 days straight, even with notes and answering machine messages. It doesn't take 3 days straight to get the new house ready, does it? Genuinely asking, I have never had to move as an adult before.!<
>!I think the sale thing is right, but she wouldnt be at the store for 3 days lol. If the new house is several hours away, itd be better to just stay for a few days when setting it up!<
Plus leaving a child with raw steak who doesn’t know how to cook it!
who says he doesn't know how to cook it?. . Also it was already cooked and then refrigerated, it wasn't completely raw
He MICROWAVED IT
Well yeah, probably because it was already cooked and it just needed to be reheated
Then why, tell me, did he get so sick from it his vision wobbled?
Idk probably because he ate old reheated steak at 3am
And his mom simply trusted him with it? A 14-16 yo boy
Sunny is 16, and idk about you but when I was 16 I could definitely reheat a steak in the microwave. Even when I was 14 I did that
Nobody's saying she's perfect, but neither are any of the kids. Yet they're given 100x more sympathy than any of the parents.
Dear internet stranger.. . I understand your plight. Really, I do. Being an adult woman/man myself, I get that a lot of people in this fandom don't care to think about the more adult characters more deeply. Seeing as a lot of this fandom are teenagers. Combine that with the fact that we don't really get Sunny's Mom's point of view, makes it really hard to sympathize. I get it.. . But I'm not saying these things maliciously. And that might seem hard to believe from my other comments. But the truth is, I want, more than anything, for someone to write something for the parents. I want them to become multidimensional characters with flaws and mistakes and lessons to learn and part of that is outright saying: "your actions here fucking sucked, especially when you are an adult with a child depending on you". . I feel like the best way to get that is to start with pointing out where the problems are. I'm certain that Sunny's Mom is actually quite a lovely person. Probably quite good company, based on how nice her notes are. But being good company doesn't always mean being a good parent, and that's something I hope she works on in the future with Sunny.. . Does that make any sense? I want drama, I want healing, I want it to come clean and be honest...for example from another franchise, Rosa Ushiromiya and her daughter Maria. That sort of thing, if those two characters mean anything to you.
Aight.
WUAHAHAHAHAHHA CADUCED STEAK
Sunny's mim leave him with everything he needed, he probably could cook the steak, and he is 16, in anyone's mind, he could ask for delivery food. There is no way Sunny's mother knew the amount of depression that was going on, expecially because, considering the way she treats him in the phone calls, he wasn't all that depressed arround her. Also, he clearly loves her and we can see that in the truth segment
nah there’s no way. You don’t let a kid hole himself up in his house, not going to school, for FOUR years and not know that something is horribly wrong. I think she is talking to him like that on the phone because she’s treating him like a twelve year old who hasn’t changed or matured at all. I’m not sure if she knows the truth but it’s implied.
Well, since she knows the truth, she obviously know what's horribly wrong, but Sunny's state was in another level. Heck, I don't think anyone could guess how bad it was except for himself, in the truth segment.. . . Also yeah, she treats him like that, but cut her some slack, sunny is the last thing she has lmao
it just sucks, because she’s the only one who could possibly begin to understand him since she knows what really happened. He either needed some tough love by making him at least leave the house or go to school, and/or some professional help. but instead she lets him just keep existing in a sorry state and lose out on some of the most important years of young adulthood, hence the part where she acts like he’s a kid still. i mean, i sympathize because he is a danger to himself and she doesn’t want to set him off or mess him up worse, but her behavior is not making anything better and ultimately she is still responsible for him
If I might throw something out there, we objectively see no gifts or signs of Sunny’s mom contacting the hospital at the end, despite enough time having gone by that the entire rest of the town was able to pitch in and send get well gifts. While one can argue that they simply didn’t show it because the focus was on Sunny’s group of friends, it doesn’t change the fact that, narratively, we do not see even a mention of his mother visiting after at *least* one or two days at the hospital, during a period where we know she would’ve been there. . . For comparison’s sake, game saw fit to make clear that the random nameless shopkeeper from Fix-It wishes Sunny a good recovery, but omitted his own mother. That can’t be accidental. . . Absence of information can be just as informative as spelling things out, and the omission of Sunny’s mom at the hospital is a pretty damning example of that and tells us everything we need to know about her.
>You're putting way too much reliability on Sunny's POV.. . Sunny's POV is the primary view through which the story is told, we have no choice but to rely on it. If we just say that Sunny is unreliable full stop then we have no way of knowing for sure if anything we see from his POV is accurate or not. The only time we shouldn't trust Sunny is if something in the real world directly contradicts something in headspace. (for example: Kel likes milk in headspace but says he hates it in the real world). . >First off, that steak might not have been rotten, that steak wasn't even microwaved. The power was out that night.. . It was microwaved. Only the lights were out, not all the power
It doesn’t matter how we view it, we saw how sunny viewed his dad, which showed how he left him affected sunny, it doesn’t matter how we view how sunny views, because it affected sunny badly
I think he's jokingly trying to suggest you repressed it like Sunny
I know bruh, I'm just to boring to join this type of joke, I don't tolerate people doing this.
doing what exactly
This joke!
>!Neither does Sunny anymore!<
he said.   . >never had.   . . so it won't work
I somewhat relate to it, but not a kind where >!"I killed somebody by pushing them down the stairs"!<  but the kind where I have this bubble of isolation a small circle of safe zone which I rather spend time in that than facing reality.   . Again it’s not as severe as Sunny, but the feeling he feel are sometimes familiar.
Through a bizzare blend of mental issues, my brand of maladaptive daydreaming is involuntary, like it's my default state. Focusing on anything at all requires a monumental amount of effort, including things I've managed to hyperfixate on. It's analogous to holding your breath, do it too much and you'll shut down as your body takes over. Being able to relate to sunny made the game's plot hit me... *really* hard, especially with my sensitivity to suffering, guilt, and losing the things you love, and it taught me a lot of things about myself. After 6 straight months of crying at least once a day, anything Omori related has taken up permanent residence in my eternal daydreams.
This.. . I accidentally mentioned I found Sunny relatable to Omocat herself (she asked who my favorite character was) and we joked about it when I was like 'well not THAT part', and she was like 'Yeah I was going to say 'are you sure about that' and we laughed. And then I realized I probably would have sounded more normal if I said like, Space Boyfriend or something.. . But I am very unwell a lot of the time so I live in isolation and escapism, with other certain destructive habits, and guilt. I mean >!I didn't kill anyone obviously !< but yeah, besides that... I am basically a hikkikomori, lol.
🧢
Yeah this is something I relate to a lot! I isolate myself constantly and I daydream a lot. As you said, too, it's not as bad as Sunny, but it's still very relatable
those who relate to omori don't relate to it literally, depression is a pretty widespread issue in modern society so many people will (figurativly) find themselves in the game and really resonate with Sunny's problems
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|surprise) —>. . HE’S LITERALLY ME
he borgor
he jus like me fr!! 
This right here— its not the *literal* situation people relate to. People relate to the overall themes like depression/anxiety, grief, isolation, etc. . . For instance, one if the reasons OMORI was bittersweet for me was because it so successfully portrays how surreal/alienating it is to come out if isolation and see that everyone and everything has changed around you, while you stayed the same.
👆
i relate to the childhood guilt
...do I want to know what it's about?
no
I do
Yeah, that's pretty much the reason I can relate.
I uh- I kind of can. I accidentally made my mum >!fall down the stairs (she tripped over my bag when she was running down & I didn’t have enough time to move it before she got to it)!<. She’s okay. It was New Year 2019-2020. She broke her foot & had to get surgery, she has a metal plate now, but she doesn’t blame me, she did in the moment but the day after it happened after she calmed down she realised it was partially also her fault for running & not giving me a chance to move my bag. I can confirm that like >!Sunny, the situation is scary & you panic. Rational thinking goes away lol I just ran upstairs & cried for an hour, I had no incentive to think “I should check she’s okay” or “someone call 999”,!< it was just fight or flight. Obviously my situation is significantly less bad, but it was a horrible situation none the less & I do understand why >!Sunny & Basil!< acted the way they did in the scene. I was 15 at the time btw, so I was even older than they were 😅
Did that impact you while you played omori the first time? It’s not as bad, sure, but I bet it’s still a very unpleasant memory
It did a bit, yeah. I feel guilty whenever I watch that scene & intrusive thoughts aren’t very good in combination with that. It’s definitely the most guilty memory I have as well. 😅
I’m actually a little shocked this is the only commenter who has made someone fall down the stairs. It sounds quite scary though, sorry :((
I relate to Sunny wanting to stay in his dreams and not face reality
I relate to Sunny a bit cus of the whole imagining epic adventures with a non-existent group of friends.   . Oh...also, my sister is learning to play the piano...and she has >!a black cat...and I live in a two story house!<
please >!do not get in an argument at the top of the stairs with her!<
Too late, but >!we both are alive !<
Change that
I mean you can find Omori relatable. I found several parts of Sunny's personality kinda relatabke. Especially Sunny's want to just not have feelings. Several other things are kinda relatable as well, not as a whole, but enough bits and pecies to make it feel relatable.
I deal with depression and maladaptive daydreaming so I find it relatable on those aspects. Also the >! Final fight against Omori and he starts telling Sunny all those horrible things !< Though, no, I’m not dealing with >! The guilt of killing my sister !< I still find the imagery in the game relatable. The Something’s and “something behind you” is how I’ve always imagined my mental illness and intrusive thoughts. Playing Omori and the imagery within it was like watching my own mental health through a looking glass and made me realize that I… really need therapy 
i relate to sunny in pretty much everything (when i first played the game at least), minus the >!murder!< and the going outside to talk to people and get jobs
Except for the incident it’s very relatable to me, that’s why it hits so hard. Main difference being I never had a good childhood or true friends like sunny did, although I wish that were the case.
playing omori i was so shocked at how much i relate to sunny :,) >!but hey, at least i haven’t killed anyone yet!<
I think the story itself is not relatable because it's kind of a specific situation but I think the way the characters specially Sunny deal with the situation is kind of relatable ( for me tbh ). The way sunny isolated himself from the whole world after that situation until the guilt "decorated" him inside is something I do
i found Omori relatable in mid-2021 like i just spiralled into depression EVEN deeper because i did something very horrible to someone i love so much like Sunny. i guess i learned it the hard way, but when i got a job it got better then bad again because of my monster of a boss asking me to help him do something similar 🤢 like dude's asking a young woman to help him do something bad wth. i would never go back there. also if you guys want more details just ask because I'll probably comment it here
im addicted to omori because i relate to sunny lmao
Relating to the game is bad somehow. . I relate to Sunny somewhat and have a few disorders so uhhh
well depression, dissociation, childhood trauma moment. its why snuuy is the best
Sunny relatable
sunny looks suspiciously like me
I relate to Sunny in that I havent left my house outside of my backyard in some time (since 3 months ago i think) but my reason is different. I don't leave due to intense bullying that gave me some pretty bad anxiety. The bullying became sexual harassment and people using my sensory issues against me and basically forcing me into meltdowns.
I find some things kinda relatable. But, like, most of that is b/c I've got depression and use escapism/avoidance to cope with lit anything. (It is... a work in progress, heh). . So I feel like I get some of Sunny’s struggles, even if I don’t personally have it as bad. It makes me wanna keep an eye out for him! But he's not real, obv, so I'm kinda using it as a precautionary tale instead.
I find omori relateable mostly because of how sunny processes trauma, it's the same way I processed mine, making up a fake world and isolating myself, even the way intrusive thoughts were protrayed.. . Some may find it weird to relate to this game in that way but it was the first time I had ever seen a character cope with their trauma the same way that I did, it has really made me feel less alone.
i kin sunny 
\*insert sunny AND omori kinnie moment here\* 
I mean I think Sunny’s pretty relatable on a basis of intense mental illness making it difficult to leave/go places and unrepentable ~trauma~ lmfao. And if you make it to my age (I’ll be 30 in 3 years) without one or the other following you around I’m genuinely surprised.
>!Sadly I heavily relate to sunny!<
The fact that Sunny had to move on without his friend hit close to home, I spent one year in a game design school with a routine I liked in a town I liked, but I had to quit despite loving it
I relate to sunny wanting to go back to the good old days of childhood 😭
nah sunny has a crush on her i’m pretty sure he would be happy and not block her 
Sunny just like me fr
I want to know what Sunny's response is
sunny x basil ?-or sunny x aubrey ?you guys  choose
Sunny’s expression is amazing
Snuuy the cat
Pet the Snuuy 
 Does Snuuy want a binky?. .  (👉 STAB)
 OWW WHAT THE-. .  \>:c
Sunny has to go to time out>:[
When I was little my mom didn't really care when I stabbed my friends
#WHAT
What? Are you telling me you didn't go a violent murder sprees as a toddler?
No not really
Kids these days... no one wants to kill people anymore... 
...what did you do?!
Read the newspaper tomorrow
#WHAT
Ah the memories
Only in your dreams Sunny 
sunny was a switch
Sunny being a gaming console that’s portable and comes from Nintendo and has multiple games on it, well I won’t stand for that
I love playing kirby and the forgotten land on my sunny

made a joke about Sunny being a switch
Just me or does Sunny look scared
He does
Role swap, also Sunny’s the terrified lol
Sunny doesn't look okay in the second pic
Omori when he doesn't get held  Sunny on the other hand
omori looks like he does that every time. . Sunny looks like he was scared and jumped into the gross vegetal
GROSS vegetal?!?!? 
Vegetal... Vegeta U MADE A VEGETA REFERENCE. . . . U have summoned him....
God I wish I was snuuy
Average omori fan wishing to get some bitches(they don't know the game made them all gay) /jk
:Damn Sunny, I didn’t know you were into being the bot-. . : **SHUT**
I'm pretty sure this is the vine that everyone thinks of when they see Sunny or Omori.
Yeah... Sure.... . ^(ayo)
good bot
best bot
love
As I already mentioned in a different reply. And guess what, the skill can only be used in the recycultist dungeon (you know, the imaginary world where Sunny and the gang murder people), and it is in fact an instant kill move. Meaning the danger of the bat is not underestimated
(sunny can tank it with persist do)
Not the biggest Aubrey fan, but she never uses the bat in-game, just in the cultists section, and that was Sunny's dream, so yeah. She readies it before a fight then her sprite shows her just having it on her back, and if that wasn't enough the battle log explicitly says she kicks, punches and stuff like that, never something like "Aubrey hit Sunny with her bat", not once on Kel or Sunny. As I said, I know Aubrey did awful stuff (not as bad as  tho) but you have to be fair on the fact she never uses it, at least on her friends, so it could be just intimidation, it could be that deep down inside she still cares about Kel and Sunny and doesn't want to open their skulls lol. . And then you have Sunny with the steak knife doing a little trolling 
Fr though like mfs she attacked us **first** and Sunny didn't even hurt her enough for it needing medical aid or something smh
Yep. I don't blame Sunny for bringing a knife man 
The Recycultists are Sunny's daydream though
Yeah sorry bad memory.
This has got to be my favorite piece of Omori fanart. The feeling when someone holds up a knife to you, let alone a childhood friend, is fucking *terrifying.*. . Aubrey saying to Kel “at least I don’t hang out with a psychopath who carries a knife around” was one of the most impactful moments in the game for me, maybe because someone was *finally* acknowledging that Sunny is far from normal. Idk it made him a lot scarier in my eyes, even if he was just a broken kid– again, threatening someone with a knife? Yikes. . Edit; And more relating to this fanart, the artist really captured the shock and horror in everyone’s faces. Great choice to not show Sunny’s face, I think it all works really well together
>Aubrey saying to Kel “at least I don’t hang out with a psychopath who carries a knife around” was one of the most impactful moments in the game for me, maybe because someone was finally acknowledging that Sunny is far from normal. Idk it made him a lot scarier in my eyes, even if he was just a broken kid– again, threatening someone with a knife? Yikes. . I think the impact is lessened a bit for me because she's one to talk... since she carries a nail bat around.
Copium, also known as reading comprehension. The game at multiple points acknowledges the direct danger of the bat (the comment in the menu Sunny has on it being more dangerous than the knife, the fact that she has a skill where she uses it and it can literally instantly kill someone), so the fact that no comment is ever made on her hitting people with it, but a comment is made when Sunny cuts her, makes it blindingly obvious she's not using it on anyone and that they just reused assets since they're tied to Aubrey. . . Now, if Sunny were in his right mind, I'd say it's just fine that he used the knife to defend himself from someone who had a bat (even if Kel didn't seem concerned with it, presumably because she hasn't used it on anyone else either). But he's not carrying the knife around for self-defense. He's carrying it around because he's barely cognizant of reality and is behaving as if he were Omori in Headspace, where murdering things with knives is just how things go. All the fights with the hooligans end with everyone at worst like, mildly scuffed up, so presumably they aren't especially intense, so someone actually using a weapon on someone is concerning. If he weren't a malnourished shut-in who probably weighs less soaking wet than Kel does normally, someone might've gotten seriously hurt.
: I didn't mean to harm her like that. I simply wasn't in the right state of mind.. . : It was in self-defense, and I-. . : I didn't mean to.... . : .... . : Come on, Sunny. We should go before this gets any worse.
(aubrey would hit snuuy over the head with her bat 5 times)
 (Sunny is unconscious.). . (What will Kel do?)
: IM GONNA DO THE SAME THING TO YOU, YOU BITC-. . (aubrey would knock him over the head with her bat 5 times like she did to sunny)
: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry... I heard what happened, and I.... . : .... . : The truth is that I attacked Sunny and Kel out of self-defense. Sunny pulled out a knife on me, and I reacted poorly.. . : .... . : I'm going to go now.. . (Aubrey ran away.). . (Hero walks over to his mom's car, and drives to the hospital.)
(meanwhile). . : sunny, are you okay!?. . : yea, im fine
: Oh, well, that's good! What should we do now, Sunny?
SUNNY WAS THE IMPOSTOR. . . 1 IMPOSTOR REMAINING
 Sunny’s got a knife!. .  You got a nail bat!. .  That was only for intimidation!. .  You seem pretty intimidated by my knife, so I can say the same thing.
sunny's like: you fucked up for THE LAST TIME.
I got into this game completely on accident and it’s one of the games that I’ve found myself actually having physical reactions to my emotions towards this game. Little details that are dropped in sentences seem to never fail in amazing me when they are utilized later.  One of my favorite pieces is when >!Aubrey talks about basil and Sunny’s withdrawal from everything after Mari’s death. Then the reveal came and it shocked me. (I haven’t completed the game, I still have about 2-3 hours to go. Stuck on the OMORI VS SUNNY fight 😂)!< regardless, the game has a lot of content and it takes a good Chuck of time. Since I’ve been spending more time playing it than I’d like to admit, I haven’t gotten a chance to take a look into this fandom fully, but just from what I’ve seen on other social medias, it’s strange seeing how they treat characters. . . Anyways, Mr. Jawsum for the win
\*Sunny
Honestly, one could argue that it was OMORI or SOMETHING working through Sunny that led him to blackout the photos... with how it comes up on the beach in Headspace it seems like it was almost an involuntary thing . . ...Just some musings lol
>!Nah omori was intentional, in one route where you take back the memory book but hold onto it, you wake up to find all the pictures scribbled out anyway, sunny never conciously does it!<
Omori didn't existed back when he did that 1st time
I thought they did, since omori was formed shortly after the issue which was around the same time the incident with the photos happened, since it also lines up with how sunny copes with stuff (with how he suppresses everything to the point of removing doors from his perception of reality)
I'm inclined to think it was the formative stages of what omori was to become, before sunny "forgot himself"
I think it was made pretty clear that OMORI and SUNNY are one in the same. OMORI is the reaction of grief and guilt to >!Maris death!< which is shown through >!The battle between SUNNY and OMORI where he is consistently blamed and made to feel like it’s his own fault!< I believe OMORI is the personification of SUNNYS guilt and grief. That is the reason you unlock “overcome”.
Putting yourself in Sunny's shoes is literally the worst way to look at it
It's a sunny character study, that's what headspace is, we got to know his friends from his perspective lmao. Figuring out what sunny is thinking is a big part of the game that is hidden by his role as a silent protag, also it is annoying that if sunny leaves, basil dies. Canon sunny likes basil enough as evidenced by their childhood memories and dynamic, however, the game makes it palpable how unsettling it is at the end of the day, who's perspective should I look through? Basil is annoying so not them
Ackshually, Sunny's not a silent protag, >!in the good ending, he says "guys I have something to tell you"!< so that means he does actually speak in the game and thus isn't silent ☝️🤓
>i get the game is long and padded but i can't count how many times i've seen people viciously debate like their life depends on it over an argument that is obliterated by a blatant detail in the canon game they were somehow entirely unaware of up until that point.. . >half of the time people subconsciously argue over fanon, surface-level versions of the characters they got overly attached to their headcanons of instead of the actual characters in the game;. . . . "Aubrey is abused by her mother". . "Kel is in the wrong for confronting Aubrey". . "Basil is obsessed with Sunny". . "Kel is secretly depressed". . "Sunny is evil". . "Aubrey was right in doing what she did". . "Kel has been the only one knocking on Sunny's door for 4 years". . "Basil wanted to kill both Sunny and himself". . "Sunny's Dad is an asshole". . "Sunny's parents knew the truth". . "The entirety of the Omori AO3 community". . >!"Mari was alive when they hanged her"!<. . "Sunny is controlled by Omori"
Some of these are pretty possible tbh
Well, sunny's dad abandon his depressed child and wife, kinda of a asshole If you ask me
His mother isn't a saint either for not even visiting Sunny, or maybe it's just that when the game takes place she was outside doing the paperwork to move
Keep in mind that that scene takes place in Sunny's mind. We don't know if this is an actual memory or just Sunny's way of blaming himself for his dad leaving
There's a lot of subtext in the game, but I've noticed some people play games when making their points. For a recent example, whether or not Sunny left his house after everything that happened.. . We have a character saying he hasn't left his house in years. No other character denies that statement.  Cris, who came back shortly after Mari's death [three years before the game's events], acted as if she hadn't seen Sunny in years. . . And yet, since we can't definitively prove that Sunny never left his house, there is just a small chance that he did leave his house. Despite statements from multiple characters saying and acting as such.
wow this is great writing. Could you convince me that Sunny cant be seen as purely evil even in the true ending? From my POV, theres an argument to be made that Sunny just kind of only cared about himself to the end, and his character arc was him learning to love himself when in reality he should have learned to truly love others.
appreciate the compliment!! not sure but i'll try my best to summarize to my knowledge (focusing on the route up to true ending) good typing practice since i find this is an interesting take lmao. . i don't like the idea of "pure evil" as a moral concept in regards to this game but i'll still try at a (spoiler heavy) counterargument.. . .. . comically short summary: . . as daddy longlegs said: "how does one define malice without intent?". sunny in reality is consistently portrayed as having never carried ill will in his actions so by that logic he can't be evil.. . .. . comically long summary:. . there's an argument for omori being an "evil" character in a certain way but >!omori and sunny and entirely separate entities. !<. . sunny is, at his core, a depressed and traumatized child who's immediate coping response was to try and mentally prolong >!the time he and his friend group happily spent together when mari was still in it..!<. . the day that sunny leaves his house in his route and reconnects with kel is, in a sense, him leaving the house as the same emotionally and developmentally immature 12 year old boy he was the day he started isolating himself in it. sunny is forced to both unlearn 4 years worth of life in a lonely, false reality in the span of 3 days and also come to terms with what he lost and caused in the same timeframe too (>!which ofc to such a mentally stunted kid is going to be jarring and overwhelming. !<). . his mind's only learnt defense against negative emotions and trauma is to block out the stimuli causing it, and since sunny as a kid was stoic and kept his issues (>!like getting frustrated with playing the violin!<) to himself >!until he snapped (recital day)!< he never established any reliable sources of emotional support besides.. mari. >!and even on recital day; if you check the truth album's text in the game files, he only pushed mari after she frustratedly tried to block his path so he couldn't escape, meaning the push!< most likely wasn't out of impulsive anger but instead desperation to escape the situation, same method his brain only knew to retreat back to throughout everything that happened afterwards as a result. . . the days after >!mari's death!< sunny resists basils attempts at >!helping him remember their memories with the photo album to come to terms with what was lost and later scribbles out the photos and isolated himself; none really implied as malicious acts of spite against basil and the rest of his friends but as a mentally distressed response for sunny trying to mask the pain of remembering what's gone and the self-loathing of being responsible for it.!< it's not that he chose to ignore his mistakes; he psychologically could not bear living on knowing what he did that his mind had to desperately block all of that trauma out from ever disturbing him, without choice.. . that further developing mental response to the trauma then manifests as >!omori (sunny's mind disassociating from who he even was as a person because of the guilt), who *is* described in deeper well as an "evil form" in the sense that it's sunny's uncontrollable, maladaptive coping mechanism and not a representation true to sunny or his wishes. omori is uncontrollable as the creator of headspace because he is literally sunny's constant depression+repression personified. !< despite this, the constant headspace fog and self-questioning: (>! "do you **want** to high-five kel", "do you **want** to save basil", "do you **want** to pick up this photo", "do you **want** to open the door"!<) show that despite his stubborn coping response, sunny--in opposition--does still have a will to ease into making social gestures and personal decisions that threaten the repressive escapism he's emotionally relied on. he always loved his friends; he just struggled to mentally bear the reality of >!mari's loss!< and his guilt for what it caused. along with that, all the confusion and conflict stemming from >!mari's supposed suicide!< was entirely a result of sunny's coping response and not a decision he could have consciously maintained (>!somewhat supported by omori killing truth basil in blackspace regardless of whether or not player wants to save him when prompted!<);. .  >!the final fight with omori!<--where he overcomes his maladaptive repression to finally remember both the good and bad memories he made--is symbolic of him breaking out of that harmful cycle so that he can mend his bond to the people that his real friends have become instead of to his self-protective childhood fantasy of who he wishes they could all still be, risking the consequences of him sacrificing the blissful ignorance he relied on to survive until that point so that his friends could finally have enlightening closure regarding what tore their friendship apart in the first place and properly heal from it.. . lengthy read (>!i've never tried to question his morality so thoroughly until now!<) but the counterargument i'm trying to make with this is that sunny isn't "evil" because *almost all* of his harmful actions after the beginning of the game are >!perpetuated by omori; his subconscious internal repression that he doesn't even fully understand!< rather than himself. when real world progress is made, when sunny discovers the truth, when the storyline develops in a positive direction and the final fight starts, it's never carried out as omori but as sunny, even if it's still somewhere in his mind. sunny is always the one making the gradual effort to improve himself for the wellbeing of his friends >!whereas omori is the one trying to actively stall and prevent that positive change!<. even shortly before moving there's really no reason for him to even have left his house again for his friends if he wasn't concerned about them anymore. which imo is evidence.
"attempted murder of sunny" bae they were literally both trying to kill each other (each others "Something"s)
>I didn't really see Basil as the scapegoat. . It's within meta-context. Basil is used as a scapegoat in order to victimize Sunny.. . Speaking from personal experience, the majority of Basil-hate is somehow related to Sunny.. . Sunny this, Sunny that, wah wah poor Sunny.. . The other 3 are rarely brought up, and even then it is more of a sidenote.. . >!Sunny is treated like he is a genuine victim even though he is the primary culprit.!<. . &#x200B;. . >>! attempted murder of Sunny!<. . Context of this is a >!psychotic break. Basil meant to attack 'Something', not Sunny.!<. . This is a general thing.

And Sunny still has Head Space. While it's not perfect, it's a whole lot better than nothing.. . Basil doesn't have that luxury. Hell, he has full-on psychotic breakdowns on a regular basis.. . I do not recall Sunny suffering from that.. . &#x200B;. . > I do agree tho that it's bad to be oversimplified as either the stereotypical evil character or the gay flower boy since there is plenty of nuance in his character. I just think the hate that he receives is somewhat justified. . . The problem isn't the hate existing in general.. . The problem is the sheer hypocrisy and bias that come with it.. . Sunny is arguably worse, yet no noteworthy amount of hatred towards him exists.. . The reason for this is blatant bias. People generally like him and will go out of their way to present him in the most positive light possible. This includes baselesly assuming things and ignoring even the most obvious negative implications.. . Prime example are the >!scrapped captions of the BSA.!<. . >!They point at dissociation and pretend that this somehow means Sunny has nothing to do with the cover-up, even though his state did neither prevent him from realizing that it was a horrible thing to do nor did it stop him from feeling relieve at the prospect of escaping the blame.!<. . >!The worst thing is that, according to the captions, Maris death wasn't even an accident.!<. . >>! Photo of Panic!<  . >  . >>!It happened in an instant. You didn't mean to do that. Well, you did mean to push her, didn't you? It was an accident, right? You're not sure. You tremble your way down the staircase. !<. . >!It's openly stated that he meant to push her.!<. . >>! Photo of Guilt!<  . >  . >>!You want to scream for help, but you're afraid... you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? There's no way you can tell them the truth. Who would be able to forgive him? Who would believe... that it was... an accident? !<. . >!Look, 'm sorry, but I don't know how else I am supposed to frame this:!<. . >!Sunny made a concious decision not to call for help. The reason being a fear of consequences. This is NOT okay.!<. . >!He literally prioritizes himself over Maris literal life.!<
>>!Sunny made a concious decision not to call for help. The reason being a fear of consequences. This is NOT okay.!<  . >  . >>!He literally prioritizes himself over Maris literal life.!<. . >!Fair. Sunny's actions to not call for help immediately is definitely wrong.  Despite this, if Basil was straight up not there to hang Mari, I think it's still unknown what he would ultimately do. I think it's still possible that he ends up just telling the truth, but it's also possible that he just finds another way to fake it. It certainly wouldn't just resolve the issue, but it would make the possibility of a better ending more likely where he actually calls for help.!<. . >>!They point at dissociation and pretend that this somehow means Sunny has nothing to do with the cover-up, even though his state did neither prevent him from realizing that it was a horrible thing to do nor did it stop him from feeling relieve at the prospect of escaping the blame.!<. . >!I agree that he was involved with the coverup in the sense that he was a bystander that could have stopped the situation but he didn't directly help with the cover up assuming that the captions are right and he just "stared at leaves" the whole time.

It's still really fd up that he did it but not to the same degree of actually trying to kill Sunny even if it is a psychotic break. The argument could be made that Basil didn't really see a literal something but was using the arbitrary concept of "something else killed Mari" to justify intentionally killing Sunny because he would be killing "something" instead of Sunny. He could also have been saying "something behind you" in order to lure Sunny into looking the other way so that he could kill him.

It's definitely hard to gauge how much each character suffers since a lot of the details are missing and kind of assumed from how they live in the present.

I have never seen anybody say 'Basil did nothing wrong', or anything similar though.. . And it's not like the original post is implying that, either.. . Sunny, on the other hand, gets absolutely whitewashed, or even victimized.. . If there is any character this message should be adressed to, it's Sunny.
The descriptions are consistently from Sunnys perspective, yet you suggest a random shift in POV for no appearant reason.. . Like, look, Basil doesn't even know it was Sunny to begin with:. . >***When something killed MARI...***  . >  . >*When something ruined all my photos...*  . >  . >*I didn't say anything...*  . >  . >*I didn't want people to think it was you, SUNNY.*  . >  . >*SUNNY... SUNNY wouldn't... do something like that.*. . *Sunny* says it was an accident. . . Meanwhile *Basil* fails to comprehend that it was Sunnys fault to begin with, not even as an accident.
> yet you suggest a random shift in POV for no appearant reason.. . Why else would the text refer to Sunny as "him"?. . > Like, look, Basil doesn't even know it was Sunny to begin with:. . Very debatable. It is very plausible he is just in denial.
>Why else would the text refer to Sunny as "him"?. . Because it is Reported Speech:. . >  you mumble to yourself... . . The narrator reports something Sunny mumbled to himself.. . Within reported speech there is a shift in pronouns. First-person-pronouns are changed to third-person-pronouns.. . Here's for better understanding:. . Direct speech: '*Who would be able to forgive me?'*. . Reported Speech: Who would be able to forgive him?. . It can't be direct speech, since in that case it would have quotation marks.. . &#x200B;. . Now granted, the sentence would still look the same even if it was Basils POV, but in context of the other descriptions consistently relaying Sunnys perspective, it's safe to assume that this one is Sunnys POV, too.. . &#x200B;. .  . . >Very debatable. It is very plausible he is just in denial.. . I don't see how. All evidence points to what I said, and nothing to this conclusion.. . You have to take authorial intent into consideration when OMOCAT puts lines such as this into the game.
>Why isn't it changed to "Who would be able to forgive you?". . Because it'd be unclear wether this is an internal train-of-thought or something that has been said out loud.. . The change in pronoums signifies that this is not an internal thought, but something the character in question - Sunny - said out loud.. . >We don't know what Omocat's intent was. All we have is a few lines that read to me like he is in denial and knows deep down that Sunny did it.. . No offense, but I honestly do not get at all how you reach that conclusion.. . Could you explain why think this?
> Because it'd be unclear wether this is an internal train-of-thought or something that has been said out loud.. > . > . > . > The change in pronoums signifies that this is not an internal thought, but something the character in question - Sunny - said out loud.. . No it doesn't. It doesn't do that at all. I don't see why you think it does.. . > Could you explain why think this?. . Because his dialogue on the matter reads very much as if he's trying to convince himself.. . Also it really damages the themes of the game if Basil is insane and doesn't know what's real and what's not.
Sunny and Stan Marsh somehow generate virtually the exact same discourse, down to what people think of their friends and family in relation to them
They even both do the character design thing where they have 2 strands of hair sticking out.
IMO, he is just a sweet and sensitive kid who was thrown into a traumatic situation and handled it poorly. >!He believes the murder was accidental and wants to help Sunny hide it to save his friend from the consequences.!<. . Whether this makes him innocent or not, I'm not sure where I stand.  I guess not? But he's not evil or even a bad person from my perspective.
I disagree, he probably saved sunny's entire future.
By committing a crime.
The law is rarely justice.
I call bullshit, he might have saved Sunny's future, but in doing that he hid evidence of a murder. Not innocent.
Because sunny would go to fucking jail?
He was 12
Juvenile detention.
i played through the sunny route and cried like a little baby thank you very much 
POV youre reacting to my “Sunny is kind of evil throughout most of Omori” take
Yeah, someone on this thread already did it
I have played the sunny route and Omori route and gameplay wise I liked omori route more but feelings wise it has got to be the sunny route
what did sunnys dad do
No one knows 😳
NO ONE CARES ABOUT A SINGLE VIOLIN
Well there is evidance pointing towards sunnys dad disowning him after he found out he  >!killed mari!<
oh my god thats awful
need an edit of sunny inside of the bronco
sunnys mom:you know I miss mari a lot.    . sunny:mom why are we going 150k\s

sunny's mom is just fucking sending it
as if sunny wasn't miserable enough
Not for long!
we must continue pushing fowards or in this case backwards. . Sunny survives the crash with minor injuries but his mother slowly dies right in front of his eyes
Imagine leaving the hospital and getting sent straight back an hour later
Not to mention we dont know if Sunny has insurance, if he doesnt we get blackspace 3
sunny's mom Irl [
Sunny: ?!. . Sunny’s mom: You aren’t the only one who’s a bit suicidal sweetie.
Further proof sunny has shitty parents
Plot twist: it's actually a small plane and Sunny's mom is just flying it really low
Even if the car crashes, Sunny can survive by just breathing.
So either faraway town (or whatever it was called it’s been a while since i played it) is actually in the dead center of los angeles and it just looks really suburban or sunny’s mom is a fucking maniac.
Good bot
Sunny be getting driven around in a GT3
Sunny dies!. *Throws confetti*
ok but why is sunny's chair rotated 180° or am i losing something like there's no any window in front of him
sunny: "ok"

So the story repeats . Sunny pushes everyone
>!bad ending is when sunny fucks up the generator too!<
What if he never has anything to complain about because he's always already told it to Sunny or is forcing it out with toxic positivity
I don't remember why, all I know is Sunflower is Sunny x Basil, Suntan is Sunny x Kel, and Sunburn is Sunny x Aubrey
Sunny is like "don't blame me".
Sunny seems to be enjoying himself.
Surprised that he would end up in a mental-status similar to Sunny.
There won't even be one. As he is Sunny's guardian angel.
 200 hundred Sunny. You gotta pay attention cuz I WILL be quizzing you all on this later.

(If you think its AI, it isn't, I'm a ibis paint user and I use a lot effects, most of the time being for the colors, and I have the speed paint of it, as a artist that is way too proud I would never steal art, that is for lazy people)
yesssss i named my dog after sunny!!!!
Brother I have sunny tattooed on to me I’m locked in for real twin
Survivor of depression and suicidal ideation. Escapism and friends were my main method of running from it. . . You’ve probably an idea of why Sunny is my favorite.
I held Sunny hostage at one point.
I was depressed and experiencing suicidal ideation for the first time when I started playing Omori.  Depression followed me into the game, and lingered after I finished it.  Thankfully I had therapy (and lots of Omori fan content) to help me through the tough times.  The game resonated very strongly with me because I could see myself in Sunny through the way he acts in the game and the way he talks to himself
>!But Something is there!!<. . >!Something: "Sunny, I love you"!<
Nah, its teabagging Sunny (also petition to add Something's sticker)
Hey there, would you like to sign my petition?
What is your petition about?
“Sign my petition or I’ll follow you home and kill your dog”
“No way you freaking pinko!”
"Are you gonna sign this petition, or will it be your remaining family members?"
Don’t worry Sunny! Everything will be okay! 
I think
Probably
Maybe
Perhaps
Idk man, last time somebody said that, everything was indeed not okay
Sunny I'm here, I love you
*Sad Sunny cosplayer noises*
Sunny in his 4 years of isolation. . 
SUNNY NO-
: its alright sunny, sometimes things might not go as planned and its okay, we can do it again alright? I will help you and the sushi is going to be really good.
Me too Sunny, me too
certified sunny moment
Sunnyyyy :(
Why is Sunny so relatable?!
Oh no Sunny-
He tried so hard and got so but in the end he failed.
/r/meirl big time.. . Honestly Sunny is just /r/meirl unfortunately.
Sunny has become stressed out
Snuuy just like me fr
Then sunny made omori so he becomes Omori Juana.
He’s currently fighting his inner demons
(omori did not succumb)
If Sunny ends up having no pupils it means Omori won
Sunny "No, I will never become Sans Undertale!". . >!Omori: "hehehehehehehehehehe"!<
Hornet: *depression*
It looks like his nose is twitching slightly too
Sunny got sick
bro istg they're doing literally everything with black eyes sans (like hornet, hollow night, and one piece)
it’s all becoming sans
Wait, it was sans all along?
\*loads gun\* it always has been
Meanwhile the actual sans keeps on getting his eyes every color but blue
IKR
Ah yes, that one Nintendo Switch left eye
I can just hear caramelldansen playing from inside his head
Argore alternating between orange/blue attacks be like:
\*Asgore
Sunny shouldn't have eaten that steak
Now I know how the one piece fans feel with the jolly roger
as a one piece fan, I've given up
Sunny eating the steak, becoming sans, and having a seizure
Sunny has disco eyes now I guess
Its been like that for 24 hrs 
Where is this I can't find it
~1770 1520
Thanks found it
Sunny ate the mushrooms in his back garden to see the white space again
Dude I've been trying to fix this shit for like half an hour now
and his nose too
Holy shit im one of the white ones!
I’m that one cyan one Lmfao
Damn u made sunny turn into sans
Worth it
sansunny
Guys we need to save the void
r/place is becoming white space
I fixed his eyes from being red 🤝
Frankly I'm just glad you guys finally decided to give him the white dots.. . Having the >!good end title screen!< but not the >!good end Sunny sprite!< was lowkey bothering me.
headspace trying to escape from sunnys head
This literally all started because I as an individual placed a single pupil on his left eye
Sunny has those Lord English eyes
he is already here
Hallucinations
omg sans
i was fixing that all of yesterday
I posted it in chat.
Cool how the flag is moving far left
reminds me of rolling girl, unsurprisingly.

Sounds like spoilers.
Tbh I think that’s too physically forwards for Sunny…. . I’m nitpicking, this is great, love the style and interactions

Kel the hero saving poor Sunny from the evil suplex demon
Poor Snuuy.... . >!also he has the eye, put a spoiler tag...!<
Her tie's oversized.
"i hate me too aubrey". . "haha, good one sunny". . "....". . "that WAS an april fools joke... right?". . "...."
"Same sunny, same"- hero walking into the room
Nah based Hero would have forgiven sunny already
the expression on poor sunny's face after being suplexed 😂
The true expression of heartbreak
probably head or neck break too 😂
Poor sunny >!got sent back to the hospital!<
Sunny being romantic 
I just hope they weren't doing the secret dance 💀
I don't know if professional wrestling is that much of a secret...or a dance...
They weren't doing pro wrestling 💀
Amateur Wrestling?
There's no wrestling involved, its something that your young mind must not know.
Nah it's definitely wrestling
Sunny’s lucky he still has a working eye or else he couldn’t see Aubrey, the time is now.
Need more of these 
THIS IS SO CUTEEEEEE

the face sun's doing at the end... *yes*
true
uhm...tbh i dunno if Aubrey suplex Sunny to prevent Kel from finding them like that, or if it really was part of a prank 
>!Oh wait I just realized why his eye is white!<
Its a glass eye
Aubrey suplexes sunny, because she can.

Super cute comic. But we all know Sunny got zero rizz
He’s got that unspoken rizz though. 
deserved
Your art, explendid
Man, sunny with his dead eye is just so damn cool.
Sunny got vampire skin.
omori doesn't want sunny to go to school
oh cute
Hikikomori energy
>!When your alter go and ghost of your dead sister are fighting for your control!<
According to the artist's [twitter](), Sunny has to go to High School. Omori has to go to Middle School. Omori wants to go with Sunny. Mari is trying to stop Omori and send him to his school.  . . . (3 Sibling AU)
I kinda want to know if there are any fics regarding this au
I thought this was in reference to when >!Sunny moved out in the neutral ending, with Mari and Omori being personifications of the something that follows him and trying to get him to hold onto his truama!<. . I'm happy I'm wrong
Dude this is such a cute idea I love this
“I may have been created to keep you from rediscovering your trauma but that doesn’t mean that you can skip school Sunny!”
Omori: BUT I WANNA GO WITH SUNNY! LET ME GO, YOU OLD BAG WITCH!
Sunny: *suffering*
Sunny is VERY determined to get education
Loving how more people are making content with omori and sunny as separate entities
Sunny has some good grip strength
My friend has a theory that their mom isnt actually their biological mom, and shes a step-mom instead, but because their real mom left so early on in sunny's lifespan, he only knows her as his actual mom. . Which explains why she looks so different from everyone else
Hmm, that’s a cool theory. She does look pretty different from them tbh
Huh maybe we can reinsert Iniko into the lore and just make her bigger
Forbidden black space sequence: Sunny's dad with the pocket ravioli
ravioli ravioli...
What's in the pocket-oli
Sunny's dad left because his wife cheated on him with a black drone
The name Sunny is a predominantly Asian boy name, their skin is slightly yellow compared to everyone else's and the many japanese phrases and references such as Omori from the word hikikiomori but yeah mostly headcannon
there is a good chance that the many Japanese references are just a result of all of OMOCAT's work in general having lots Japanese items, references and e.t.c. . i'm probably wrong but i thought i might add that. Sunny is still probably Japanese
Well, I thought Sunny running around with a knife would obviously be bri'ish.
This some funny shit mate.
Opening their fridge also says Sunny can't recognize what's in there, which doesn't apply to any of the other houses
Is sunny really asian?. . I don't think so
"Tom Holland has been casted as Sunny"
This is the most terrifying sentence I’ve read today
Sunny needs to take a McChillpill smh
Don't McSay that in McEarshot or he'll McKill you too
McNot if I McKill McHim McFirst
Thinking you could mcchallenge the great one will be your first and last mcmistake
I McRealize that McNow
I can see Sunny having anger issues since he’s not used to showing emotions.
I do feel like Sunny would work his first job at a mcdonalds though
he just works there for the free food on the breaks lolol
uhhh hello can i get a McSunny thanks
McStop. . McSunny!
Can someone translate what sunny said in the first image?
touchy today, arent we sunny?
Au where Sunny works at Mcdonalds. He is now an Edgy edgelord XD
Oh hey sunny what you do-OMG WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?!
Snuuy :)
Sunneye*
>!OneEye!<
that was a little funny

Babey Snuuy
Bonus point if the whole group teases them both and Aubrey gets all  while Sunny just blushes madly with a poker face
I mean it's obvious they blushed alot as kids, they had a favourite spot at the swings too :)
snuuy gamer
Their dynamic is cute, and i feel Aubrey would forgive Sunny faster for the accident because she herself almost did the exact same thing if Basil wasn't saved.. . Feel she could empathize a lot with Sunny, and them becoming close friends and maybe starting to like each other is just adorable
The difference is though that sunny unlike her staged mari's death as suicide making her think she killed herself 
She would probably still be very very very  angry though
Oh yeah, definitely in the beginning
And i can agree to that. I mean Sunny is moving so they do have time to all like get better and accept and forgive.
Sunny's memories of crushing on Aubrey (in the lost library and memory lane) just break my heart. I also love the dynamic of the two, with Sunny helping to keep quick-to-anger Aubrey calm and grounded in times she wants to assault someone with her bat (think the swingset chat) and quiet, don't-want-to-be-a-bother Sunny having someone who will beat the crap out of anyone who approaches him. Win win scenario.
It's funny really, I could just imagine because he's so small she'd be a bit overprotective and defend him due to her bond. It's truly wholesome
i like sunburn as a concept, because they can be cute together, but i kind of don't like how people treat the characters in order to make it work a lot of the time.. . to me, it doesn't make sense that >!after 4 years of being separated, aubrey moving on and growing as a person, sunny... not moving on or growing at all, that they could just develop the exact same childhood crush and have that be considered healthy. it feels like people are treating it like just because sunny had a crush on aubrey, that means it's still definitely gonna happen 4 years later.!<. . also, sometimes sunburn fans go out of their way to try and cement their ship as "canon" (or "probably canon") due to evidence that i find shaky at best. aubrey blushes and gets flustered when she's emotional, and it doesn't really seem like it's specifically due to sunny. also her glancing toward sunny at picnics and giving sunny an emotional talk on the swings is... maybe it's something, but it's really not conclusive evidence for me at all.. . i like sunburn content when it actually feels in-character, and more like an actual developing teen friendship. that's really the thing, i think, i need to be convinced that their friendship is strong first before i can be convinced they have a good romance. they were apart for so long that i just can't see a romance developing instantly like that.
>!Sunny was traumatized almost beyond repair and youre gonna insult him for it💀!<
As much as I defend the Snuuy it's still a valid choice to dislike him for killing his sister
Is it? It's never fair or valid to fault someone for a genuine accident, if you ask me.
I think it depends on your pov. You can make the argument it was accident but what's done is done and unfortunately alot transpired during that time.. . Like I said I like Sunny and he's an amazing character but there was so much wrong with his choices during the 4 years
Yeah I like the dynamic between each member with Sunny as they are all different.. . I personally think the relation with Sunny and Aubrey is special and fits very well with how they cope with pain. The ever growing feeling they have is welcomed, as such I'm a Sunburn shipper but sometimes I take regrets because the fandom is so mixed whether if its good or not but I'll stay by my own opinion.. . I like how you expressed how they act around one another. Sunny and Aubrey definitely imo had it the hardest
I’d just say it’s because sunny/aubrey is the one most supported by the game. I’ve seen other ones like sunny/cris and sunny/mincy before.
i like sunburn bc they have a lot in common. . * they like capt. spaceboy & video games. * they have bad/neglectful parents. * they aren't very good at dealing with their emotions. * both of them fuck up, and in almost identical ways. * ~~thinking basil is sus~~. . i do think aubrey is/was closet to sunny after basil and mari, [for reasons i laid out elsewhere](). . > she's willing to apologize to him first and alone on the swings (if you actually get that scene), notices how thin and pale Sunny is before anybody else does and encourages him to take care of himself, randomly peeps at him in different scenes with the group, etc. Not to mention setting aside hours to talk to each other on the swings as kids. There can be platonic reasons for all of those, but I think there's enough for something more.. . while i think people making up scenarios where they get together during the in-game timeline is cute, i don't think things would go that fast; it has been four years after all and they have stuff they need to work on. so i think any relationship that develops would have to take place after the game.. . >!some folks argue that after the truth of mari's death is revealed, any kind of relationship between the two would be impossible. i think the opposite is true. aubrey's character arc involves her coming to realize that she should have been more understanding toward basil for him allegedly blacking out the photo album; it's because she wasn't that she wound up throwing out their entire friendship for years in favor of bullying him. for that matter, it's because she wasn't understanding enough that she is partly responsible, as she admits at the tree stump, for how the friend group broke up after her death, and in particular not being there for sunny. and all those realizations also took almost pulling a sunny and pushing basil down toward what would have been his death (and indirectly sunny's himself, since he jumped in to try and save him). more than any other character, aubrey is in the best position to understand sunny; i would like to think that's something she would try and commit to despite the truth. there's no better person to vent to about all your problems than someone who shares many of the same problems and i think they'd both find some level of catharsis just being able to talk about it with someone who knows what that feels like, even if it's hard at first. this doesn't mean she forgives him instantly or doesn't get super pissed at the hospital, but i don't think it would take very long for her to come around. !<
I think they're not really made for each other, and the crush that Sunny had, doesn't exist anymore (therapy is the best ship)
But he dreamed about it for four years tho?
She changed yes but she's still the same, can't blame her for even wanting to move past everything, she still cares alot about her friends, or she wouldn't spend the last day going with her friends, reviving her friendship and connect back to Sunny, it would be a waste and she definitely feels bad, she even apologised to how she acts in 3 and 2 days left.. . I think she really is the same girl from 4 years ago, she's been troubled, hurt and heartbroken, ofc she has every reason even though they are bad to act the way she does and her connecting bond to Sunny is proof she's broken inside.
I do agree with you on everything you said.. . I think I should clarify with what I meant by she’s changed. In Sunny’s mind he has a very particular view of Aubrey while the current Aubrey has grown up. She didn’t hide away from everything like him. . . The Aubrey that Sunny new as a kid doesn’t exist anymore. She’s experienced hardships, done things she’s regret (and is atoning and apologized for) and has a whole new friend group. . . She’s still the same person who loves her friends I just think she grew up and changed while Sunny didn’t.
Ah I see now, I just wanted to add on with my defense.. . I think you are right about everything, I must've looked at your comment the wrong way.
I didn’t explain myself very well in my first comment so it’s all good!
Exactly, I believe it was Sunny who kinda helped her ease all of the abandonment she suffered. She is the same after 4 years, just her delinquent personality changed alot of her, even the photo of her and Kim is a good example, she's the same but altered.. . I really wish people notice how much Aubrey cared about people, not to mention because of her personality in RW she must've been bullied in a way for her appearance to so Sunny uncoincidentally helped her come to terms with her faults
She blushed when she wanted to talk to sunny alone for exchanging contact info she needed to do it alone
that doesn't mean she's romantically interested in him though. doesn't even mean sunny is romantically interested in her too lol. sunny had a crush on her when they were 12 before >!the incident!< but that doesn't really mean he still has a crush on her after 4 years of not talking to her, and >!killing her best friend!< doesn't help either
I... Didn't mean that
what did you mean
Snuuy and obby
favorite part: they'd have a LOT to work out to actually be a reasonable possibility, imo. arguably more than any other mainstream Sunny ship. i think that gives it an interesting challenge for writers and authors to genuinely work for if they want to portray a realistic post-hospital version of them.. . least favorite part: the game basically doesn't give any clear indicators this is an option until Memory Lane. everything else is probably going over people's heads without hindsight (or without figuring out how lost library's namecode works by yourself).. . &#x200B;. . not my favorite ship but i think that's mostly because i was too deep in to be saved by the time i realized it existed-
It used to be a resounding meh for me, but I lowkey hate it these days lmao. I don’t think it’s healthy (and not in an interestingly unhealthy way, like some other ships I’ve looked into), their dynamic bores me (angry girl x quiet guy has never appealed to me, nor the constant infantilization of Sunny because “uwu autism-coded boy has to be treated like a child”), and I dislike sunburn fans after spending a few months in this fandom. It feels like Aubrey’s delinquency is often glorified and Sunny is made to act like a six year old in the sunburn I’ve seen. I’ve also quite frequently seen it called “canon,” but it isn’t and being canon doesn’t make a ship good. Forcing yourself to stick to canon crushes or relationships feels restrictive and boring imo.. . Edit: scrolled through the comments and wanted to add a little more. It doesn’t feel that thematically relevant aside from a few parallels, Aubrey is likely to have moved on (if she even had a crush on Sunny) considering that it’s been four years, and she has little reason to get hung up on a childhood crush the way Sunny did (who had no real perception of time during his isolation). I also forgor to explain one of the other reasons why I dislike sunburn shippers, which is the fact that a lot of them feel like they’re projecting their desire to date Aubrey onto Sunny + the fact they constantly shit on other ships (and the occasional bout of genuine homophobia/transphobia I’ve seen).
I can see Sunburn becoming real, if they would spend enough time together, but I feel like that this ship wouldn't work. Aubrey is very stubborn and doesn't explain herself well at all, which would be for Sunny too difficult to understand her and said stubbornness could lead to control and a lot of pressure to Sunny and we don't need to discuss how terrible such a thing is for him. Likewise he is too distant for her, she is better of with Kel, whom she mutually doesn't dread at all, this is the best aspect of their relationship. But back to Sunburn, yeah Aubrey is a bit too aggressive for Sunny and that comes from someone who likes the cute and quite boy and the strong and cool girl romance (Shikimori is a better version of sunburn and I love this anime). Yeah the lack of criticism towards Aubrey's behavior and the obvious ill-intent and astonishing lack of compassion she has is often ignored and she is overly sympathized by many, even by a therapist, who should have known better but then again, the same therapist saw no problem with Sweetheart's narcissistic self-marriage. . . I believe that Sunny accepted that he and Aubrey won't work, which is why he never even reciprocated it in his dreams and though they might have feelings for one another, it never amounted to much. Even if that ship is real, it would not be his most significant relationship, since he had always been more fond of Mari and Basil(for whom he risked his life twice). . . Personally Sunflower is the way to go and one of the illustrators is a supporter of this ship and Omocat knew that this ship would come, so they might have made the ship with romantic intentions in mind.
That's way more understandable it's weird and a bit gross hearing that people ship him with sunny even worse that it is or apparently was the most popular given it's zero evidence as i said i feel like people forcibly dissuade and shoo off the fact that dream world counterparts are based on their real life selves at that time to force the ships they prefer over it.
ive always interpreted it as onesided as of current (when their 16). Sunny may have held onto that string but i doubt aubrey did, lol. it could happen post canon dont get me wrong but i highly doubt aubrey has held romantic feelings for him for all these years, if whatever Sunny had going on even counts as such?? who knows if he holds holds them or if hes just holding onto something from his past. It really can be taken whichever way you want, if i recall correctly. . . I havent played the game in awhile, so correct me if im wrong.. . In the end though if your asking for my opinion on it, as much as i sound like a grumpy grandpa i just dont really care for it. Its ok and i can respect it, ive just always gravitated towards sunny x kel more, or just their friendship, platonic or romantic idrc i just think their neat. But i feel like a asshole shoving my shipping preferences in here.. oh well.
You're not wrong but the game makes it incredibly vague as to if it actually would happen, as most things it's up to interpretation for it to exist or not.. . I respect that you don't care for it, not everyone will enjoy or like it, as most for other ships. They have mutual bond or some connection but as you said they may not be attracted to eachother anymore.
Yeah i was prety sure that was the case, im glad i wasnt wrong there or else my whole comment would sound really stupid lol.. . sorry if i came off as disrespectful, either way, though, and yeah. With omoris open ending, anything could happen, really :p. I mean some things are kinda absurd, like sonic falling from the sky and causing a nuclear explosion but you get what i mean.
The game clearly implied it's mutual 
im willing to believe that 🫡 i dont remember even making this comment lol
There's the parallels between reality and dreamworld as well as memory lane and the scene of the two i don't really mind if you prefer a different ship i was just annoyed at peoples dismissal of the endgame implications
I feel like of the available Sunny ships it's the one that'd be least likely to happen, which I guess is why I dislike it. . . While we obviously don't know what happens post good ending, it's not too farfetched to assume that Aubrey probably goes back to hating Sunny for awhile. And even if she eventually stops hating him again, there'd definitely be residual resentment towards him that would never fully disappear, enough to prevent any real relationship.
Yeah while it's not my interpretation this would happen I can actually see why it WOULD happen, since yknow. Mari was like her sister and Sunny was entrusted by Aubrey as someone she could look up to, it'd definitely would hurt their friendship and she'd probably be extremely mad, but who knows
She never hated him what
The little crush Sunny had on her when young was cute to see, and in current time it’s nice to see her worry about Sunny on the swing and before going to his backyard.
>!I like how could be canon, since in the memory lane, Basil kinda confirms that Sunny has a crush on Aubrey, and in the real world, she gives some signs that it could reciprocate, but I hate that we'll know that because Sunny either dies or moves out before we even have the chance to confirm it.!<
I like the childhood friends dynamic a lot. I also think it's cute. I also like the idea that the main cast starts a D&D campaign and Sunny is the DM.
It’s ok but after therapy. Sunny still could do better
I’m not a big fan of shipping in general, but I just don’t really like how one-sided it is. Sunny used to have a crush on her as a much younger child, and his inner self still projects onto who the two of them were in the past. I don’t think there’s much actual chemistry between them.. . Then again, however, I do generally have pretty unpopular ship opinions. While I don’t really care that much about any of the ships, I personally am more inclined to like the idea of Sunny and Basil someday ending up together, since I’m a sucker for mutual healing. Overall, though, I much prefer thinking about all of the characters’ platonic bonds.
This was a two-year-old comment, so I’m not really sure how it even got replied to in the first place, but the headspace characters are, quite literally, figments of Sunny’s imagination. They do not exist in the real world, outside of brief hallucinations, and are therefore not the same as the actual people they’re based on. They are not “literally just them but prior to Mari’s death;” they may be similar to their younger real-world counterparts, but they are ultimately Sunny’s idealized, fictionalized versions of his friends that he has built up in his head as a coping mechanism.
I’m not “coping on it so hard.” They are LITERALLY figments of Sunny’s imagination, and portray what he wants his friends to be rather than what they actually are. I am going off of the actual canon of the story. Who they’re based on ultimately doesn’t matter, because being based on someone is not the same as actually being that person. They are not capable of thoughts, feelings, and actions besides that which Sunny projects onto them, and that is made abundantly clear throughout the story as his psyche becomes more and more warped and it becomes more apparent that his friends in headspace are his coping mechanisms. They are not real people, and they cannot be judged or evaluated as such. The only actual, reliable characterization we have of the friend group prior to Mari’s death is what we see in the photos, and even then it’s only a superficial perspective.
Sunny and Aubrey are both broken people and they can connect better than the rest of the group.. . Bonus points: Shipping Sunny and Basil is a disaster waiting to happen.
I mean they never address the fact sunny attacks her with a knife at that one point cause whoops I suppose.
Or the fact she was trying to beat him up
Sunny can't be with anyone in the series because he moves but it's still cute
I think it's okay since Sunny had a crush on Aubery.
If Sunny leaves town without telling the truth, he's most likely  to go back to isolating himself because of the guilt. If he didn't try communicating with his friends when he was in town, why would he try when he's elsewhere? Yes, he had 3 days to rekindle friendships, but in this end, nothings resolved and nothing has changed.. . If Sunny does tell the truth, then I think it would be Aubrey who wouldn't want to talk to him. >!If she can hold a grudge against Sunny for not being there for her after Mari died, then I can't imagine she'd be Hero levels of sympathetic towards him or Basil after she learns the truth.!< Yes she did say to keep in touch, but that was before she found out the truth. Her mind could have changed at that moment.. . Of course, this is just my opinion and I am someone who doesn't think a happy ending where everyone is best friends again is possible
>!Her entire character development is overcoming that grudge. Can't imagine she'd hold another one for very long after that. Plus she can understand better than anyone how easy it can be to act out of anger, she almost killed basil by drowning him at the lake. I do think she would forgive him after all that, even if it wasn't right away. Everyone forgiving Sunny and being best friends again may not be the most realistic, but I don't think we should focus on what's realistic necessarily. The game spends 20 hours showing you how strong their friendship is despite what happened and how everyone still cares for sunny, and a primary theme is how doing a bad thing doesn't make you a bad person!<
i like the ship on paper, but similarly to sunny x basil, it'd seem like there's almost no communication between them due to their psychological and emotional health. although it's my least favorite of the normal sunny ships, i feel like sunny x kel would be the healthiest.
Delinquent x whatever Sunny is, because I can’t quite find the right word, is really nice.
Sunny always looks confused/natural and for some reason I love it
The one thing I dislike about sunburn is femboy sumny, like I'm fine with a soft sunny (with the garbage fire his life has been you can't really blame him) but sunny Has committed murder and stabbed auby before and probably will again in the future just don't make snuuy a femboy
because i kin sunny
“ I practice with sunny a lot”
Stop. . I mean, I don't disagree... but stop
I’m the worst aren’t I
you´re right
why u tell my secrets...
Sunny wouldn't say shit, he'd let the knife do the talking
Nah bro omori’s gonna possess sunny for this one
Think the knife would hit the wrong target, if you catch my drift
I hate that this made me laugh
Nice pic. Out of curiosity, where did the rabbit that Sunny's holding come from
Sunny wearing two party hats to make up for his missing eye.
“Plot twist:”It’s for his Sis so he wear 2”
MY HEART
We know,it’s hurt a lot.
divde by 0 but you survive = sunny (when you say the word sunny just bass boost it)
Sunny was the imposter
One imposter left
Ah yes, Sunny, bed inspector, inspector of all beds. . . With all that time he was sleeping he should be able to point out a quality mattress.
People headcanon that when he gets older Sunny will get a job as a musician or game designer or something similar but the real based take is that he will get a job selling the softest, fluffiest mattresses known to man
: Sunny what is going on in your head
: How do you know about the stuff that's going on in my head?
: Um uh...Because im a..figment of your imagination?
: That would explain why you're so pretty.
: Bro...Thats very gay homosexual of you
: I know.
: *Phases out of reality*
: Bruh.
: There goes your boyfriend
: At least I didn't kill him myself.
: Tsk. Weak.
: You can't even keep your boyfriend safe for 2 minutes.
: I dont like gay people that's why
“Sunny”. . not omori
They probably just had a sleepover? Like the oldest Sunny could have been is 12, so I'd hope it's not a romantic thing.. . I ship them but not like that...
iirc Sunny's bed used to be Mari's. I also don't think that it has much to do with the bed itself but rather Sunny's connection to whoever owns the bed.
But >!in the sequence at Sunny's house before the Omori boss fight (or was it after? Idk) there were two beds in Sunny's room!<
Sunny deserves the Bed Inspector role
sunny bisexual confirmed ✅️
Is sunny a type of bed critic or….  
Funny thing is that Omori has/had good intentions and only wanted to protect Sunny... I give it a pass as it is a valid interpretation
Yes, that is what makes it sad, OMORI only wanted to help Sunny in the only way he knew, even if he didn't know the best
the path to hell is paved with good intentions
The bad thing is that those good intentions don’t have good morals behind them
Omori was like a loyal guard dog, he would do anything to protect his master, and didn't have the capacity to understand the consequence of that.
Yeah, it's like, Badeline,. . >!but alot more murderous.!<
Dude, this is a GREAT example. Some points are controversial, but still. At the very least, Badeline was simply afraid that Madeline would not be able to reach the summit, since she knew the power of the Mountain from the very beginning. And, well, Maddie didn't want to listen to her at first. Omori, on the other hand, decided to help Sunny, trying to kill him by guilt.
yep.
You're everywhere.
nah
I fucking love Omori x Celeste crossovers. People could say it and I'm sure most people would understand. And I agree, Badeline and Omori are basically mirror images (You know, >!Badeline DID try to kill Madeline with fucking lazers, spikes, and energy balls!< sooooooo maybe they are even more alike than you once thought before.
wheter or not that'd actually be fatal is debatable tbh,
>!Spikes and lasers and energy balls and whatever she does when she catches you in Chapter 2 all seem pretty fatal to me!<
To be fair, they do have a point. It could be interpreted that the spikes don't do much as Madeline was literally >!Falling through multiple sheets of spikes at the beginning of the chapter!< >!implying that most deaths may not really be canon and things thought up by Madeline. Simply trying to avoid getting hurt at all. If the spikes were all in her mind they who knows how much Badeline would actually hurt her?!<. . Though I would honestly argue those to be the most fatal hazards.
>!We know that Badeline is tangible while on the mountain (or Madeline has some mad telekinesis powers), so it's probably safe to assume the hazards are also tangible. There's an interesting theory that each death is Madeline overthinking about what would happen if she was killed by those hazards, implying they're not just in her mind and are tangible. As for falling through those crystals, you definitely got me there. Maybe they were Great Value!<^(TM)>!crystals or something.!<
Exactly what I am saying! I use "in her mind" as a way to portray that maybe those hazards don't really hurt her as much as she thought. I definitely agree with the overthinking theory as it adds to her character and even more context to the story. It is also even more interesting as >!In chapter 5 Madeline literally plummets into spikes as she wasn't prepared! She had no start of room to try to plan out what she wanted to do. She expected the confrontation with Badeline to go one way and that could be proven as in that scene it is impossible to die (normally).!<
Badeline turned into a fucking tentacle monster which shot lasers, omori is just a manifestation of sunny’s pysche
to be fair so was Badeline,. . its just that Celeste Mountain is hella magic.
yeah
omori is sunnys siblings Canon then lmao
Actually, no.  While it is canon that sunny often daydreams, it is unknown when headspace was created.  There can be a lot of 3 day loops in 4 years, and the fact that it’s all a dream makes the loops difficult to count.  One of the white space cutscenes suggest Omori was created after white space, and branch coral says white space is a place to survive, and therefore unneeded before “the incident”
…I’m not seeing how this counters what I said. I’m stating that Headspace has been through numerous resets, which is shown in Deeper Well:  . “When your intentions become hazy, they will transpire into this world like a thick fog. You will know when it happens. It has already happened before. […] Will you be doomed to repeat this cycle over and over? Or will you break it?”. . As for Black Space’s apparent growth, Kite Kid in particular gives a good hint off the top of my head:  . “[…]sometimes when I'm looking up at my kite, I catch a glimpse of a DARK VOID in the sky from the corner of my eye. I used to see it very rarely, but these days it's been happening much more frequently. I wonder if it means anything...”
Oh, I thought you thought that headspace was created before “the incident” like the comment you replied to did
I assumed the original comment was referring to the events of the game as “what happened,” so I officially don’t know what the heck is going on around here at this point.
"what happened" is >!ayo the pizza here!<
Be thankful you weren't born similar to Sunny, it would have been very confusing.
Sunny: "I'mma give you a boost!" *P2 boosts P1*
Mari: >!We did it Sunny! We beat the BabyStaircase% world record! I sadly had to give up my future for this but WHO CARES WE'RE FAMOUS! YAYYYYYYYY-!<
the game probably takes place somewhere in 1990 so I think sunny was born somewhere around 1980
Sunny at the top of the stairs😣. . A distant wahoo from Mari. . Sunny😱😨😨
sunny really said "=="
This is so wholesome and uplifting 😊❤️❤️❤️ sunny's little smile too..
People keep talking about Aubrey and Hero beating Sunny to a pulp,but everyone seem to ignore the fact that Basil was the one who put Sunny up to framing the murder as a suicide to begin with.At best,they would shun him,and at worst his head will be used as batting practice.
The whole game is about forgiveness, I doubt theyd hurt either of them.
Yeah, exactly my thoughts! I think Aubrey may come around to forgiving them, at least sooner than Hero would I think. It kinda helps (or hurts depending on your POV) that she was ALMOST in the exact same position as Sunny was when she pushed Basil into that lake.
I wouldn't say the game is about forgiveness, it's more about dealing with guilt and the journey to overcome it. Forgiveness is up to our interpretation.
The game is about forgiving *yourself* and coming clean, regardless of the outcome of doing so.. . There's no guarantee that the protagonist's friends would forgive *him*.
The wording of murder puts a bad taste in my mouth since Sunny never had plans of killing his sister. Both of them heated in the moment lead from yelling, to blocking the staircase, to Sunny pushing Mari. There was no premeditated plan to kill her. Basil on the other hand had to purposefully think of something awful to do which makes him a little more unnerving to me.
it’s better worded as Manslaughter
Isn't that what third degree murder is
CARROT YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN WITH THE BEAUTIFUL ART!!! The outfit Sunny is wearing really feels like something he would actually have on, including the face mask. Also, the little detail of Something in the background is really nice!
Ah yes, the SOMETHING in the distance. . Don’t worry sunny you can report them to the police for stalking
They can’t legally haunt you without consent
If Sunny was a city boy the plot wouldn't have happened >!because they would have gotten complaints from the neighbors about the music so no stairs.!<
>!The eye that Sunny loses in the Basil fight is covered, so this very well could take place *after* the true ending of OMORI - after all, Sunny does move away in all the other endings he survives in.!<
Pretty sure that was a joke doofus
they cant afford a city house with 2 floors so no stairs
I can't stop looking at this. Wow...
I-I want that hoodie

My headcanon is that Faraway is in New York, and Sunny moved from the suburbs to metropolitan NYC, so Sunny is now wearing a face mask because he has to deal with the coronavirus
Sunny would be a middle-aged man by the time COVID rolled in. . OMORI occurs in the 90s/early 2000s
he woul be 39 ot in his 40s not even close 50
I mean yeah but that's on the lower end of middle age no?

Bro looks like he's about to reveal a horrifying truth about my reality and/or offer me a red and a blue pill, and I mean this in the best possible way
Spoilers for entire game below. Please don’t spoil yourself for this incredibly dumb joke.. . Insert joke about Sunny being a Pinochet Stan and pushed her down the stairs because she was a communist.
No, he's clearly a CIA agent.
Lol
Mari forgets to give one extra nugget to Sunny. . The next day. . Sunny:Your time has come
Oh so that’s why Sunny pushed her off.. . A true patriot
Aww and she has a little eggplant Sunny to go with her too
Yup, very adorable

its sunny outside
Oh my god sunny from omori
Omori brain rot is real
Holy sh!t sunny from omori
The sunny with glasses PFP really sells this comment for some reason.
Damn

Glad to see another trans here! I'm agender and sunny is bae
sunny feels very trans-coded tbh
He kinda does honestly, you can even turn him into a girl in headspace in the hikimori route. I think part of it is Mari being such an integral figure to Sunny which rubs off some of the cishet energy. . . I personally thought Sunny was really strongly autism coded though I’m autistic myself so maybe it’s just a case of Sunny being very imprintable on.. . The community can get oddly hostile though when anyone says they feel Sunny feels x coded.
could you elaborate?
the big ones i’d say are the gender-change potion in the hikikomori route and the fact that the white space sketchbook drawing of the bathtub has a bra hanging up along with the rest of omori’s clothes
oh yeah that’s an interesting drawing, i have a post about it
why did this get downvoted, its just a harmless opinion 
i reupvoted tjat
based username 
probably someone downvoting all the trans comments, based on what i’ve been seeing
that sucks, i thought the omori fandom was more lgbtq friendly ):
Edgy teenagers infest omori(+me). At that point expect sw@ts!k@'s and s!ckles
Better call ~~Saul~~ Sunny!
 Hide the body. I'll go get the shovels. *This time* we're doing it right.
When sunny is more gayer
Sunny saying “I’m gayer” made my day.
He's a perfectionist, much like his sister 
I can greatly respect that 
I think I can predict how snuuy will die
>!Diving headlong down the Potemkin Steps in Odessa?!<
With great gay, comes with greater gay abilities
I’d date someone if that’s how they asked me out, strong confidence to say “I’m gayer”
I'll be using it as a meme forever now.
r/sunnflower
Ah, a fellow r/sunnflower member, always a pleasure to meet another.
Sunny like me Fr
sunny would make it a competetion even if they were straight
"I'm gayer" idk Sunny you're like the most bi person I've ever seen
>!Well, of course, he can be mad for Sunny killing Mari, but he is a wise guy, he would understand that it was an accident, Sunny has suffered a lot and he does not need any more suffering. So, for short, I think they will be understanding and forgive them.!<
Black bar goes brrr
How do you mark text as spoilers?
just use >!  !< and put your text inbetween to mark as spoiler
>!thank you!<
Sunny and basil ain't got shit on Sunny and Aubrey
Nah both ships are cute
Ones cuter though
I would disagree
*We* would disagree
Apes together strong
Yes
I like how sunny looks somewhat uncomfortable with it, it's like he just want to stay friends which i like
meanwhile, Sunny fantasizing about half a dozen Aubreys fighting over him in blackspace:
that's so cute!!. . also I dressed up as sunny at work yesterday but no one recognized my costume
unfortunate 😔nobody recognized us either if that helps
yeah, it sucks when nobody knows who your dressed up as. but at least I got a few compliments from my coworkers
where's the violin, Sunny...?

Aight damn, I'll sit down and listen. You got me.
I'd recommend against that... We haven't practiced much LOLL we sound awful
You'll get better with time haha, take it easy and don't stress too much about! You guys can do it!
Idc what the game says, THIS is canon and everything in the game is just Sunny having bad dreams
The achievement for getting 100% *is* called "It's all a dream..." after all.
Wowowow I neeeed to 100 game then
After Sunny wakes up he is just hugging his sister and friends as tight as possible
WE ARE APPROACHING MAXIMUM SNUUY CUTENESS
Aw, Sunny is so cute 
Kel: Oh, Sunny! Do Mari’s expre-. . . Sunny: No.
:Better?
:Hey, Sunny, want to see something cool?. . :Sure.. . :*A bit of magic stuff*. . :WHY DO I HAVE SPIDER LEGS NOW?!?!
yo my boy looks sick
damn he is ignoring us fr
He's such a fancy boy, he's fancy ain't he?
I headcanon this as Sunny after he moved away, let’s say 1-2 years after the good ending.
I hope he gets better :(
this boy got the drip 🔥🔥
He looks to be not giving a damn whatsoever.
. . Zamn he's drippy, he looks sick
Banging drip, my man.
If we counted from the time omori was published to today. Sunny would be around 21 years old now.... . 
Lore Accurately I'm pretty sure he'd be 36 lolz
I counted from the year when the game was published but this sounds even better.
And if we're going chronologically, assuming the game does take place in 2002 (there are a lot of reasons to assume this) he'd be around 39 now.
*Headspace* takes place in 199X, which is set 4 years before the real-world section, before the incident. So at the earliest the real world is 1994 and the latest 2003, so he'd be 47 at the oldest or at the youngest he'd be 38.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUNNY!!! (His watch says 1:43 btw)
Wow, nice catch! Didn't even notice
Birth
Give birth. . #NOW
Everyone else trying to look cool for the birthday art, meanwhile Sunny just got back from getting his groceries.

[Pretty princesses aren't restricted by gender]() when you got someone as cute as Sunny.
Aubrey in that one fight scene: PERCHE SEI QUI SUNNY STUPIDO MI HAI ABANDONATO! . . sunny: *cries trying to understand*
I hope sunny claims yet another victim
There are differences in level and tilt. Aubrey has far extending lashes and more pronounced lines indicating upper eyelids if you look closely. So does Sunny. Sunny dosen’t have the wing though, Mari does. Basil have different orientation of the lines of the upper eyelid and slightly more highlited line of the eye sockets (I’m not talking about his shadows, if you look at the sprite where his laughing, he has the same lines).
Well, it could easily be makeup. Let's not forget she put contact lens to change eye color and dyed her hair pink
Mama Mia Sunny is that a knife?!
I think it more like "SUNNY MA N'DOVE HAI PRESO QUEL COLTELLO"
Please draw (take your time) another image of Sunny just smiling back at her, love your artstyle.
will do! I’m so happy you like it!
Can't wait to see what you come up with! Your art is great!
This is so damn cute, Sunny's probably blushing like a cute dork too.
Imagine if at the end of a neutral run in Omori, Sunny accidentally created a dark fountain
Sunny creating a dark fountain in his own chest
. . Litterally this (artist @ghostopal\ from Twitter btw)
. . Reminded me of this
looks like he's having a stroke or a seizure, someone should call the cops
Kris is they/them
☝️🤓
So, >!Headspace?!<
headspace itself is like a dark world, just missing the fountain. . tho it's like if you created a dark world in sunny's mind, instead of his house (and well, no dark fountain)
Sounds like an interesting fanfic idea
I've literally been unable to get the thought of a platonic Kris / Sunny crossfic with the premise of "Sunny opens a Dark Fountain in front of Kris to try to bring Kris into HEADSPACE as a bid to be understood" out of my mind for the past several days how on Earth do I suddenly see this so similar idea in the wild
Hold on, this prompt is peak!
My lord, have mercy and please write this humble form of text
>!hit the ground too hard!<
Sunny is taking too long, maybe things took some kind of hikikomori route right now
Sunny is.... What did you say?

YOUR             LONG

YOUR TOO TOO
"Your taking too long" IS TAKING TOO LONG
YOUR TOO TOO IS TOO LONG

SUNNY TOO BRIGHT
wow! it sure is cloudy... almost as if things have taken some sort of *aborted sunny route*...
Looks like things have taken a *bad route*…
Looks like we'll need to *close* that door
Sunny was just in the darkworld for 4 years
Both Kris and Sunny carry a knife around and have been somewhat isolated from friends since something terrible happened years ago….
Haha Sunny >!My sister is alive!< 
oh really? >!lemme fix the problem *pushes her into the lake*!< 
We've seen Miku can swim.
wh.. why doesnt that spoiler work... whats happening...
can't have the big spaces in between (forgot the name). . >!this. . doesn't work!<. . >!this one.  does!<
>spaces in between. . [Say that again?]()
yea ok thanks. now the spoiler works
>!this works?!<
*pushes her into the river in lego city*
HEY !
Omg it’s miss pauling
hello there
Today I curse being a Spanish speaker, because of this post I ended up creating a theory (a joke theory) that the Mexican program known as "El Chavo del 8" is nothing more than part of Sunny's imagination 
also given the fact that it's sunny asking he's dead serious when he asks that, it's not even a joke
I was making a joke; as far as I know, there isn't an ending where Sunny and Mari make it to the recital and Sunny plays mayonnaise
I mean it's still a spoiler now but alright
How? It literally isn't a real ending
Yeah you changed it to be more sarcastic but it was a spoiler since there IS an ending where Sunny and "Mari" play the final duet.
I mean I just added adjectives
Final duet but Sunny plays a fucking jar of mayo
Fuck it, Final duet played with Armpit
eat your mayo and come back stronger
Lmao
Sunny just wanting knowledge. Complete WHOLESOME 100 moment. Take a wholesome :-).
gratitude
Imagine all the Violin images replaced by Sunny trying to play Mayonnaise
 Pogchamp, SUNNY!
: you're going places, SUNNY. One of them being therapy.
: f\*ck
🤝🏻🤝🏽. . (They are dragging Sunny to therapy)
I don't think sunny would fight it tbh
Nah he ain't fighting he just likes the feeling of being carried around by his friend that cares about him and the tomboy delinquent that cares about him.. . Also he couldn't fight them even if he wanted to.
Do you think sunny still crushes on aubrey or not kinda off topic but yk I sorta wonder
Aubery: sunny……are you…..saying you have a crush on me? . . Sunny:ummmmmmmmmmmmmmm
i love the idea of sunny just sharing his headspace dreams with his friends
If you fear committmeants for the same reason sunny do, probabilly yes
Sunny barely spoke in 4 years. . Must be quite a shock for one of his first  words to be "step on me"
Turns out he just didn't speak much because he was hiding his power level from everyone.
If he speaks he literaly exposes all his kinks he gained from surfing on the internet for 4 years non-stop
don't
>!Wait really? I thought Abby was a imaginary friend he made-up as a child- If abby does represent Sunny's lewd side...Oh boy Aubrey would be surprised- !<
I mean, there's more obvious proof. . Look at those squid girls. . They're the only ones in dream world who have boobs
Sunny you lucky bastard :)
I'm not entirely sure who that is, but it could be because I decided to add a partial mullet to him. Seen some other people do it to Sunny and I think it looks nice
Sunny is Peter Griffin confirmed
wow I guess i ate too much  (I hate it)
i wanted abs i guess my stats for luck is 0
Oh my god someone should edit Peter to look like Sunny
Sunny: Your little pogchamp 🗿

Bro Sunny got both bad bitches next to him
true

SUNNY and gang go to watch OMORBIUS
Aubrey doesn't care about gender, she cares about the Snuuy. And Snuuy transcends all genders.
Someone else said it in this post, but the girl Aubrey's kissing is very likely the original female Sunny design. At this point in the game's development when Omocat drew the art (2014), you could choose whether Sunny would have been either male or female. Pretty neat that Aubrey would have remained Sunny's crush whether he was male or female!
guess i missed the massive pigtails on that girl, mb
I was thinking it might be an earlier concept design with her hair down or something. Omocat's drawn several different interpretations of Sunny from what I've seen in her site (Mari, Hero, Basil and Kel as well have had different designs). Even Aubrey looks  different here with a Japanese school uniform and different facial proportions from the game, so I'm very interested to see what the behind the scenes for development for the designs was like!
okay. but why do you assume that aubrey's straight, anyway? apart from stuttering a little bit when talking to sunny (after she beat him up and talked about his dead sister insensitively and taunted him for being unable to go outside) , there's no actual proof she's attracted to guys at all, seeing as headspace is just sunny's ideal world.
Sunny: >!okay now I need you be near the stairs with basil and!<. . &#x200B;. . Aubrey: >!okay sunny, when I was  talking about doing roleplay, this isn't what I had in mind. this is getting weird and  you have some issues you need to work out!<
 sunny what are you doing youre scaring me. . stand right here and dont move, now start yelling at me. . 📸
now block the stairs
Somehow she looks more depressed. Guess she inherited the Sunny curse
I'm personally biased to Sunny's mom being negligent, but that's my opinion.
She left him just one steak for three full days despite knowing that Sunny is an hikikomori and that steak was rotten. If Sunny didn't eat at Kel's house he would have starved
She left him steak, enough money for an entire pizza, and potentially days worth of food in the cupboards and the closet (Hero cooked breakfast for Sunny on one day left, so there was clearly more food in the house than just the steak). . Also the steak doesn’t look rotten at all
she also left those sticky notes on the bathroom mirror reminding sunny to brush his teeth, a negligent mom wouldn’t even care if he did or not
A neglectful mom also wouldn’t be leaving him voice messages at all, and wouldn’t be encouraging him to go outside and reconnect with his friends
I mean they're moving into a new house and furniture is kind of important for that. Not saying she made a good decision here, but it makes sense that she might think her 16 year old son is capable of taking care of himself for an extra day
Other issues like not sending him to therapy or not seemingly doing much to help him at all.. . Not going outside at all for 4 years straight definitely isn't normal.
Why are we assuming that Sunnys mom just chose not to send him to therapy or didn’t even try to get him any? Maybe Sunny himself refused to get therapy, he seemed pretty content with doing almost nothing but lay in bed and interact with nobody all day every day so I’m sure it would’ve been hard for his mother to drag him out and get him to go to a place where he’s expected to open up and talk to a complete stranger. . . >	not seemingly doing much to help him at all. . How can you tell that from a couple of phone calls? She encouraged him to go outside and reconnect with his friends. That’s about the most she could do from where she was.
Hm, you've got a point though 🤔
Sunny was out of the house for most of 2 Days Left and 1 Day Left, he probably had more food but just didn't eat it
Makes sense
iirc the steak got rotten because they cut off the electricity though, i won't stop believing the mother was negligent, as it's still a single steak for three days, but the steak was unrefrigerated for hours, not rotten beforehand
They didn’t cut off all electricity, it was only the lights. Sunny’s ceiling fan, computer, bedside lamp, and oven are all shown to still work after the lights were cut off
then that's my bad. though this makes me question why wouldn't sunny turn stuff on other than the lights at night to, you know, be less scared in the dark
idk it didn't look like there was much in the house for him to turn on aside from kitchen appliances.. . I guess he maybe could've turned on his lamp but that would only help him in the bedroom
Hero cooked food for sunny on one day left, there was definitely other food, also it was only the lights, the other stuff still worked
idk, i'd think sunny's mother would've mentioned that there was more than one steak for sunny to eat if that were true. I share momomaltgern21's idea, that Hero bought (or brought from home) food to cook for Kel, Sunny and himself. . and about the lights, right, that's on me, i know. but since it's the second time i'm gonna also add that when lights go out here, it's because there's no electricity lol, so honest mistake.
Ah yeah that makes sense. Why didn't the mother think of this beforehand? 🤔 She could've bought buns with marmelade or peanut butter for Sunny. For what I know it doesn't really require any cooling
I think maybe the steak was never actually cooked.... . . Since the power was out. The microwave suddenly working when everything else was off wasn't weird to you?
Everything else isn't off. his fridge light worked, his table lamp worked, his ceiling fan worked, his computer worked, and his oven worked. It's only the lights that are out, not all the electricity.
I assumed that he was hallucinating all that. I don't remember checking the fridge immediately after. But I DO remember a note from the mom saying the power would be out for the night on accident.
Sunny did have food, hero made breakfast for them all on one day left, also, they had running water so he had stuff to drink. Also a parent can easily leave a 16 year old alone for a few days, most can look after themself, which we can see sunny can in the hikikomori route real world sections
Leaving Sunny was kind of the only option she had to prepare for the move. Plus 16yo seems old enough to take care of themselves with plenty of food and water
>A mother should NEVER leave their son at that age by himself. . Huh? Is this referring to *any* 16-year-old, or just one in the sort of state Sunny was in?
i disagree, as much as i love kel, i think that basil’s personality is much better fit for sunny. we only get glimpses of basil and sunny’s friendship before the incident, but he seemed like sort of a mentor to sunny (multiple images if them crying together, which implies that sunny was able to have serious discussions and show his emotions with basil, something that he wasn’t really able to do with anyone else other than mari). even with all his flaws basil is much slower paced and more thoughtful than kel imo, which is something that sunny needs.. . even in all of his greatness, kel neglects to show any care about or check in with how sunny feels about anything for the entire real world segment of the game, which is a flaw that most people ignore
Fair enough, I can respect your opinion, so here's my argument.. . Basil was socially awkward, had anxiety, he even staged Mari's death as a suicide which both messed up him and Sunny but the entire friend group.. . The worst thing Kel has done imo is attack Aubrey or just entirely dismissive of the reality of Mari's death. Like I get Basil is a sweet kid but is severely doubtful to the truth even not trying to visit Sunny.. . &#x200B;. . Kel is a charming and all-around cool kid, he is like Hero, he's a role model and tries to make the situation better. Even with is faults he is still looking out for everyone when trying to stay cheerful.
>Basil is a sweet kid but is severely doubtful to the truth even not trying to visit Sunny.. . He only gave up after Sunny abandoned him. He tried to reach out over and over. Stranger confirms this: . ​
There is no images of Basil and Sunny crying together tho? That's fake. And that flaw about not checking Sunny's state goes for everyone (including Basil), except Aubrey, who worries about him in the swings.
Yeah Kel DID attempt to contact Sunny, as Sunny's mother tells us. He even tries to get him to go outside.. . Even Sunny's mother tried to persuade Sunny to do it too. Kel is flawed like all characters but has the most impact in saving Sunny's life as he was a hikikomori.
basil asks if sunny’s ok and asks why he looks so scared in the rw segments, even if it takes a lot of strength for him to get the words out. he just doesn’t get a response. there are glimpses of basil and sunny crying together in the photograph sequences between headspace and faraway town
Basil tried many times to spend time with Sunny after the incident, and Sunny completely abandoned him. RW and HS confirms this.
More like Sunny was Basil's best friend, but Kel was Sunny's best friend
Exactly how I see it 
>!Or maybe they changed after 4 years and the incident!< 
Without trauma it means that like, Sunny wouldn't be inside his house for four years sooo.. that doesn't really count or anythings
It’s a completely hypothetical situation, you can use any reasoning to disprove it. . Clearly just go along with the situation presented
I always had the impression that Basil considered Sunny to be his best friend of the bunch, while Sunny didn't necessarily have a favorite, at least outside Mari.
I believe that's why imo Basil does apologize beforehand, even if indirectly during the incident yet instead of helping positively those words became engraved inside of Sunny's mind and that's why every Something variant apart from Sunny and Basil's main Somethings say the distorted words of "Sunny, I'm sorry".
Also Basil is depicted by Sunny as the most morally upstanding and kind-hearted Person in Headspace, even more than Mari, whom he not only can deny being always great, but has her sometimes teasing Hero and being too soft on Kel and Aubrey. Basil showed empathy towards Boss and was still clear that he should not cause too much trouble, while noticinghow little boss wanted to hurt him. He was also the one we saw in the first cutscene with Sunny and he was always depicted as special to Sunny and they even wear the same clothes in the present. . . This is a very deliberately design choice of Omocat to show how similar they are and how much they are alike, almost like twins and doppelgänger. . . In the end, while Basil did made things worse, his love for Sunny, him being there for him when he needed him the most made Sunny positive enough about himself to really live with his life as long as he could and ultimately the memory of being helped by Basil and all of their good times made him remember the truth in the first place. . He did helped him ironically more than he thought.
I tried spoiler-marking but this...goofy interface wouldnt let me. . But there shouldnt be a problem since the meme itself is a spoiler. . Yes I know its a meme and I'm sorry for what you're about to read but I heard many people still hate Basil with disturbing passion and. . And I'm bored. . Basil must've had a pretty dark and messed up mindset. His grandma has been taking care of him for his whole life. She wasnt probably of best health since she went into catatonic state, which I presume doesnt happen often even among older people. We can assume she has been feeling that way for quite some way now, and her sickness peaked a few months prior to the events of the game, resulting in her falling into a 'coma'. So Basil was probably not taken care of enough, he didnt have parental figure and mustve felt pretty lonely overall, even if he had friends, because his house was not entirely his 'home'. Also, in Sunny's memory we can't see his grandma participating in the celebration of Basil's birthday, so we can assume she wasnt fit to do much things for him \[although this point is a bit, hm, hazy\[?\], since Sunny may have 'erased' adults from his mind on Memory Lane because he wanted to focus on friends\].. . !My point is, Basil had quite sad childhood which probably resulted in him having darker worldview. I headcanon he also found some messed up stuff online since he had nobody to supervise him and stuff. If he had access to Internet at all ofc.. . Back to the point! Ofc the idea of faking your friend's suicide to cover up for your best friend's crimes is messed up, but that how Basil's mind was. Besides, he mustve feared losing his friends, especially Sunny, who was his best friend back when they were kids. His friend group would surely break if they found out Sunny murdered Mari, and Sunny himself would 99.99% leave his ex-friends \[idk if 12yo can be put into juvenile in USA, I really doubt especially since Mari's death was an accident, but if police was informed about all of this, the word about Maris' death would prob get out and all citizens may have started despising sunny's family, so they'd prob move out and stuff...or sunny might've went to some mental health facility or sth\]. Besides, it all was extremely traumatizing and shocking. Basil and Sunny probably shared a bit deeper bond, and seeing your best friend scared fecesless because he accidentally killed his sister and frisked up his whole and other people's life, not even on purpose, and the overwhelming feeling of 'it could've been so easily avoided'....bruh, they were 12. Sunny had no idea what to do, so Basil took initiative and prob. decided it'd be better to hide everything and hope that everything would be back to normal in some time, rather than letting the terrible truth out. Well, the consequences wouldnt be extremely pleasant.. . Maybe he also didnt want to see his friend as a killer. He thought of the whole "something" thing after all. It wasnt Sunny who killed Mari, it was something. Something stood behind sunny, it mustve looked like he was the one to push her, but he didnt, something pushed her, not Sunny. Something scribbled all over the photos, it wasnt Sunny. \[Or maybe he was afraid of Sunny and tried to please him by saying he wasnt guilty so that he wouldnt hurt him next; I want to say its just an unlike theory, but it makes a bit sense. . Like yea they couldve called 911 but they were kids, shocked by the sudden tragedy. People lose common sense when theyre scared.. . So, was the idea of faking suicide absolutely terrible? Yes. Was it understanadble? Yes.. . ok next point. . Basil has extreme anxiety, frequent panic attacks and has been overwhelmed by extreme guilt and shame for the past 4 years, he has no friends, his grandma probably couldnt be much support for him, not mentioning she fell in a coma a few months before events of the game, hes been bullied by his former close friend, he has hallucinations and doesnt receive any help. Not at all. Not from a psychologist, not from his friends, he cant even go to his grandma and tell her 'i feel sad, can i get a hug/can we talk', because shes practically dying at this point (on the wiki it says that his grandma probably died on one day left). Whenever we see him he's extremely stressed out, nearly all his sprites show him either sweating, frowning, crying or being sad in general, in fact I dont think he has ever smiled happily in the real world (except for secret cutscene).. . He and sunny were supposed to be together in their guilt and shameful knowledge, they were supposed to bond by their trauma and maybe help each other get through it (Basil says "promise me we'll always be there for each other"), but they didnt, Sunny barely went outside in the span of 4 years, not meeting any of his friends, not communicating through any other means. Ofc he'd feel betrayed when his partner in crime suddenly leaves the town without saying anything. Like yea, they didnt talk for nearly half a decade, but maybe the thought of sunny still being close and living basically a street away somehow comforted Basil. Maybe he thought that Sunny was the last person with whom he could speak and feel positive emotions without feeling guilt and stuff, but Im not sure since he basically looks scared of Sunny.. . Ofc Basil'd need to be saved, he's so stressed out I'm surprised he's even alive at this point. Its a headcanon, but I think he may also have agarophobia (a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong, some/most of people basically are scared to leave their house, others can go out but with a trusted person that will know what to do in case of emergency/won't judge them for e.g panic attack and stuff). He went out like 2 times, but it was in order to retrieve photo album. Looking at how much stress he experiences daily, how he's bullied, and how terrible he feels, I'd say he managed to go out solely because he was really determined.. . There was no time for Basil to apologize for his mistakes. After the fight we only see his sprite and maybe a short animation of him, he doent get to say anything but he'd surely apologize to Sunny after their emotions calm down. Talking with him and making a good apology would surely be hard for him considering how he felt towards his best friend for the past 4 years, but I'm sure he'd eventually get there and have a serious conversation with Sunny.. . Sunny and Basil's relationship is complicated, Basil is clearly scared of him despite wanting to keep close 4 years ago, maybe he's scared of what he might do, maybe he reminds him of the incident, maybe he's scared he might tell the truth, or he's scared of the 'something'. Honestly I forgot a lot of things despite finishing the game this week. Good thing I'm replaying it again rn.. . The things Sunny and Basil did cant be fully judged imo, because they were kids, not wanting to have their whole lives destroyed, one of them potentially mentally scared. Of course faking suicide was a huge mistake, but we can't just leave it at 'guilty' verdict (even if its just a video game, hm, i need a life).. . As teens, Sunny and Basil are both extremely mentally destroyed, have phobias, psychosis, panic attacks and all the good stuff that came free in a package of 'trauma after commiting a felony'.. . ~~So, no, Your Honor, Basil isn't necessarily a bad friend.~~. . Um actually Your Honor do you accept headcanons as evidence??
Hmm yes you do have a point(s)
This was my only "complaint" about the game to any degree. The only part that ever legitimately puzzled me was how they were selling Basil as someone so close with Sunny when Sunny hardly ever seems to acknowledge him in the photos or rest of the game. Even though Sunny is pretty reserved, he still seems to acknowledge everyone else more at every point. You get maybe one or two pictures, but it always seemed like Basil had a much higher opinion of Sunny than Sunny has of him. Basil might have considered Sunny his best friend, but like OP says Kel by far acts like Sunny's best friend way more than anyone else. I wish they had shown more of Basil and Sunny being best friends than simply telling us that was apparently the case. Basil has always been my least favorite of the main cast because he feels like a plot device more than a character, and even when he is a character, he feels like the most stereotyped to me.
That was in Sunny’s head. The scene didn’t happen in the real world as Sunny and Basil are both in the hospital.
Acctually he CAN'T beat the 6 bullies but ok. The thing is, while Kel might be a better kind of a friend Basil and Sunny have a better connection with each other. Kel isn't a quiet guy like Sunny, Basil is. Not like quiet plus "loud" kid combination can't work out and is bad, it's a great combination but i feel like Kel is someone Sunny befriended and would spend time with a third person like Aurbey rather than spending time with just him alone.. Basil just matches Sunny's personality so it's no wonder Sunny considers Basil as his best friend.
Basil has severe abandonment issues and it was shown in the Omori route that he genuinely reached out to Sunny after Mari's death, and Sunny spent years in his own head making up scenarios where he saves Basil and he ultimately does in the real world in both the good and the bad ending of the Sunny route. Post-good ending, it seems genuinely plausible that they could get together because they forgave themselves and each other for what happened, and both of them still seem to love each other, although whether it's romantic or platonic is kind of up to interpretation.
Kel is such a good friend to Sunny in RW that it actually makes me a little emotional thinking about it. Not only does he never give up on trying to help Sunny out of his house, but he’s genuinely just so kind, and thoughtful of other people’s feelings (ie asking Sunny if he wants a high-five instead of just doing it). As well as always making sure Sunny is a part of all the conversations that go on, and making him feel “heard” even if he doesn’t speak, and it never feels like he’s pity-ing him either. Kel is like the best friend someone in Sunny’s position could ever ask for.
i would like to see sunny as a vamp
Sunny a Vamp fr 🧛🏽‍♂️
There's literally a fanfic of this exact concept lol. . [
Oh, you mean Dead Star?
Cool, I want to draw that now xD can I use this idea
>!Sunny's bandages look familiar!<
MUMMY SUNNY
Sunny's gangly looking fingers though
“Sunny, may you do me a favor?”. . . “Sure.”. . . >!”Make sure to don’t push our daughter off stairs, thank you.”!<
>!Delayed Abortion!<
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Lol. . >!Hope not!<
>!Then years later, they have baby boy who then proceeds to push his sister down the stairs!<
“Learn from your mistake”
The past repeats
Mari:”ok then how about I give Sunny daughter special power so you can stop make joke about stair and no trauma allowed ?”
The pizzas arrival can't be halted
The pizzas arrival can't be halted
foolish of you to assume Sunny >!wouldn't avoid houses with more than one floor after that!<
Problem is, in the fanfic SUNNY re-buys his old house to live with Auby (atleast I think)
sunny when will you learn that your actions have consequences
Lmao
>!" I won't promise, Honey."!<
Imagine when she grows up and she brings over a boy to the house.. . (Battle transition). . Boy: **STRESSED OUT**. . Sunny: (looks HAPPY but is actually FURIOUS)
Sunny's daughter:Dad Why do you have an eye patch? Are you a pirate?. . Sunny:It all started when I was 12...
I'm glad Sunny didn't miss his growth spurt.
Sunny used all the money he got from working during those last 3 days to buy an elevator
Why does Sunny looks like gru
adult sunny looks exactly how I imagined him, this is an awesome piece!
Btw guys Sunny’s not angry, he’s just having concerns about his little girl’s future.
I like how sunny still has the patch on his right eye
sunny's ghost adventures be like
5. >!It was actually Mari who pushed Sunny, but he wasn't that badly injured because of how short the fall was. It was Basil rushing downstairs and falling on Sunny with his camera in hand that put them both in the hospital. The game ends with Sunny waking up from a coma.!<
>!"I have to tell you something. Mari didn't kill herself. I killed her. I pushed her down the stairs."!<. . >!Mari steps in behind Sunny.!<. . >!"Sunny, what the hell are you talking about?"!<
>!*Everyone in the room screams,even Sunny*!<
"Uh...A ghost!"
One of the few "It was all a dream" theories that make the characters lives better
I wish there was a fanfic where Past and Future fused
there are actually a couple of them in existence. . The Bridge is one which just was recently completed.. . Lost and Found is another one that's a bit more, I guess comical? It's not exactly *funny* but it is a little bit more light hearted.. . There's also a few where >!Sunny from OMORI travels to a world of the OMARI AU, or vice versa.!< This includes Miracles, I Won't Let Him, Broken Mirror, and Second Chances.
I knew The Bridge and I Won’t Let Him before making this comment, thanks for giving me some others to read!
What happens if this was all just in sunnys head and he was in a coma for 3 years after he fell down the stairs
but then she’d be sad :(
Yeah
I mean theres alot of that stuff in ao3
I can see why she push Sunny too much since she got a reputation to keep.
Same. >!And I guarantee the first thing people wanna know is if Sunny is the killer!<
Sunny Susuki
Awh man… but Sunny’s birthday is coming up so I think it might be something… they are drawn differently kinda if u look at the hair it’s more realistic-lookin. Please please not just be art 😭😭🙏🏻🙏🏻
It's probably nothing.. . 
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUNNY THAT WHAT IM ASSUMING ITS ABOUT
Weird take: there is sequel potential here. One of the scenes with a certain ghost indicates an afterlife and something much greater to headspace. Theres also some subtle interactions between headspace and faraway town which indicates a sorta greater supernatural phenomena to the game. Perhaps this ghost can't pass on and needs some help. Which I think having a sequel game of the theme of letting go pairs well with acceptance. So while Sunny himself completed this, his friends might not have.
Maybe they could focus on what happened with the others during the time sunny spended locked up, like an prequel game.
>! Isn't we already know what happened   !<
Yeah, we know, but we didn't "see", thats just an idea though, because i cant see an sequel being something more than that.
WE FINALLY KNOW SUNNYS COLOR
... That's actually Sunny from Omori, not Omori from Omori.
Brad had it worst. . Ness had it best. . Sunny is in the middle
Sunny had it terrible. Probably 2nd worst.
I think brad was the one who had it the most worst
very late but Lucas had It really bad for very spoilery reasons
Do you see my username
brad did indeed have it worst, im backing you up broski
Wayne had it fucking radical
Yeah honestly Wayne had it best. Beat up a tyrant and uhhh become toothepaste I guess? But he seems into it so it's ok
At least he got to live in joy at the end of all things...
idk if living as a joy mutant is a very nice exsistence i think id rather die
I badly want Sunny in Smash Bros. I mean an they got Steve from Minecraft
Wayne and Sunny would be weirdo pals
>!It’s Sunny not Omori!<
You are right I Copypasted another comment. I guess we are just so used to omori as the main charachter, he Is usually the one that gets all the non-spoiler fan art comment
Keep Niko away from Sunny at all cost
Isn't the person below Sunny the guy from LISA
Yes
what's the top yellow one?   . . . ik all the others; ninten, ness, lucas, frisk, madotsuki, brad, the batter, sunny, kris, niko, and lonely girl
apparently wayne from hylics, for the longest time i also had no idea who he was
hm, i've never heard of hylics before
good game hylics 2 is also fire
it looks trippy asf
Lucas, Ness, Ninten, Madotsuki, Brad Armstrong, Frisk, Kris, Sunny, Batter, protagonist of Escaped Chasm, idk the character at top, Niko
Why isn't Sunny wearing any shoes? Why is there mold in his armpit?
Hes wearing flip flops and its just the shading of his torso
Sunny canonically likes Chocolate ice cream lads
He apparently likes biting it too
Sunny/Omori and Kris aura farming competition.
I just wanna die -Sunny2020
Dawg why does Sunny look like he’s about to crash out 😭😭😭
They may be smol, but it is the trauma demon that told them to kill themself lol
I mean... Reasonable?? Omori is a dream creature, but mini-Kris is like actually real
(a few days late but ignore that). . given the nature of dark worlds it’s kinda shaky, but i guess mini-Kris can straight up kill them so it’s real enough
He was dealing with his inner demon, now he deals with it but carried by another quirky knife carrying silent teenager's demon.. . "Preppare for trouble". "And make it double"
He knows how well-received Kris' crashout was compared to his own
No, you’re Sunny, you silly duck!
No fr sunny fucking attacks every person he meets in faraway town. . The fist day is everyday
Even I don’t know how to spell gorgeous without auto-correct. Can’t blame Sunny honestly. 
Georgeous. . Go back to school, SUNNY
I omor 
No, you're braindead, SUNNY
I'm gonna banish you to the dark space
Honestly Sunny strikes me as someone who's very good at spelling, so the joke didn't quite hit for me. The art is peak though
maybe hes washed after those 4 years
Hilarious, but pretty sure high literacy is one of the few known character quirks Sunny has
Hi Deskface, can you tell me when will the Sunny come out? I love Sunny the most, so this is somewhat serious.
Maybe a few more weeks? Because I'm pretty busy with commissions right now
Oh thanks!
She looks... disappointed
"Sunny, please brush your teeth this time."
sunny. use your fucking deodorant.
#EAT THE DEODORANT
# SUNNY, YOURE NOT SUPPOSED TO SWALLOW THE MOUTH WASH
Look at me, Hector
Don't swallow the shampoo, Sunny. You're gonna die.
sunny, please dont masturbate in the bathroom this time.
As a person with younger siblings, its surprisingly easy to tell they do that
how
They leave evidence and are in the bathroom for too much time
what's "evidence"?
Are you taking constructive criticism right now or do you ask me that for fun? I don't want to continue this conversation
oh, sorry it's completely okay if yiu don't want to continue this, i'm sorry for making you uncomfortable
Evidence includes: samples, lotion, slimy toilet paper
I-
Sunny, please don't throw me off the stairs this time.
that's... why >!she died!<
His bad breath did it
lol Haha
Welp, I'm less terrified.
No she is reaching out to help Sunny brush his teeth through the mirror, how considerate!
No shes tall because >!thats how sunny remembers her dude. not cause of the hanging. the last time sunny saw her she was much taller than him, so of course he'd imagine her still being that tall!<
I have to say, I’m definitely more terrified lol
So is this her ghost being disappointed in Sunny or?
Nah Sunny's just short. He's 4'10
Literally a midget. . Edit: okay this was a bit mean from my part
>!you mean the “nothing but scratches” described in the truth album? the violin that was hidden away in the toy box, that there was no reason to look for? no, they didn’t.!<. . >!plus from a storytelling standpoint, it takes some of the blame off of sunny, which is not the point of the story at all.!<
Sunny: **Yesn't.**
Well, i got some theories about that. Gonna spoiler it all just to make sure.. . >!The first one is all these "appearences" are all in Sunny's mind, including this one. But the difference to one from another is the state of Sunny's mind.!<. . >!The night that this Mari appears happens in the dawn of the last day before the moving day, so some progress towards Sunny's state of mind have been made. That means he's not that fucked up as he were when he was isolated at home. Where i want to go with this is that the hallucinations that Sunny sees reflect in his state of mind, being Hellmari the worst, and this Mari the """best""". Hellmari is how Sunny thinks Mari feels about him (unconsciously of course, he doesn't know the truth yet), a distorted beast brought to life just to make Sunny suffer. And this Mari a more "clean" sense of how he think Mari feels about him, she just wants to make Sunny move on and be happy, but that can't happen without revealing the truth.!< . . >!The other theory is basically the same, but all the hallucinations is just Mari's spirit trying to comfort Sunny, but Sunny can't exactly see her in that way.!<
So she's basically just >!hanging around!< then?
I feel like if you didn't put spoilers then the people who don't know would be like "what, what's so funny? I don't get it!"
I'm pretty sure that's just >!Mari's ghost!<, if i remember correctly >!this happened if you went to the bathroom after her spirit is playing the piano!<. . And the reason why she's so tall could be because Sunny always saw her as his big sis, but i'm just theoririzing here
~~Bigger sis~~
>!or because she’s hanged but not neck broken hanged.!<
no its because sunny hasnt seen her in like 4 years, she is basing her height on how tall he remembers her as because a 15 year old would be way taller than a 12 year old.
i see what you did there.. . edit: okay, i'm starting to question if people are actually seeing what i'm seeing because the rest of the comments seem to be completely different to what i had in mind.
What did you have in mind, I'm interested
>!well normally, the mirror shows sunny with shadow mari looming over him in the background. when OP brightened the image, it revealed a part of mari's face, but i didn't think it was that significant.!<. . >!I thought OP's title was "So I brightened the mirror scene in Sunny's house and discovered...\[ something \]." !<. . >!if you ignore the torso, just focus on the head, and see the face as an eyeball; it's sunny's something. honestly, my take might be far off.!<
Wait… y’all don’t know that Mari is >!Sunny’s Something?!< I thought this was common knowledge
Omg wait it really does look like that
Whenever I see this version of her it makes me sad. Like she just wants to hug him but can’t.
Necro post!. . 2 years late but this comment really resonated with em. . While it is unnerving i agree that something about it seems more sombre and sad then scary. Like it could be sunny imagning when she was still alive, behind him as they got ready for school. . IT also gives the vibe of a ghost/Spirit of mari being sad/depressed that Sunny is beyond saving. So she just....watches. She cant interact or help him. She can just watch
yeah, she's just dissapointed that sunny didn't brush his teeth/took a bath/changed his clothes/used deodorant in 4 years and is questioning if she should ask god to let her come back to life and take care of her little brother who apparently forgot how to take care of himself while giving him the biggest scold she ever gave him
Sunny's 16 but he's still smol even though he and Mari are now the same age
He spent 4 years not stepping outside once and barely eats and when he does eat, he pukes it back up. He's not healthy at all.. . >!He's barely taller than Omori looking at both the cutscenes post Omori fight.!<
To be fair, he through up the steak because it wasn't cooked.
That was funny af lmao. U think he just hallucinated the microwave and all or it was just a developer error?
I've seen people say it was a hallucination, so I'll say yes
At least he goes to a hospital in the main route
Sunny's fucking malnutritioned, of course he's small
*clueless*
Spoiler tag dipshit
What does dipshit mean?
It's an insult
Dang :c
Well, guess what? There isn't a ghost behind him, it's his mind playing tricks. And of course, a little brother will always remember her sister as bigger than him.
Y'all ever notice that sometimes you can see the outline of this Mari watching Sunny during the cutscene where he's going to bed? The moonlight sometimes looks like her.. . I think the first night before you see Kel.
Yeah I noticed that too on my second playthrough, scared the shit out of me.
Oh yeah, my first playthrough I thought i saw something but ignored it because i couldn't make out what it was.. . Then my second playthrough... yikes.
Discovered...What exactly?
Somehow this makes me wanna shit my pants even more
She got the 🗿 face
It's her Sunny impression.
Happy cake day
Happ cak dae
"**Sunny you haven't changed your clothes in 3 years.**"
Why the fuck did i have to see this before i shower☹
"Sunny, can you budge over a bit? I need to brush my teeth.". . "Who's that looking at us?". . "What?... Sunny you need-". . "From behind the screen."
Holy shit!
>!She's protecting her bro!<
Close
Her arms are more long than >!the hospital!<
No that's hero with a black blanket over his head. A roach flew across his face in his college dorm, and his fear teleported him to Sunny's backside for a split second.
I don't know if this is must tagged spoiler or not?
I need to test this myself too
I like how Sunny's 16 and Mari is still taller than him
"Sunny, I found the pizza."
She's so tall...
I mean she is hanging out
So it isn't a demon!
Are we not gonna question how long her arms are
She's gonna be a character in ARMS 2
What surprise me the most is that she has facial parts and not just a blank face
What is it
That's the one that's only in the neutral ending, right?
It's in all routes except the Hikikomori (Second day sleepover at Sunny's house, after hallucination/spirit Mari talks to Sunny)
Brb gonna cry again
why tf do the mari stand beihnd the sunny sio creeply?????????????  . :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
“Hey little brother! You mind if I just ascend real quick?”
Idk why people are saying spoilers for this, Mari is taller then sunny, and looking at photos they sunny is slightly taller then before but Mari is still a God damned basket ball twitter.
Oh wow she has mouth haven’t noticed that
Omg no way a door
I gently open the door…
Isn’t this what it looks like normally
wheres goku
mari: sunny wash your fuckin hands we are in a pandemic >!i didnt die and then decide to haunt you just for you to ignore me!<
HER ARMS ARE SO LONG
She looks so pristine
"I'll be here"...
She got LONG arms.
She's freakishly tall but I feel bad :(. . Kind of like mari sees how much sunny is suffering, how much she wants to be there with him.. She has.. For 4 entire years.. 4.. And all she can do is watch
“Sunny are you finally gonna do something else beside staring at the mirror in the bathroom?”
I was hoping there would be a very faint impostor silhouette in the door frame too, but this is good I suppose.
Update: I've been looking through the spriter's resource to see if she has eyes, but it seemed nobody has ripped this sprite yet. It looks to me like it's the same sprite as the outline that can be seen when falling asleep, but I do not know.
I'm chill with normal Mari ghost. This picture seems like she is about to hug Sunny 😢
Ohhh, I didn't I saw that she had a face in this scene.
Hanging out
Aww, cute
I like blue
Maybe spoiler tag?
Good god, has that always been there?
WHAT I did not now that
what a good sister
Damn that’s awesome, i had no idea this happens
Spoiler this
Oh shit she's tall. . Looks like Slender will have some competition
Ok where’s Goku?
You shittin me op?
I don't get it. This is just one of the things that appears in the mirror when you check
I dont think she is >!hanging because 1. her arms are way too long and would be reaching her knees if she was being lifted up. 2. well this concept art does not include her hanging out.!<. . 
Nah it's not that she's hanging, it's that she has a mouth! And looks unamused.
yeah i know but a lot of people were arguing if she is or not and i just wanted to point out my thoughts
Yeah.  Honestly, ignoring that, the rest of his behavior was extremely concerning to me when I played the game.  I kept on worrying about him, and Sunny's >!inability to comfort him in the bathroom scene really hurt.  I get why now, but still, please give the kid a hug and definitely some sort of professional help.!<
The bathroom scene fucking hurtttttssss
Yeah.  It is probably the most painful one to me.  Especially with >!Basil begging Sunny not to leave him.!<
He also mentioned how weird it is that Basil's first line to Sunny was how glad he is to see Sunny again even if for just a short while. And that line was said before he found out Sunny was leaving.
REALLY???? Oh my god. This is all ive ever wanted out of an omori letsplayer 😭
YOU'RE SO REAL FOR THAR
*. Did you see him draw a Johari window inside a Johari window once he realized that omori has been the blind spot of sunny? Great analysis.
LMAO I loved that he did that 😭
its like a revelation has been made. it was beautiful
Just finished watching! I love the series! He’s really good at picking up on the little details and I love his commentary.. . Also it is now my headcanon that Sunny’s middle name is Brady.  I like how he says “Little Sunny Brady”
I remember that I paid 4 dollars for membership immediately when I had seen how he stood in front of the mirrow in Headspace and said "Oh everybody is dead, so Sunny is depressed because of this".. . HE IS SO GORGEOUS. I'VE ALREADY WATCHED ALL HIS VIDEO.
I am thirteen minutes into the first episode and he's already figured out a lot about sunny's mental state just by poking around white space a little lmao. I love this type of letsplay. I'm so excited to see what he thinks of everyone else.
Well he is definitely Sunny's comfort character
**Both** comfort **and** discomfort character!
It's funny that a coping mechanism became a coping mechanism.
u/unstableidiot1032 Well, I'm depressed now 
The thing that the majority of people (afaik) don’t understand is that Omori is not evil. He’s not trying to hurt Sunny. He’s trying to HELP Sunny, but he’s doing it in a maladaptive way. >!He, along with headspace, are created to hide Sunny’s negative thoughts and the truth away. He’s “emotionless” because the last time Sunny experienced extreme emotion, he killed Mari. In the final battle, he says all of those things to Sunny because he believes that everybody will hate Sunny, and he wants to protect him by burying the truth away again.!<
i'd say omori is definetly a good embodiment of 'doing the wrong thing for the right reasons'
Thank you. So many people say that he's "evil" or that he's a different person from Sunny when he's just a part of him.
I was at first one of those people, although when I first played the game I was very emotional and didn’t think the clearest. But now I see that yeah, he’s part of Sunny. Not the “evil” part, but the “overprotective to a fault brother” part
It's kinda like Celeste, but more fucked up.
That implies OMORI was scared, which… hold on a minute… it kinda makes sense?
Plus, Omori was created by Sunny, and so the horrible things he says to Sunny are just Sunnys own self-loathing expressed through the projection Sunny has given up his agency to. It's also why I feel like the Foe Facts and stuff points to characterization for Sunny as well. Omori has become his own entity because he has much of Sunnys power due to Sunny repressing the truth, but them merging at the end I feel is a solid point toward the idea that Omori reflects aspects of Sunny himself, rather than being a fully discreet person all his own. He's a maladaptive coping mechanism that Sunnys lost control of, but he's just fulfilling his duty and expressing the very fears Sunny imbued him with that led him to hide the truth back at Sunny.
i dont think he is trying to be emotionless in fear of what hes done. the combat system portrays emotions in a very objective and logical way like a game, its not how emotions work, the way i see it its what sunny thinks emotions are and how they should work. my reading is that sunny feels so empty, and longs to be colourful and expressive and emotional, so he dreams it up.. . this is not supported by the fact that the emotion combat system is added late into development tho
im projecting myself into this a little bit, i think i get less feelings than other people do, its just harder to get emotional and i think thats kind of inhuman. like im missing out on an integral part of the human experience.. i think Sunny after the tragedy suppresses so much of his emotions he sees that suppressed state as himself, and acts accordingly.. its sad af to see omori being emotive in the release energy animation, he can see himself being happy/ or remember what its like hanging out with his friends but he can only do that in the battle system, if it follows his logic, if its distanced from his real self.. but thats just my headcanon lol
His intentions are good but are ultimately flawed and bad in practice
He's like a force of nature, you can't blame him, he's created to be like that. . . . . He's created to make Sunny feel happy... at all costs. He isn't done to feel shame for his own actions, he isn't done to live for himself, his purpose is only to protect Sunny, he is entirely selfless, he gains nothing from this, you can't really find him unlikeable because he's like a machine that only wants the best from Sunny, he just has false beliefs of how to find happiness. . All the times in which we see him hurting somebody, being evil, CLOSE, him sitting on the hands throne.... that was not him being cruel, that's just his nature as a coping system, that was what he belived it was right, that was his imput.. . . And to be fair that was a cool concept
No one here calls Omori cosmic evil, he is evil, because he does and wants evil things. Also, he doesn't want to protect Sunny at the end, he wants to >!kill him, because he refused him as well as seeing him as undeserving to life without him. He had no love for Sunny, he only wanted to control him and when he does, he wants to kill him, because Sunny cannot be his anymore. !<. . He actually loathes his creator and has little care for his friends...after all, if they fall out of line...>!death and banishment falls upon them as fate. If Sunny's friends ever met Omori and know who he is, they would all hate him, even Basil would only have few good words to say.  !<
Omori is literally just a manifestation of trauma trying to protect omori- that doesn’t make it good or bad. even with good intentions, self-protective tendencies can still be self-sabotaging
>!he helps sunny in the worst ways, he literally told sunny that he should just die!< 💀
But also when you give up to Omori, the bad end happens... So...
>!In that case, I interpret it as Omori transporting Sunny into a place where his friends will accept him and will care for him, which is headspace. I mean yeah, he does “kill” Sunny, but he believes that doing that will send Sunny to a place where people will love him and where he can be at peace. So… when I say maladaptive, I REALLY mean it haha!<
I love your take on it!! Thank you for sharing :)
Sunny similing is wholesome and warming. . so why does the exact same character with just a loss of color make it so much more cursed
1. He’s a personification of trauma and depression.. 2. As stated above, he’s a smug bitch.
eyebrows
Omori is literally sunnys self insert oc
Bro thinks he’s the protagonist of real life
I like the stories where everyone only starts to cool off after they've had a few months to think about it while Sunny is away. Bonus points if they manage to keep in contact with Sunny because seeing the crew split apart again is depressing.
A lot of times it seems to me that people dont really realize precisely that.. . Omori is not an inherently hostile outside force - at the end of the day, he's ljust a self-insert of Sunny.. . Everything Omori does is an expression of Sunnys will, conscious or not.. . Yet a lot of times he is depicted as an full-blown and flat villain, and that is something I believe to be completely undeserved.. . (Btw, I am specifically talking about Omori as a charcter, not as a person.)
I think people forget that Sunny himself created all of these characters. Even if they're metaphors and based on everything in real life, he still imagined them. Omori isn't a real person or entity, he's just apart of Sunny.
They're literally the same person.. . The things he say to Sunny in the final battle? That's Sunny's own thoughts about himself.
Except he isn't an embodiment of his self hatred. He, at his core, wants Sunny to be happy, and thinks that nobody knowing will make Sunny happy. He believes that if Sunny knows the truth he can't be happy so he gives up and changes his goal to simply precent Sunny from suffering.
Omori isn't even his own person, it's just a coping mechanism given form and made "cooler" because it's Sunny's avatar in headspace, (by "made cooler" I mean making him silent, edgy, smug when needed, etc., ).
omori’s your comfort character? who are you, sunny?
Yes I actually am sunny ty
Omori and Sunny are misunderstood AF, and it upsets me because I love them..
I agree. I am misunderstood. My Watpad Fanfic was not cringe, it was cool.
That's what they all say 👀...I assume, I'm not usually the guy to read a fanfic.
Omori is literally the personification of all the hatred and guilt Sunny feels for himself. He doesn't have much of a personality than the bare enough needed so he can actively make part of Sunny's fantasy. Omori is the way Sunny found to relive his memories without feeling disgusted and guilty at himself for what he done.. . But yeah fuck all that you just read from me Omori is a smug ass mf that will steal yo girl. . >!and possibly your boy too, but that's a story for another day!<
He is still pure evil...>!He wanted to kill Sunny and that is true evil!<.
I think there’s a confusion between omori and sunny.
He’s not emotionless he’s just reserved just like Sunny.
I think all of that annoying stuff is a red herring and intricate way of showing the real barriers Omori created to prevent sunny from fully reflecting and forgiving himself.
He could just be any other shy, quiet kid who doesn't talk much.. . But I guess he could be within the spectrum?? It really doesn't matter either way. This is literally just headcanons at this point.
I think there's a strong argument for it. The autism-coded traits, in isolation, don't mean anything, but looked at as a whole, there is a pattern.. . Just off the top of my head:. . - Selective mutism. Sunny's silence isn't just an RPG quirk. It is a core character trait. He was designed as a silent protagonist whose silence is a part of their personality. The dialogue/interactions in both the real world and flashbacks imply that Sunny communicates with a combination of speech, body language, and ASL. (There's is a flashback where Basil speaks *for* Sunny like an interpretor.). . . - Flat affect. Sunny doesn't express his emotions openly, despite how volatile they are. It's even a plot point bcs >!Sunny's poor communication and emotional regulation are partially what lead to the staircase fight.!< . . . . - Misophonia. Sunny has a strong, consistent dislike of loud noises that is unrelated to trauma. See: the Annoy/Megaphone abilities, the Airhorn, buzzing flies making Sunny Angry (that resembles the HS Enraged sprite), and the hair dryer + blender in >!Black Space 2!<. . . . - Food sensitivity. The Tofu description suggests texture issues ("slimy cardboard") while most of his favorite foods in Headspace are takeout or frozen meals (pizza, dino nuggets, Kraft-style mac n cheese, etc.). These are common "safe" foods for AS people bcs their taste and textures are relatively uniform and consistent.. . . . - His temper and emotional regulation. The emotion system heavily-implies that Sunny struggles to regulate strong emotions (esp. anger), while the story implies that Sunny also struggles to properly recognize and communicate these emotions, leading to destructive outbursts. >!This is one of the reasons Omori exists, to neutralize and vent Sunny's volatile emotions. Hence, the tier-3 emotions.!< A non-plot-related example is the fly-swatting  mini-game, where flies buzzing in his ear make Sunny angry to the point of accidentally smacking himself.. . . . - Repetition and reluctance to change. Sunny relies on other people to introduce him to new hobbies and experiences. He will not step out of his comfort zone unless prodded repeatedly (Basil waiting for weeks/months for Sunny to read a recommended book, >!Mari's "Expand your mind!" dialogue in Black Space.!<.). . . . - Hyperfixation. Sunny has a vast library of obscure and intensely-detailed facts that your average NT wouldn't think twice about. For example, he has memorized the exact nutritional value of celery, including the net-negative calories. The sprout mole chefs imply that Sunny hyperfixates on topics associated with his friends to bond with them, even if it's something he personally hates.
although one can also explain these symptoms in many other ways. . . first of all he has been through the worst trauma of his lifetime, stuff like that would absolutely trigger selective mutism, flat affect, inflexibility and OCD symptoms. . . secondly, i’ve had majority of these points without being autistic, it’s just a mix of my personality and some anxiety. i had agoraphobia as a child which made me mute and unable to express myself for example, on top of that i experienced physical abuse which made me very repetitive, irritable, sensitive and withdrawn
Most of these traits aren't the result of trauma. Sunny was like this before the incident. You can see it in the scrapbook + their captions, in Headspace (which is "frozen" before the trauma), and in flashbacks. All the trauma did was *intensify* them, but they are core features of his character.. . Again, selective mutism is a common symptom of autism. Sunny is implied to use ASL or other means of communication in addition to limited speech, despite not being HoH or physically mute.. . He doesn't have OCD symptoms, not in the colloquial or medical sense. The repetitive and restrictive behavior Sunny exhibits (*before* the trauma) is related to interests/hobbies and food sensitivity, not intrusive thoughts or orderliness. (HS Mari tells us that Sunny was a messy kid.). . Sunny only becomes agoraphobic after the incident. He has *alway* been shy and reluctant to open up, it just got *worse* afterwards.. . I don't get why people dislike the idea that Sunny might be autistic. There's nothing wrong with being autistic or ND. It's very consistent with his overall character, his backstory, and the narrative conflict.. . Even if it's only coding/implication, Sunny is one of the best examples I've seen of autism that doesn't fit the "quirky-but-tolerable" Aspergers mold.
Sorry, can you elaborate more on the ASL/selective mute front? I know he doesn’t speak much, but I didn’t realize he could be using sign language?
The Rainy Day flashback, there's an odd line where Basil speaks on Sunny's behalf, like an interpretor ("Hey guys, Sunny says..."). To me, this sounds like he's using sign language or something other means of communication.. . In retrospect, I realize it's not the best evidence, but that's how I interpreted it, at least. Kel says Sunny used to speak *more* before the incident, but speaking more doesn't necessarily mean he was full vocal. Sunny only has 2 lines of *spoken* dialogue in the game; he can speak but he prefers not to. His silence is a core character trait.. . edit:there's also the thumbs up gesture Omori gives Aubrey during their follow-up move, in the context that silence is part of Sunny/Omori's character. and Omori representing a 12-year-old Sunny.
This is a great summary, especially pointing out that Sunny's angry portrait looks more like enraged Omori.. . In my opinion this game leaves a lot of clues and hints that will go over heads of people who do not have the necessary experience to pick up on them - e.g. how many people miss clear signs that Kel and Hero's mother is a narcissist with Hero being the golden child and Kel being the scapegoat.. . But another clear sign of Sunny being autistic is the buried in the sand picture. Deep pressure is something that is used in therapy for autistic people and things like weighted blankets are commonly used.
This is a very comprehensive list!. . I’ve always been keen on the possibility of Sunny being autism-coded, and the fact that so many of those traits are also ones I share makes him relatable, too.
Ngl even though I’m in this sub I haven’t touched the game in like over a year. Do you have a link to the flashback? And also for sunny waiting that long to read a book?
Oh I see, some of his tendencies just reminded me of my own younger brother(who’s on the spectrum)
Does he and you play an instrument by any chance?
CHILL- 😭. . We live in a one story house tho soo..
he gon push you down a hill then
And prepare for the >!tree with the rope!<
And the friend with >!the camera!<
Sunny just reminds me of myself, who is autistic
Same!
same (in some aspects)
do you also have a sister? /jk
sunny has selective mutism, which some autistic kids have
Yooooo nice pfp
As a shy quiet kid (I have selective mutism) I need to say I’m not autistic! And it pisses me off when people immediately assume I am lol
Yeah, I think this is quite right, I'm a really shy guy and at many moments, he just resembles the younger me in a really strange, sad and, at the same time, recomforting way.. . I have never been diagnosed with anything as autism, but I can see what you mean by that, I agree he could be within the spectrum, but wouldn't be surprised if he isn't.. . (Sorry if I've commited any grammar mistakes, english is not my main language)
Autistic coded could also mean they have some of the traits but not canonically have it
They only sane reply to this type of question. Thank you for not making me think every person in any indie game’s subreddit is delusional
Yes
I guess I'm autistic then??. . I've never been professionally diagnosed, nor am i an expert, but I doubt that every single person who is shy and quiet is autistic. I know there's a spectrum and all, but surely that isn't a universal trait exclusive to autism?
You should really check it out then. Or at least think about it.
Damn, I could not imagine waiting that long and having it suddenly dropped, that must have been awkward. I’d known my entire life luckily
Oh damn... Guess my diagnosed social anxiety was actually autism then 🫠. . Mind you that I was a very rambunctious and socially active kid in middle school, and then when my family moved to the city in 6th grade, is when I got social anxiety
Except social anxiety and autism are actually kinda similar, while broken ribs in comparisin to chest pain is... an actual injury lmao
Most shy quiet kids are in fact autistic
if rating every neghbour's bed is autistic.... so why not?
He's basically this. . 
I need a hat like this ngl. Who's the character?
That’s the VTuber Saruei
Thanks
Where can I get this hat.
Me fr
that hat is so me fr
Maybe. All the situations sunny gets put into result in things which are explainable by PTSD or Depression, both of which Sunny definitely has.. That is to say it's hard to say he is when symptoms of his existing mental illnesses overlap with autism.. Although, ranking beds is pretty autistic. You could also make the case that Sunny keeping track and doing the math so quickly in his head for every Headspace fight is autistic-coded too.
I take the spicy approach of, he might be autistic, but he's far more characteristic of "schizoid personality disorder", and a lot of what people attribute to ASD is actually better described as SzPD.. . The classic symptoms of Schizoid Personality Disorder are:. . - Extreme withdrawal. Being a "hermit" is the telltale sign. The hikikomori phenomenon of Japan is often looked at as SzPD, and is the namesake of Omori.. . - Living in a fantasy world, replacing real world needs with fantastic substitutes, for example replacing physical friendships with imaginary ones, replacing actual career progress with imaginary ones. Their fantasies often have a somewhat grandiose tone.. . - Excessive sleeping. As part of the fantasy escape, SzPD sufferers often spend a long time in bed fantasizing and/or sleeping.. . - Flattened affect. Basically strongly inhibited emotional expression and a loss of joy from things in the real world. They can also come across as emotionally muted and cold to others.. . - Stilted speech, which basically means "doesn't talk a lot". They're notably quiet and off on the side.. . - Low body weight due to lack of self-care and food-related anhedonia.. . - Apparent asexuality. Will usually prefer masturbation to actual sexual contact, and ideate over being secretly wanted without having to risk vulnerability.. . - Dissociation. Spending so much time detached in schizoid fantasy causes prominent experiences of depersonalisation and derealisation, sometimes accompanied by transient hallucinations (though not to the point of major psychotic disorders).. . - Avoidant attachment. SzPD sufferers on a deep level yearn for acceptance, but think they will be rejected and scorned for opening up, and fear emotional intimacy more broadly. They will often have a "confidant", a single someone else who is trusted and held much closer.. . PTSD and Depression definitely get thrown into the mix post-stairs, but his preexisting personality organisation fits that of Schizoid Personality Disorder better than Autism imo, though I'm not a chartered psychiatrist so take it for what it is.
Either this needs to stop listing every single one of my personality traits or i need to go to the doctor
"Will usually prefer masturbation to actual sexual contact". . i dont think thats a choice for them
There's also stuff like his selective mutism, flat affect,  and emotional regulation issues. These existed long before the trauma and even play a part in the story conflict.
It's basically a 50/50. . 

As someone on the spectrum I’d say maybe, I do see some autism traits in him but I wouldn’t speculate about him being autistic coded since a lot of his behaviors and traits are a result of heavy trauma. I think that explains them better that him possibly being autistic. It’s just hard to tell
A lot of Sunny's autistic-coded traits existed before the trauma. His flat affect and emotional regulation/communication issues are even important plot points.
I dont think so, hes just a little shy and closed off, thats it
I always thought he was, but it's only a headcanon, if you think he's just shy there's nothing exactly wrong about that
Uhhhh not sure, not a doctor in that field lol.. Ya might think his certain behaviors might be what warrant an appointment buuut can't say.. . The sand buried face is such a mood tho.
i dont really see him as autistic  . sunny's a lil quiet that's all
I mean, I don’t really believe so, but if you want to, be my guest
Okay, so you know that one scene in spider-verse where Peter and Miles meet for the first time, and Peter’s spider-sense goes off, and he says “you’re like me…”?. . Peter is me and the spider-sense is autism
I'm autistic myself, and if this kid isn't autistic too I'll eat my hat. Just look at him hiding in the gift box on his birthday, his super literal sense of humor (wormhole, get it?), his lack of social grace, his tendency to completely dissociate and retreat into daydreams when the world around him is too much to deal with... I could go on. It's one of the clearest depictions of autism, or at least my experience with it, that doesn't involve just telling you outright that "hey by the way this kid is autistic."
Intentionally written as such? Probably not.. . In my headcanons? Yes
In lore? We have no idea, but i would assume that if he was, it would be mentioned. Not to say he isn't though, because it's not like autism was ever brought up in game. So there was never a time for someone to say "oh yeah, speaking of autism, sunny, aren't you on the spectrum?". 50/50 chance basically . . I'm headcannon? He can be a dragon, it doesn't really matter, so sure.  If you want him to be autistic, he is
Some of the behaviour Sunny makes remind me of myself. And I'm autistic, so it's possible he's autistic too
not really
shyness and introversion ≠ autism . . a person can be closed off and lone wolf without having a diagnosis
He just seems like very introverted introvert type guy
Schrodinger's autism
I think trauma responses can sometimes be similar to autistic tendencies, that being said, sunny was acting that way long before the incident with Mari so I think there’s a chance he might be somewhere on the spectrum
Nah my lil bro isn't on the spectrum
Are you?
No
Yeah he reminds me of my brother and my brother is autistic so probably
I feel like he's definitely neuro-divergent but I'm not sure if I'd headcanon him being autistic? Just personally idk
probably
idk if he was designed that way, but as an autistic person i resonate with him very much
yeah 100% as someone with autism. not just him being shy, but also him rating beds, never smiling (even says somewhere that this has been the same since his birth) and dreaming a lot
I'm hugely biased. But I'd say [yes. ]()
I think so
no!
Why do people on Reddit keep trying to call every character in every fandom autistic? (“Every” being hyperbole, of course) . . Shy people exist, socially awkward people exist, people who do weird shit for no reason exist. (I fall into that last category) I feel like trying to label all these people autistic for no better reason is reductive, especially when it comes to characters. They wouldn’t be popular without these characteristics, otherwise the author would be writing a boring character. Are boring people  and boring characters the only non-autistic people then?
That was not what I was implying(especially on the last part). . I only asked because some of Sunny’s tendencies reminded me of my younger brother(who’s on the spectrum)
No one was implying that. Autistic headcanons bring comfort to us ND people. You clearly aren't ND if you haven't realized that, stop making so many assumptions
100% yes.
Hell yeah I amt5\31hpy:2474
I think he might be on the spectrum, while we never get any big signs from him, what sells it for me is the Real world Recycultist section which is implied to be a daydream, And I've found myself doing the same on occasion.. . So yeah, I wouldn't be against suntism
SUNTISM I LOVE IT (just like me fr)
Yes he is because I said so /hj
Potentially, but I'd say it's more of a headcannon than purposeful coding
As an autistic, yes
Oh… he just like me… HE JUST LIKE ME FR!!!!
It’s really up to you. To me, he’s not; he’s just quiet and introverted. . But I can see how others say he could be on the spectrum.
i mean im autistic and i used to act like him without the trauma when i was younger so idk maybe
As an autistic person yeah it’s not out of the question
is he not already?
probally yes
I haven't been diagnosed with autism but I don't...sometimes I can't speak depending on what's going on. Sometimes it's transitional, like the process of waking up and being awake. I can only really grunt or hum but I can't speak for awhile. It could last a couple of minutes, or it could last hours. Forcing myself to speak drains me if I do it before I'm ready.  It also happens if I'm extremely upset or distressed. Now I will say, I have two little brothers who are AuDHD so there is a high possibility that I am too so *shrugs*  take it with a grain of salt I guess. I like the idea of Sunny being autistic though.
Well yes, but actually yes
He’s def anti-social, but I don’t know enough to say autistic or not. I think he’s supposed to be coded as highly closed off and that’s it.
last pic is cutie
Imma be honest, I have always seen him as an autistic boy, I am autistic, and basically we are a copy of each other, but, all autistic people are different, and Sunny is pretty much the stereotype of what an autistic shy boy would look like
He’s a lot like me I think and I’m autistic so I will say yes, but there’s no canon answer so anyone can say
I think he fits but I don't know if OMOCAT specifically designed Sunny as autistic
Yeah I think so at least
Yes
he just like me fr
I think he’s autistic simply because I’m autistic and I relate to him heavily, he also has a lot of traits and there’s nothing wrong with Head-cannoning him as autistic bc doesn’t change the story it just adds rep I think he is so he is. (If you think he’s not then he’s not simple as that)
imo as an autistic person, yeah. Also could be something else, but I’d say autism is a good possibility‼️‼️
I don’t even see a question in this for me.. He’s totally autistic coded imo, intentionally or unintentionally. (I’m autistic)
As someone autistic, kinda. But it's hard to say, it could be just trauma. We don't know much about Sunny before the incident. Maybe he was just shy and quiet and he became mute by being traumatized and also to not forget his sister. I honestly don't think he is *that* autistic.
I am autistic and he is literally me, so yes he is.
No he's just introverted and shy
As someone who's autistic . I think so, I relate to a lot of his mannerisms in the games art
People who know nothing about autism need to lay off these comments for real omg
Autistic ***-*** coded ***-***
it can explain why sunny was very angry against mari
No sunny is not a robot coded to act autistic, i thought we already talked about this.
schizoid, maybe.
I'm kinda autistic already, and i could say i relate so much with his behaviour. My emotions are uncontrollable, sometimes i did something that i will regret, whether it's important or just straight up embarassing, i really have so much trouble in communicating, i don't express myself much. But idk im more hyperactive as an autism person, and autism affects people differently. But yeah, Sunny got some signs of it, i already knew it on "One day left."
To me, he’s definitely autistic and selective mute
yeah
Literally me
Coded? To me it feels explicit
As someone who has autism, I have no idea. He has shown a few traits of it but they don’t really seem to be an intentional match to me. . . Maybe I’m missing something and it’s intentional, but I just kinda doubt it.
I’d say there ain’t a mfer in the crew who isn’t neurodivergent but at the same time that’s headcanon so
Who the fuck starts a post like that I just opened reddits minutes ago?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Yeah)
autistic? maybe.. . autistic coded? yes.
why are Sunny's hands so hulkishly huge and detailed in the 3rd pic
It’s because if the gloves lol 😂
I think he might have sone traits but he's more of the shy, quiet kid in school then autistic
Autism varies strongly from Person to person, i myself have it and have met others who are effected totally different then i am, theres a possibility but i cant say for certain ¯⁠\⁠⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠⁠/⁠¯
Not every introverted person is fucking autistic, jesus christ.
No one was saying that ...
He literally me fr... E-except for the killing my sister and falling into a deep depression part.
stuttering over text is actually insane
what's your problem?? it's just shorthand for hesitance, chill
I sure hope so, it would make him so much more relatable
Anecdotally, I'm autistic and strongly identify with Sunny's overall demeanor
as somebody who is autistic, i say it takes one to know one. and damn that boy's got the tism.
he is maybe the most autistic coded character yet
I think he could be interpreted that way but I also think he could just qs easily be interpreted as someone whose just shy and closed off. I wouldn't say I acted like sunny as a kid (I acted more like basil) but I have friends who were like him who aren't autistic, they were just closed off and shy. however I think its totally fine to interpret him thay way!! it's really up to whatever
No he's just a cutie
I realize you probably didn't mean this but it sounds like you're saying him being cute means he isn't autistic,,, but maybe I've been scrolling through rude comments on here for too long
Probably idk
I think whatever Sunny is, it causes symptoms to autism, but I think it's a bit deeper than that. This isn't saying he ISN'T on the spectrum, but I think there were other mental disorders Omocat might have had in mind when writing Sunny and how he acts
As an autistic person I don't think sunny is autistic. But I think he could have some other disorder, or he's just shy and traumatized lol
🧐
Nah, he's me coded fr
I personally headcanon him as being mute/nonverbal
No.
No, even though i would like him to be i don't think hes autistic, hes just shy and keeps to himself
He’s murder coded
nah but he deffo short
No, he's cat coded! (He really gives me cat vibes)
I get what you mean but a lot of autistic people (including myself) relate to cats wayyy more than most people do lol
That's real (I got autism too)
probably not
Honestly,as an austistic person,i can see it.
He's just like me fr fr
Very
He is autistic bc i am autistic and i said so
very
100% yes he is
Or he's just a kid and y'all reflect on omori chars way too much
weird comment my guy, this game was literally made to be reflected on lol
totally
no character is autistic coded. it's fanon if you perceive them as such.
Even if it's not always intentional, there are certain behaviours that imply certain things abour a character, even if they're not explicitly stated. Like how Mettaton from UnderTale is trans-coded, as an example. Nobody every explicitly references gender, people just talk about the body and presentation, but his experiences reflect that of trans people.. . . Same thing here, neurodivergence is not brought up in-game at any point, but a lot of Sunny's behaviours, his thought processes, and the responses he has to stressful stimuli could be coding.
mettaton is different though. you can use intentional context clues from his past diaries and the fact that ghosts canonically use they/them, which mettaton no longer uses.
That counts as trans coded my friend
ok??????
he's autistic without the code
Not autism, but definitely on the spectrum.
>! he's serial killer coded !<
How are any of these images related lol
I wanted to add photos of him geez 😭
I’m not angry??? Its just that none of these really provide much of a basis for your question
>!she is a figment of Sunny’s imagination, as well as a donut, so I don’t think she even has a spine!<
&#x200B;. . 

technically she's not entirely from mine, she's based off a character I saw once and thought was... interesting. But yeah I don't think I thought that far into how it worked haha
This guy listens to Fireflies by Neon Cities before he goes to sleep 💀
Omori makes a hole in his chest too when the door is missing, damn even Sunny's dream women are unrealistic impossible portrayals he's just like me fr fr
Bold of you to assume Sunny even thought about this in the first place when creating her character
Maybe Sunny should use her as a circus act and get small dogs to jump through her for clams
Sunny, please, it's just a drawing 
jokes on you. i can just go to sleep and have it my way there 
Omg that's so cute 😭. Sunny just fell asleep there
i love how sunny is in front of omori instead of the other way like the other characters and their hs counterparts.. . really shows how sunny’s dynamic with omori is
It gets more messed up the more you look at it. But it also shows how Sunny may be in control of headspace.
I'm surprised that there is actually fanart of sunny with no eyepatch post good-ending.
: sunny why can't you just walk like a normal person. . *(but girl)*: faster peasant
My favourite's probably the one of Basil reading to Sunny. The expression Sunny has really makes it my favourite!. . Tied second place goes to >!literally every single frame of art that shows during the Duet. They're all soooo good.!<. . EDIT: How could I forget buried Sunny!? Definitely my third favourite.
. . The way it captures Sunny's mental torment
i love in all photos sunny is just. :o
If OMORi and dream gang get isekaid to genshin that means that sunny mind is strong enough to rewrite reality. (Also Sunny is now missing in faraway town oof). . If Genshin cast get isekaid to headspace that means OMORI is going to have to do some cleaning aka kicking them out from headscape.
The unnamed god is Omori and his  red hands
I dont think genshin cast can beat OMORI in his own realm. Feats and Magic dont matter since all of this is inside Sunny's head
Well considering in the game it’s said that Headspace existed before Sunny, that would mean that it could just be the area of Headspace that’s under Sunny’s control which is where Omori’s abilities reaches their peak.. . Though that does bring up the question: is Headspace limited to Faraway, or is there an entire alternate dreamspace for the whole planet? If there were aliens that shared our intelligence, would that make Earth’s Headspace linked with theirs? What would an alien’s Headspace even look like?
Omori just gets addicted to phone games, and especially genshin, and then accidentally summons them in the dreamworld
Omori commits ethnic cleansing
Sunny is my favourite Anemo character
sunny: >!this is why i pushed you down the stairs!<
Could it be related to Black space starting to seep through? I was just thinking about this yesterday and I think there's kind of a parallel to >!the room with the hospital beds (when Sunny is about to find out the truth piece by piece) and one bed saying "This person is not breathing".!<
I'm late to the party but I agree. "It is not alive." is used elsewhere in the game typically referencing past cycles and/or blackspace. Imo this line is the very distant voice at the back of Sunni's head reminding him that all the characters here aren't real - aren't alive. More of Blackspace and the truth seeping through.
Sunny had minor brain damage
Lmao I just reflexively hit upvote once I saw Kamala as Sunny’s mom
Was going on guys Sunny back again
When I saw Sunny’s mom I was like “ok, sure” then I saw the rest of the female actors.
>!I always thought that Basil was struggling to cope with his Grandma's illness because he knew she wasn't going to make it. He gave Sunny the Photo Album because he trusted Sunny as someone that would keep the memories safe and because he was the only one to share their secret with. Basil intended to kill himself, fueled by his Grandma's inevitable passing. Sunny would have inherited the Photo Album, if it had gone to plan. When he heard the news that he was moving away, he ran to the bathroom, crying at the realisation that the memories he captured in his photos would never be shared with the living members of the group again. Soon after, he swears to himself that he will at least wait until after Sunny moves. The guilty visions they see are a product of failing to remove the thoughts and his desires sparking up with the fear of being unable to keep his promise to himself. But he wanted to stay alive for Sunny. His ill Grandma didn't help that.!<. . . That's just what I imagine happened. His Grandma plays the role of excuse, only adding to the list of things he failed to deal with.
Grandma: I know what you did Sunny.. . Sunny: \*unplugs life support*
Oh God...
>!’SUNNY… Pk fire…’!<
She would tell Sunny the paradise that would come if he embraced the three fingers, singed his flesh, and burnt the Erdtree to the ground
She'd probably say something like: "I already know." after sunny tells her what's bothering him or something
she drop kicks sunny down the stairs in the bad ending
It was supposed to be more "innocent" looking. Atleast for HS anyway because its Sunny's dreamland and form of escape where everything is okay and everyone is happy :)
Isnt omori around 12? I mean omori isnt real but isn’t he a representation of sunny when he was around 12 ?
Still tho ? He’s still a child
To be honest that sounds way too short in my opinion but a question i have is: will omori and sunny talk? Or will they stay quiet?
Hopefully we can get some scenes not featuring Sunny at all.
the bad one so i can see sunny dying in 4k
>!That or sunny described something very well!<
>!Nah,clearly ARTIST is the unseen 3rd accomplice to the entire TRUTH sequence.!<
ARTIST is the player
Carmina Mora exists in the OMORI universe confirmed?
why does that poster look like a horror game with sunny as the protag or antag?
I mean, is he not?
true, he *is* the actual protag sooo-. . but i also get the feelings he might be an antag for some reason.
I know but I refrained because it might be spoiler territory. You know, the Man vs $***.
ohhh-. . wait what? sorry am im just dumb idk what ur talking about ;-;
>!man vs self, the conflict style!<
ohh i remember now!. . now i understand lol
That's exactly what it is
ohh ok
>!The real reason why Sunny created his own headspace!<
real answer: orange doesn't fit with the color palette of this area, at all. . realer answer: sunny's perfect world does not have orange joe in it.
The entirety of ORANGE oasis:
if you mean the color palette part, that's why I said "this area" haha, orange does not work for vast forest
The Orange Joe and Oragne Joe NPCs:

i meant the drink i meant the drink i meant the drink 
AWWWHHHH THAT'S MY FIRST TIME EVER SEEING A REDDIT "EMOJI" THAT'S SO CUTE AAAA 
Orange Joe the drink is made out of Orange Joe the character 
it’s just viscerally disgusting to sunny apparently
To be fair orange and coffee does sound nasty.
I've had it before. It's not as awful as I thought it would be.
Drink half a litre of it and you're done for
It tastes like sweet vomit

We hate Orange Joe 💪💪💪
I think it was a symbolism in Sunny’s mind. Sunny knows how much Kel loves orange joe and, naturally, now orange joe reminds him of Kel. This is something I used to do a lot as a memory practice for my friends. (Ex. Someone you know likes the color blue and it’s the biggest thing that sticks out to you when you think of them, you associate them to the color and when they leave, now blue reminds you of them and makes you sad) seeing as how headspace is Sunny’s way of escaping reality and his memories, this is my most reasonable theory. the other is that the color orange just didn’t fit the color scheme of the park and since this is the beginning of the game where your introduced to these pictures and the memories attached to them follow later in the game, the appeal in a game is important. If they introduced the photo book in orange oasis then it would probably be orange joe rather than milk, but that’s just my backup theory
I Hope i didnt put any spoilers in there, idk how to spoil text-
Sunny had to avoid any possible lawsuits, even in headspace
Orange Joe is >!an actual character in Headspace with a side-quest tied to him. Having him as both a character and an item would be confusing, so maybe Sunny's subconscious "corrected" it by removing the reference to Orange Joe as a drink for the sake of using Orange Joe as a character.!<
I thought it was just to show that Sunny was misremembering the details of his time with his friends since many years had gone by
~~It's because Sunny believes in Chinese censorship~~
I thought it was because sunny's memory was unreliable. In the real world version of the picture he's drinking orange joe in the exact same way as him drinking milk.
If there was orange joe then it would remind sunny about it-
orange joe nearly made me vomit so I'm not surprised Sunny repressed it
To me the sequence where you see the real photos and how they’re different from headspace photos was a thing where the game was trying to convey that Sunny’s memory was flawed. That he had forgotten, repressed or misremembered so much that the details had slipped.
In ONE OF THE ROUTES, Sunny i think said something about not liking it. Could be wrong
Sunny just loathed the brand and eradicated it from his head
Me calling sunny waltuh in my first game:
Waltuh, You need to move on waltuh
Buhsil, put your d away Buhsil
I'm not dealun wuth ya trauma rait now Buhsil
>!"waltuh... There's no way out of this, is there? Tell me, waltuh... Am I selfish for doing this?" !<
Waltuh...put your depression away waltuh
I named him sans, regretted that so much lol
It helps the player to insert themselves into the game and connect with Sunny more but it would definitely ruin the experience when they name him some dumb shit
i have a friend who did a blind play through, but went with the name “frisk” for the memes. now she doesnt know who sunny is.
Pain
leave frisk alone theyve gone through enough shit already
This lives in my head rent free, now I just imagine Omori going against Sans
holy shit same i went with FRISK as well lol but i dont think it detracted from the experience at all
I kept it as Sunny because I’d like to see the game as “telling a story” . . I think the custom name would ruin the story and break the immersion in dialogue kind of lol
I think in order for custom names to work it needs to be a normal human male name as we are playing through a boys eyes
i named him qwerty on my first (blind) playthrough and then on my second playthrough i named him fartmaster
Good to know i'm not the only one who tries to name nameable characters fartmaster
FUCK YEA
When I was a kid, everyone named their characters *I Farted*.
"Hey, *I Farted!* How are you?" ***insert generic dialogue here***
When I first was getting into the OMORI fandom, I kept seeing the name Sunny and got so confused who it was lol. I do agree though, i felt more connected to the game putting name in
It actually deepens the immersion.. . Any real sister would say >!"I forgive you, fuckwad."!<
i kept the name Sunny in the first playthrough, but i named him Omocat in the second playthrough to get the sweet achievement... and also coupon code for her shop lol
They took the achievement off xbox and I didn't know so I named sunny omocat and was disappointed to find that they took it off lmao (wasn't my first play through but still k wanted that achievement)
I didn't want to put my name in because by the time you get to name him it's obvious Sunny is his own character. But I thought Sunny was a randomly generated girls name so I changed it lol.
If someone’s first thought is to name the main character a childish meme, then that person never planned on taking the game seriously to begin with and would have ruined their experience anyway
Its really not that serious
[Yknow what else isn’t that serious?]()
NOOO
I love you/p. ALSO I AM SO UPSET THAT I COULD MENTALLY HEAR THE IMAGE
It’s not a Rick roll at least
[this guy is also not]()  . . .   . >!pls pls pls don't im so sorry but its true!<
From a game design standpoint, it absolutely is that serious.  This doesn't affect us at all, as people who have already finished the game and clearly enjoyed it, but this subreddit is disproportionate of the amount of people who. . - played the game naming their character "poopface". . - subsequently skipped much of the dialogue (it's just a silly game, the lore probably doesn't matter). . - didn't enjoy any of the "real world" sections of the game (where did the gameplay go?  I don't care for this lore). . - didn't enjoy the final section of the game where there's no "gameplay" for a few hours.. . This is again not our problem, and we don't have the right to tell someone they're playing the game wrong, but if the developer of a game wants players to play a certain way or have a certain experience, all of the little things do add up.  Removing the name feature doesn't 100% solve the problem but it could deter at least a small minority of players.
I've seen more people say they love the realworld sections and don't like the headspace ones instead of vice versa.
I'm not sure that you have.  I think it's more accurate to say you've seen more of this on Reddit, or on discord, or in Omori-centric communities.. . The true playerbase of a game is always vastly different from the fan base of the game.  There could be a number of reasons someone dislikes the game, but you'd never know by sticking around in communities dedicated to the game, because someone who dislikes it wouldn't be here.. . That said, it's probably true that people who enjoyed the game enjoy the real world sections more because it's where the majority of the *literal* plot happens as opposed to the metaphorical plot.
no i took the game 100000% seriously i just suck at coming up with names on the spot (this is a complete and blatant lie) (( i did not take the game seriously until blackspace))
AAAAA
and since you may not know dark it is you might name him (my butt)
It has nothing to do with "inserting themselves into the game" thats just a phrase. Its a story more than a game. They just use game to tell this story. Doing so defeats the whole purpose of this story, of any story if you ask me. You don't name the main character yourself when reading a book

Fear me muahahahahaha
Instead, I'm praising you
To be fair, I'd guess if they named them dumb shit, they weren't really looking for that kind of experience.
While I don't necessarily disagree, I think there are a few valid reasons for why it was implemented:. . - To solidify the fact that Sunny, not Omori, is the true protagonist of the story.. - As a callback to the classic RPGs that *OMORI* takes inspiration from. Back in the day, a lot of games allowed characters to be renamed, even those that weren't meant to be blank slates. Examples include *Breath of Fire*, *EarthBound* and I believe *Chrono Trigger* as well.. . . Also, the game does have a built-in filter to block "silly" names, and while it isn't perfect, it does help prevent mood whiplash during more serious scenes. It also won't let you give Sunny the names of other characters (Basil, Kel, Aubrey, etc.).
I mean me and my friend literally named him “1+1=2” at his house once so the filter isn’t that great
The filter doesn't really account for those kinds of names. You can't name Sunny "hoe", for instance.
Can we name him Umb?
WHY NOT
I- I don-.. why! 
No don’t worry we had both already played through the whole thing
Oh thank goodness
If it really wanted to pay homage to the games it was inspired by, the name filter shouldnt be there. It's just not the same if I can't name my character "shitnugget"
To be fair, even without the filter, I'm pretty sure that "shitnugget" exceeds the maximum length.
The filter, as I found out, does not know what British slang is. So calling sunny a slag doesn’t get censored. I truly don’t remember the first thing I called him, it wasn’t slag I just wanted to check. I think it was like walter or something because one of my friends at the time liked breaking bad.
I called him Charon my first playthrough and got really used to it. Sunny feels so weird to me because there is nothing sunny about this guy.
I just gave him my name because I didn't know what I was doing
I called him Stinky in my 2nd playthrough just for the memes. Big regret. Day cake happy
Sunny being able to be named, in my opinion, is not a big deal and helps the player immerse themselves in the game. While it may be them to the player, Sunny is still known to the community. Being nameable is therefore just a fun feature and has no negative effects. Sunny's nameability is acceptable, despite the fact that some people call him very stupid sh*t. I think we should just enjoy the beauty of omori instead of focusing on stuff like this.. . Edit: did not know I replied to someone about this I'm so sorry 😦
Acknowledging stuff like this is part of enjoying the games beauty though. Outside of its story, its still a game that, despite its (imo) subpar fight mechanics, still does really cool stuff with its gameplay like blackspace and some scripted fights
I was lowkey confused, but it’s alright bro 
Genuinely so sorry man😭😭 I'm glad we have came to a peaceful solution instead of fighting![gif](emote|freeemotespack|slightlysmiling) hope your having a good day or night!
We all make mistakes, you have a good day too!
you should only be able to have two possible names: sunny and snuuy 
That's what i named him on my second run
Agreed. I'm glad Morpheus kept sunny's name in his playthrough. . also one time i saw someone call sunny omori  (maybe it was just to see what changes if you name it that)
I don't understand, Sunny is not a self-insert of any kind why would the name of the file name is the same as what you name him
I think I would say that Sunny actually is a self insert of some kind. Not the kind that you project your own personality onto, but the kind where you imagine yourself as if you are him and are living his life, essentially.. . Think of it like this. If you name him after yourself then it allows you to have an easier time putting yourself in his shoes. You don’t feel like a passive observer watching him go through the motions, you feel like you *are* him.. . This causes you to associate his actions with your own. So, later on when you reach the part of the game where >!it’s revealed that Sunny killed Mari. You don’t feel like you watched someone else kill her, you feel like *you* killed her.!<. . >!Instead of thinking “Oh God, how could Sunny do this. He’s a terrible person” you think “Oh God, how could I do this? I’m a terrible person” which I think is perfect, because then you’re thinking about yourself exactly what Sunny would be thinking about himself during this scene!<
>!I would have to disagree with that basis because most people disassociate themselves from him as the truth gets unfolded.!< . . >!I do understand the perspective of Bais that we do gain but overall it feels more like a narrator as many times he acts upon his own accord. Like the good end when it cuts off after "I have to tell you something" we want to hear what Sunny wants to say and because of that open ending we wouldn't know as only Sunny has a definite answer. Same with what's next after a neutral ending!<. . >!I would also rebuttal that if that were the case we still wouldn't need to name him, if it were the case why isn't the same applied with omori after all that are an extension of Sunny it should only be fair.!<
>!I would say that dissociating yourself from Sunny during the truth is fine for this too. Sunny is also dissociating from himself as it's being revealed, as he's viewing himself from an outside perspective rather than through his own eyes and has a hard time accepting that what he's seeing is something he really did. So you're still feeling the same thing as Sunny if you dissociate!<. . >!I'm not entirely sure what you mean by your second point. We know exactly what Sunny is going to say in the true ending, he's going to tell them the truth. We don't hear exactly how he tells it because it's an open ending, but we're given enough clues throughout the game to discern how the ending went.!<. >!We don't get to see what happens next after the neutral ending because the game has to end at some point!<. . >!We don't *need* to name him. But naming him helps establish in your head that you and Sunny are one in the same. He's not a separate person you're observing from afar. You *are* him, and anything that refers to him will feel more personal to you because of this.!<. . >!I would be fine with Omori being nameable as well. But I believe the same isn't applied to Omori for a few reasons.!< . . >!The first reason is because when Sunny becomes Omori, he is dissociating. He believes he is a different person and not himself. A similar thing would apply to you here. If you can't name Omori, he feels less personal to you. So you dissociate him from yourself and see him as a different person!<. . >!The second reason is that a lot of people would probably give both Omori and Sunny the same name, which would defeat the purpose of Omori's character!<. . >!And the third reason is that there's actually an in-universe reason why Omori is named that. And while you could just change the name on Mari's piano to whatever you named Omori, it would be really weird to have a piano named "George"!<
I think the letters should be all capitalized since I named him "Sunny" not "SUNNY"
yes. now half the fanbase doesn’t fucking know who sunny is
Sunny should absolutely be namable because who cares what his name is?
: LIGMA! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME
shoutout to the streamer who named sunny "MRBEAST", it ruined any sort of tension.
I mean, it works for most games but on Omori it's just- idk I felt like since it is a depiction of Sunny's traumas it should be played through Sunny's POV (and thus with his original name) and not the players if that makes sense (⁠.⁠ ⁠❛⁠ ⁠ᴗ⁠ ⁠❛⁠.⁠)
There is two main reasons why people don't like it,. . 1. Sunny isn't really a blank slate character.. 2. People sometimes name him "Deez" or something along the lines of that. And then it is really weird later on, such as >!"Why does this keep happening to us, Deez?"!< or >!"I love you, Deez."!<
>	1.	Sunny isn’t really a blank slate character.. . Neither are ness from earthbound, Link from Zelda, or cloud from final fantasy. Yet you can rename them and literally nobody thinks they’re blank slate characters.. . >	2.	People sometimes name him “Deez” or something along the lines of that.. . I’ve seen people name him “covid” and still take the game completely seriously. This is really not an issue at all
Frisk is NOT the same as sunny at all
Yeah,  I just named his sunny
To expand on this take: What if players could choose between Omori's name and what the player wants?. . I'm aware the game already kind of does this when you name Sunny, but the problem with that is it doesn't necessarily relay to the player that Sunny is their default name.. . By making it a separate choice instead of just a name you see in naming your character, your brain is (or should be) more primed to realize that Omori is their real name.
I was an idiot and didn’t notice Sunny’s name appearing and just instinctively erased it and went ‘?’ And never knew he had a canon name until I saw a video where the name appeared in the text box-
I really do not care. You can still name him sunny if you want, it's literally the default option
i named sunny after myself when i first played
I named my sunny after my social security number
It's worse when you name Sunny after yourself without knowing the plot of the game
I'm pretty sure the reason for it is to signal to the player that they know everything that Sunny knows, considering it's a game about memory, and that Sunny isn't willfully lying to the player when he's doing his whole unreliable narrator gig
Nah, it's fun. My Sunny will always be and have been Quinn.
i named him sunny
I agree. I used my own name first time through and just found it odd cuz sunny has his own entire background and character that obviously didn’t match with my own.
I named sunny after my online username because I thought it'd be funny that he didn't deserve a name.
honestly i feel like it's a gimmick sometimes, it's not like you can insert yourself into sunny because he's a pretty fixed character with like one choice (at once) made?
I named him with my name the first run. It sounded soooo bad toh as my name is not english. Then i visited the sub and the second attempt was snuuy (great succes)
I tried to name him OMORI but when I discovered you can't i changed it to SUNNY
But then I couldn't have roleplayed Sunny as Walter and treat the game as a prequel to Breaking Bad
YEA! I THOUGHT SUNNY AND PLAYER AND OMORI WERE ALL DIFFERENT PEOPLE. TILL MY FRIEND TOLD ME
Others remained Sunny to insert themselves into the game. . I renamed Sunny because i had never heard that name before and initially thought it was a stupid name. . We are not the same
Maybe. At least the option to revert the name back to Sunny after playing a bit. For these reasons:. . \-Having immersion ruined by being unable to identify with Sunny's problems.. . \-Getting stressed by having one's name attached attached to a character with Sunny's problems.. . \-Having emotional impact ruined by setting a silly name.
I had the same thought once I finished the game. I understand it was to add interactivity but I also believe anyone that removed Sunny may have removed some part of it too.
I disagree, I named Sunny as the name that I wish I had irl, and it honestly really helped me to connect with the character
TO BE FAIR since I didn’t remember or just didn’t notice his real name, I renamed him Owen, bc it started with O (he still feels like he’s Owen to me), so I was looking a bit into the production of this game, before I finished it, and I kept seeing the name Sunny, that >!Sunny killed Mari or something, or drowned her?!< It confused me, I was waiting for this Sunny character to show up… lol then I learned the truth. Anyways, changing the name mostly shielded me from completely spoiling the ending, not that this would be a thing for anyone else
I named him “Simon” on my first playthrough. I didn’t really know why. In my mind that name just fit perfectly with him. As much as I know his name is Sunny, it will always be Simon to me 🥲
I saw his name before we could name him and I thought it was pretty and didn’t wanna change it so I called him Sunny
Yeah I played with my dad and he named Sunny rando
Named Sunny Iromo because i thought he looked similar to Omori 💀
So if Sunny does not find somebody soon
(that's right, that's right). . I'll [Sunny] blow up into smithereens
And spew his tiny symphony
Just let him play his violin for you
I'm ngl my dumbass thought Sunny was holding a fishing rod
I've been waiting for a sunny plush forever, he's my comfort character and omori is not so sunny cannot be replaced
AHHHHHH I NEED A SUNNY PLSUHIE AHHHHHHH
Finally we'll have snuuy
sunny be like:. . 
My favorite part of Omori was breaking into Sunnys house and taking his boxes.. . Before bouncing off them to launch myself onto the roof
Sunny = Eugene (idk what his name is)

Mossbergs are so fucking peak
sunny if he wasnt FUCKING around


V1 tested. . Dante approved
Loved that game and it's sequel
lol love this
American Sunny > British Sunny. . Also what type of guns are those?
Just at a glance I think they're both CZ-75B
Airsoft.
American Sunny is an upgrade from British Sunny. . 
is that Gatling Gun from the hit game 🏹ARCHER UPDATE🏹 Tower Defense Simulator???
elite ball knowledge (roblox tower defense simulator mentioned??). . 
Bro thats sunny when he goes back to school



😨
Quiet kid fit
totally fits sunny fr
*Processing img 4nr5dyyq5lde1...*
You ever see the full clip?
Send link?
IDK, I saw it in a compilation...
Found it!. . [ (Hopefully it isn't that bandage scene from Oculus again...)
I imagine an alternate universe where sunny shoots Aubrey instead of slashing her... Boy would that be awesome/horrifying/interesting/Doomori real!?!?
Better shoot her in the head then Doomori 2 wouldn't exist

[
I don't think that he has guns or can shoot. If there's a knife, it'll be more accurate.
It was a joke but yeah, I do have a knife around
9 outta 10 then. Now you need someone who is 1.6m and looks like 13 years old.
ME MENTIONED?! WTF IS A STABLE MENTAL HEALTH?!
Sunny goes to O block
Where'd you get the clothes frfr, the other 2 things were from the purse right?
Gun😈🖕
Not the guns 💀💀
"Dude, you look like your about to tell your friend not to come to school tommorrow".
One for each hand
Sunny did NOT use those
The guns shoot knives btw
Everyone dying today, me included, I ain't going to jail.
I was expecting a lacey bra and panties to the side, but this is much funnier.
Why there is gun next to the clothes?t5\31hpy:2460
Are those bb pistols or sumthin
Omori but Sunny comes from a lower class neighborhood.
That looks exactly like Sunny.
Uhhhhhh
Locked and loaded 
What a nice costpl\-is that a gun? 
Nic-. . ...is that a gun
THE GUNS???
I want to steal it 
Why is there 2 guns?

Are the guns essential or can u do this cosplay without them
Dread Hunt lore (idk I haven’t read it yet)
LOL looks immaculate!
This is super cool but why tf did it remind of the meet the grahams cover
”Be strapped or get your ass clapped” aah cosplay 😭
not even gonna ask why you have two glocks
Sunny's playing Max Payne. Oh God, OH FUCK!
bro sunny on new game+ or sumn? is he shooting her instead of pushing her now? I need anwsers.

sunny is about to spread freedom

1 kd ratio isn't high enough for sunny
Bro is hitting the left 4 dead
Sunny more like gunny hyuck
The text here just says "afternoon" in katakana (アフタヌーン). . . . OMORI also is actually derived from the English spelling of "hikikomori" (ひきこもり) which just means shut in, referring to how Sunny isolates himself in his room at the start of the game. . . Furthermore, オモリ doesn't necessarily refer to weight but more so weights as in the object or fishing weights (重り). Weight as a conceptual thing would be better translated as "omomi" (重み).
Sometimes you'll hear anime characters shout omoi when lifting something heavy as an example
Ah alr  .   . Also now i really wonder why they used the specific characters they did for the page.. . 
Specific characters as in Katakana? Because it's a proper-noun, not a regular word, so they stylize it with Katakana to make it stand out.
*sunny would like to have a talk with you*. . sunny: LISTEN HERE YOU LITTLE-
*tf2 crit sound*
Did it, I get what you are saying it's either:. . A. Something is supossed to be the worst side of Mari in the Dialogue, how Sunny sees her at her worst, not necessarly in that kind of way I will talk about in B. . B. Mari actually assaulted Sunny at some point but OMOCAT grew up out of that "phase" and changed the story.. . C. If B is correct, the truth when >!Sunny pushes down Mari was supossed to be the redemption for Sunny, but it fitted both ways so when they changed the story , it stayed exactly the same but became an accident.!<. . Honestly I prefer what we got, I understand it would have had more angst, but it would be very "generic" oh the person got abused >!he killed the abusers!< but it still haunts him to this day, honestly it wouldn't fit, like it would be a game where you hate half of the cast with a passion and it would become oh boy I can't wait for X to die, ESPECIALLY IF HERO KNEW, I would have probably despised the game if it came out that way, personal opinion.
I agree honestly, It wouldn't have made a very good story compared the brilliant one we have now - despite how interesting it is to think about, if not depressing.I know it's been mentioned a lot here recently, but Scitydreamer's "Hands" Series (Hands, Will you forgive me, my best friend?, Truth, Recovery) are definitely worth a read if you haven't already.It's beautifully written and has so much emotion and effort put in, but it's *painful* how acccurate it can be and is so terrifying because it hardly changes any of the dialogue or scenes, just puts them under a new light.But overall, yes, I think OMORI's real story is better than that idea.  . Also I just realised I put that comment on the wrong post lol this was meant to be on the Ceo of Teasing vs Abusive sister meme but whoops
For some reason I didn't see your response sooner , reddit notifications , thanks for the recommendation but I  unfortunately don't really want to read that kind of story , it's kind of a trigger for me , I really hate abuse in family and friend groups , it just triggers shit, so I'm glad they didn't go with that in the end.
Sunny just eats steaks nonstop and grows to be 8 feet
Exactly
Tbf, Sunny would do that
Didn’t sunny stay in his house for 4 years
Sunny and Basil wearing school uniform during the holidays despite Sunny not having been in years
Damn, they must really love school
Isnt sunny the youngest of them all? Aka sunny is the baby of the group 
Yes but if you see dream world Omori is the tallest but because of him not having enough nutrients he never grew up properly also Sunny is just some month younger. . .
Me, drawing Sunny with huge afro: Sunny is the tallest one 
Let's be honest, Sunny would grow an afro to be the tallest
Right?
So does Sunny once he gets his knife taken away from him
Sunny just had Hands, not Fists
sunnt pulled out  . s t e a k  k n i f e
Sunnt
Oh boy another version of snuuy
Stunny
Sunny with steak knife:. imma end up the life of everyone here
He slaps them
"Keep my sister's name outta your f'ckin mouth!"
>!I think she tried so much to wake Sunny of His phantasies, but all her intents would fail miserably (example: when you try opening the door at night in the prologue)!<
The bat adds 3 attack compared to Sunny’s knife adding 25 or something. She’s barely using it.
When Sunny and Basil fight, Basil uses his garden shears and Sunny has had his knife confiscated by Kel, but the fight is still evenly matched. If Basil needs a weapon to be Sunny’s equal, I think Sunny’s stronger
Again, Basil is not a fighter. He was literally trying not to hurt Sunny at that point, and was trying to get rid of the Somethings. . . I will say, though, that the stress surrounding the fight might have made both of them weaker, as having the Afraid emotion lowers your attack
My interpretation was that his mental state became so bad that he was deluded into the idea that killing Sunny would kill the Something behind him and that he was giving his all to kill Sunny
I guess that's possible. He was deranged at that point AND angry at Sunny for moving away. It's just hard to say, because there are so many emotional layers to that fight
Didn't he literally >!beat Sunny's ass until he passed out!<
It’s been a while, but I think Sunny had no weapon and Basil was using that sharp gardening tool and even then, it was close
Okay, but my man s>!olo hanged a grown girl's body on a tree when he was 12!<, he HAS to be swole
That’s a good point, but Sunny solo dragged her up the stairs and put her in her bed
Pretty sure >!Basil helped with that too, Sunny just didn't notice him !<
Kel plays sports, is incredibly fast and can fight on equal footing with aubrey when she has a weapon(even if shes not using it to full potential) and he has a basketball. I'd wager he's the strongest of the bunch, and maybe the strongest in the town. Only thing holding him back is a reluctance to be the aggressor.. . Aubrey would definitely be second. She doesn't lack aggression, but is held back by her, well, holding back. If she used her nail bat in an actual fighting way, she would be far deadlier than Kel. But I don't count this, otherwise Sunny would be just as deadly with his Steak Knife.. . Hero is actually pretty weak. From the hints in headspace, it seems like he has really bad stamina. The only real advantage he has is that he's pretty much fully physically mature compared to the rest of the cast. That gives him the edge over Basil and easily beats Sunny.. . I would argue people underestimate Basil. Gardening isn't easy, and with what we see of his living scenario, he has a lot of plants to tend to, and Polly doesn't seem like she would help with tending the plants, just help with other things. He most definitely gets more exercise than Sunny at least, but not enough to put him too close to Hero I'd think. Though I do wonder where his tan and muscle are from all that gardening.. . Sunny has spent most of his time sleeping, playing games on the computer, and barely even moving throughout his house. The most exercise he has gotten was probably from his daily hygiene if he even does that. By far the weakest.
Basil was kinda hospitalized by a nerfed Sunny who couldn't use his hamon breathing powers
moreso hospitalized by himself tbh
I always thought Basil had stabbed or injured himself after Sunny passed out, since they're both in the same hospital ward/floor, probably for severe injuries/blood loss. I don't think a few punches could do that lol
Sunny literally can't get hit unless Kel goes down first.. . And I wouldn't say he beat Basil when he permanently lost an eye after their fight. Between the two of them, Sunny took the greater loss. Boy could've used the pepper spray he got the previous day and won without losing a body part.
>!The Pepper Spray disappears after you use it meaning Sunny/Kel used it all in the Hooligan fight, or they used what was left in the can which was a small amount enough to get them to stop fighting. If not for Basil using the shears to indirectly hurt Sunny, he would’ve won and Sunny still did more damage than Basil!<
>!Well, as I've said, Basil wasn't attacking Sunny but the thing floating behind him that he's hallucinating, and he made his intentions clear before the fight started. Even the flavor text specifically mentioned that Basil "reached inside Sunny", not "attacked him". You can tell because Sunny only had that eye wound and nothing else. If Basil actually wanted to hurt Sunny, even without the shears, it could go either way.!<
Sunny could theoretically just spam persist and stay alive forever
He can't use it in the real world, at least not in battles.
He can, he can use all the abilities he gains from the something battles in the real world l
You get Persist towards the end of Day 2 after the lake, and at the point you can't use it on any battles anymore apart from the daydream trash dungeon on Day 3. Persist allows Sunny to hold on for a bit, it doesn't make him literally invincible.
Sunny hospitalized Basil the one time they fought and that was a Sunny who couldnt use his otherworldy power of breathing to heal/power up/not die, speaking of that he hypothetically is the strongest in a fight cause bro could sit there spam persist and go full on senator armstrong on the other four, i'd say his breathing powers aren't canon but then again they're useable in the real world fights and allows Sunny to facetank Aubrey infinitely while Kel dies in 3 hits so like
Sunny couldn't use it against Aubrey because you only get the ability after the lake incident and it doesn't make him literally invincible.
Basil didn't use the weapon until the very end and was targeting the Something behind Sunny's back, not Sunny himself, hence the weak attacks.
i'd say that basil is stronger then sunny he does gardening and stuff sunny hadn't been outside for 4 years . . i feel like sunny has more rage in his body however so i'd want to fight him significantly less however. . &#x200B;. . but this is just strength, not fighting. . &#x200B;. . >!for the people referencing the sunny and basil fight i'd say basil wasn't trying to hurt sunny technically, he was trying to hurt "something",and he was injured from being beaten up by aubrey, so they weren't on the same level/doing the same thing. plus this isn't fighting it's strength!<. . &#x200B;. . also doesn't hero have bad stamina? i'd say him and aubery r around the same
For the spoilered part, I've been saying the same thing for the longest time. In a fight where Basil isn't delusional and actually wants to hurt Sunny, I think he'll win.
Sunny can heal himself by breathing and beat up an entire gang, pretty sure he should be at the top
sunny w knife solos
Imo… it’s sort of wild for her to place blame on Sunny for it though. . . Just going on what Aubrey knows, Sunny lost his sister, whom he was very close to, to suicide. That’s *immensely* traumatic. And then all of his friends want him to listen to them vent about how much *they* miss her. That’s kinda fucked.. . Like I get it’s a tragic situation where theres no true villain and no true person to be mad at so the people involved need to just pick *someone* to direct their anger at, but based on the knowledge the characters have, it’s wacky imo to pick the grieving kid who lost his sister to suicide.
Tbh sunny is very selfless character pre incident he endure the 9months of overpractice without to telling anyone about his problems because he want to spend time with her sister and to please everyone around him
I think he's definitely selfless, but a lot of that is probably just from low self esteem and being bad at communication. It is sad though, he was a genuinely good kid and didn't deserve everything that happened to him
Yahp the low self esteem and bad at communicating contributed also,
I think Sunny was probably a confidant for all of them (minus the older kids ofc). Basil and Aubrey both vented to him and Kel trusts Sunny enough to tell him what happened to Hero in the graveyard. Plus even Hero trusts Sunny's judgement enough to ask him what he thinks about his career. Sunny's a good listener.
She doesn't know sunny moving already until the 3rd day
She was assumedly nearby Sunny's house on day 2 when you find the graffiti in front of kel's house. She gets around and she has friends who get around. I don't think you can necessarily declare that she only found out on the third day, she would have had a more significant reaction if that were the case.
I already told this is in the end of memory lane and this is point where sunny already getting his self again for 4yrs
I know it's at the end of memory lane. I know this game way too well.
If I remember correctly, Basil's album mentions how he used to vent to Sunny as well. Along with the other people in Faraway Town who are willing to tell their life stories to some random kid I guess Sunny is just built different in a way that makes people want to vent to him.
Unless Sunny is a trained ninja, yeah it does.
Wow, rude Sunny
-heard from inside Sunny’s house moments before a grunt and shoulder tackle, which was followed by a door falling over and a teenage male saying “get outside bitch, we’re fixing your goddamn life” -
Dont worry lad the basketball cavalry is here
Sunny you gotta open the door right now,
Or ill play baby shark on loop forever
Yeah but sunny didn’t know about that until he goes back outside. Probably just a game overlook.
Why not? It's sorta implied Sunny went out for a short while after the tragedy befor shutting himself in for good
Agreed. It would’ve been noticed in testing almost immediately, so it feels quite deliberate here.
but in headspace it says he's afraid of spiders so sunny did know🤨
"haha yesterday you had a nice dream Sunny"
just kill him how sunny wouldve
i want a snuuy ploosh
UPDATE THREAD:  . i just passed the sunny section and im back at white space. i did not mean to get to sunny's part but oh my god
UPDATE 2: . . just got the map in white space
It forshadows >!her tendency to make fun of others and it won"t be her first time in headspace!< .. . Like everything in Headspace, >!the elements that Sunny found distasteful in his friends are vastly smaller but they are *still* there while what he liked about them is more prominant.!<
Ohh I see, >!so Headspace does still show what they really were like then, just with the positive qualities more accentuated than the bad ones? !<
From my understanding at least.. . Considering the fact that Headspace is a fantasy, every aspect of it is exaggerated and the simple fact that >!Omori as a concept exists and Sunny does not, it is heavily implied that the negative aspects of Sunny's friends and acquaintances are either lessoned or showcased in a light-hearted manner.!<. . Another example is Berly, her loud and rebellious personality is quite charming in Headspace but >!in real life she is not quite shown in such a positive light!< .
That makes a lot of sense  Thank you for explaining

im not reading these but im just adding censor bleeps so.. . coming back here when i've beaten the game
I wonder how Sunny would feel about someone making perfume based on his unhealthy coping mechanism and self-hatred.
Exactly, and I don't see a picture of her and Sunny in her room anywhere.
Well she did group Sunny in with everyone else who she felt abandoned her. I wouldn’t set up pictures of people who did that to me in my room either. Especially of the one who stabbed me 2 days prior…
I'm pretty sure she wasn't stabbed lmao. She would have been in the hospital for the rest of the game if that was the case
unless that room is a colosseum where they fight to the death
Legit why I don’t ship her with Sunny. She deserves someone who isn’t below the bare minimum 😭
ow
Thats Sunny
Oh... sorry my bad
He convinces their mom to let them sleep over at Sunny’s. But I get what you mean
OP, could you please add Omori too and not just Sunny? Not that I'd vote him out, but he should be there
Wheres Sunny thought?
sunny
>!I recall seeing a... **"""Fanart"""** on the CursedOmori subreddit about Sunny/Omori just going cannibal on his friends.!<. . . >!Hell of a good time to recall that.!<

is it normal to me warching those videos over and over??
Yes
Yes²
(You have no life innit?). . Yes³
(). . Yes⁴
She literally is just sunny with long hair, it’s kinda uncanny once you realize it
This makes me think of a au where none of Sunny’s friends aren’t real and he just imagines them to try and cope with trauma- Wait,that’s just kinda the Hikkimori route.
You'll be here soon
Good bot
bad bot
You’ll be here soon
i would like to see that.. . &#x200B;. . sunny just pretending to be mari.

My goodness i could unsee it now
>!sunny....I....love...you!<
He did that to Sunny.
Oh, sorry, that was a joke. I meant it literally. >!You know, because of the hanging? They made it look like she stood on the toy-box to hang herself. I guess that was actually both of them, though.!<
Ah I get it.
I saw other interpretations being that Sunny still imagines Mari's height in relation to his. . Then again, comparing Sunny and Omori(aka 12yo Sunny), he barely grew a few centimeters, so idk about that...
>!Iram be like “ it’s ok Sunny you don’t have to practice the violin today “ !<
Yeah I see a lot of people seem to think that because of Mari’s failings she and sunny didn’t have as good a relationship as sunny portrayed in headspace but it’s still very clear, in my opinion at least, that they still loved each other a lot, in spite said failings
>! "She loved you and you killed her." "You loved her and you killed her." !<
Yeah, it was just an argument that ended in tragedy. You argue and fight with people who you love all the time. They were just unlucky.
>!You as the player never interact with her at all. Every time you see her you're wearing sunnys rose colored glasses. You know NOTHING about who she is or how she was. All you have is secondhand information from friends(who are biased because shes dead), and sunnys warped version of her who is perfect and can do no wrong(death bias and litle brother bias).!<
>!what about the memories at the memory lane?!<
We see her in real memories and in photos as well, not just in dreams. and her behaviour in those things is accurate to her dream counterpart. So what reason is there to think that her dream self isn't accurate to how she really was?
Were the images of Sunny's friends distorted and displayed incorrectly? If not, why do we see the image of Marie in "rose-colored glasses"? If so, please clarify where and when the image of this or that character in the world of dreams did not coincide with the real one.
You sure? Tons of people in this comment section and on this community DO talk about how perfectionist she is. Also, where did you get that from? My man, you have to redo your vibe check. Mari is a flawed person, but she loved Sunny and Sunny loved her, the game tells us that. She would never get violent with him if he said "no" to her.
She loves Sunny!
Her name means Truth.. . Also, I think she and Sunny had really similar faces. That's why I think Basil stabbed Sunny's right eye.
Aw look Sunny & Hector are crying
"Sunny killed himself after his friends wouldn't forgive him". . Would fuck up the ending so badly I'd be so angry
Sunny, get the banana
While you're right about Sunny still moving out after neutral endings as well, and Basil committing sepukku either way, the context of the sirens may change. After all, during the shut-in route we are clueless as to how Sunny's friend group is faring right now, or how Basil is too dependant on him to the point when he's ready to die. It would be only natural if the sirens applied to whatever happened to Sunny then, unless it was supposed to indicate the mystery of what happened outside while we were busy beating up bad guys in the dreams.. . Also, I wasn't really joking. Were you? 
that was literally what SUNNY feared the most
I don't think she's manipulative because as I've said we don't get much time and if we don't get the group back then omoris going to win as sunny loses his power of hope and succumbs  . Thus was the writers fastest and maybe one of the worst ways tp bring them together as she learns barely anything but "if you have a crap homelife you can do anything" in-game reason that could be a pretty good explanation
Yeah that makes a lot of sense I do suppose. If you think about it almost everyone has an 'Omori' to speak of. Unless you're just like the happiest person in the world. But anyone can succumb to hopelessness and despair.
Yea but it would take a really bad event to get omori lvls of madness. But still 90% of Aubry fans are just simps
Tbh Ozai as Sunny would fucking rock
: Give me my wine, NOW!. . : Sunny, get the rope.
And then sunny woke up, crying. His sister came charging into the room and hugged him. “Whats wrong?” she asked “y-you died! and it was my fault” “its okay that was just a dream now go back to bed, don’t be so stressed the concert yesterday was amazing”
Honestly I WANT this to be canon 
Absolutely, I still can't accept the fact that she >!is dead!<
Ao3 authors, GET THR FUCK OVER HERE NOW WE NEED YOU
no, no, wait, this would be great, AND THEN OMORI WOULD GET A SEQUEL UNCOVERING >!WHY THE FUCK WOULD A TWELVE YEAR OLD HAVE SUCH A WEIRD AND DISTURBING DREAM!<, AND YOU EVEN COULD DO IT SO THAT AFTER YOU PLAY THE FIRST GAME NO MATTER THE ENDING THE EXACT SAME THINGS HAPPEN IN THE OMORI 2 OR SMTH BECAUSE NO MATTER IF >!SUNNY DIES OR NOT!< AND STUFF IT WAS JUST A DREAM JEEZ THAT'S INTERESTING NOW IS IT 😀😀 oh i went overboard expanding an interesting concept again would you look at it how unfortunate ANYWAYS AND THEN-. >!/j applies to the entire comment, k?!<
When Sunny said "I have to tell you something", he didn't mean the truth
He meant he got sponsored by Raid Shadow Legends
: Raid: Shadow Legends! Raid is one of the-. . : Get the fuck out of here.
Sunny was just going to tell that he got a cool eyepatch! Look at him, being a pirate and getting away from navies... Or in this case, the police!
"Attention, everyone. I apologize, but you've been mistaken. Sunny resides in Headspace, Omori's in Faraway town. They just copy each other's looks."
"The gang didn't forgive Sunny"
That seems like it is canon.
Sunny dies in a car accident while moving away
No.
In any ending that Sunny doesn’t kill himself, him and his mom end up dying in a car accident on the way to their new home.
Sunny's parents acknowledged his mistake and took him to therapy, resulting him to face his fears and moved on with his life. . . In short, everything is actually okay.
Ngl, I thought of that Todd too. Great show. . :Sunny, you are all of the things that are wrong with you. . : :(
HAHAHA
I genuinely think she may have changed. As it stands, the game itself has no nsfw stuff, and even without an apologist mindset; The slime girl boss fight could be chalked up to Sunny’s average “phase” boys go through during puberty. . . It just sucks that so much of the anime and anime-esque works of fiction, have underlying roots of suspicious customs. Alas, forgiveness is key.
“Sunny canonically has watched Morbius.”
"the gang didnt accept sunny after the good ending" or "the gang accepted sunny after the good ending"
sunny ends up not ruling the world with his fascist dictatorship. the end.
Sunny went on to be an alt-right commentary YouTuber after his friends were wrongly pissed. He said sorry, what else they want smh
"The cannon ending was sunny giving in to omori's controller"
Sunny and his mom die in a fatal car crash immediately after the credits.
Sunny telling the truth isn't canon.
Huh, I only really focused on the plain and simple part, which basically makes him say "You remind me of white tulips, cause you're a basic bitch"
I kinda interperate that as sunny blocking out most of his memories about who he was, maybe in an attempt to prevent his personality/emotions from hurting anyone/from him remembering what happened
Reminder that in the real world what basil actually said was “they're comfortable. Simple, modest, and perfect.. Just like SUNNY.” Canonically basil sees Sunny as perfect.
I sure hope that doesn't lead to some sort of serious conflict fueled by cognitive dissonance....
He just couldn't remember him saying the real line without it being painful 😭

I know what he says, but I would interpret that more as him saying they're perfect the way they are.
You can interpret it any way you want, it does lend itself to this theory along with the other evidence.
>! Yes, he loves Sunny enough to stab him with pruning shears. !<
mentally unstable people consider the strangest things love, that doesn’t make it any less meaningful to them.
>!He thought he was attacking Sunny's Something!<
yes! :D
I've long latched onto my headcanon that Sunny is just down bad for Aubrey and Basil. Mofo is triggering ALL of the bisexual flags like he's playing minesweeper! 
I personally love gay Sunny, but all headcanons are valid and fun!
Exactly how Sunny would want his self insert OC to behave lmao
Fandom: You called Sunny cute?. . Basil: Cause he's my best friend, he's my pal. He's my home-boy, my rotten soldier. He's my sweet cheese, my good-time boy.
>my good-time ~~boy~~ [bough~ay.]()
Can't believe Bagel said Snuuy is fat in british "bulbous". Also the cute part is neat, but Basil just called snuuy fat fancy
I usually don't ship gay characters often. . BUT I FUCKING SHIP HARD!
love the implication that they're already gay, you just don't like shipping them
Real . . 
Omg! Stop! Those are children!
Ngl if you see kids holding hands and you see something perverse in that, you're kind of a creep
btw. . before entering black space stranger will describe the plants by reusing basil's dialogue; however, the tulip one is more detailed and is directed towards sunny, not omori. in sunny route at least. in omori route he just walks to the left
Gay gay homosexual gay

I mean... I call my sister cute or a dog cute, I honestly think that their relationship is more of one akin to siblings than anything else mostly because I just can't see them as anything (I'm not gonna lie, I didn't understand what the post specifically meant and whether it was satire or not so I just decided to give my honest opinion about their friendship)
because gay
what did sunny mean by this 🤔🤔
My headcanon of them is very gay
twink
sunny dreamt about aubrey having a crush on him
I, too, have the power fantasy of completely ignoring my crush in my dreams to chase a boy for multiple dreams instead
aubster still appeared in some of them
Note that Basil isn’t exactly calling Omori/Sunny cute, he’s just calling flowers cute.
Why did Sunny dream about his boy best friend assigning him a flower he finds cute?
You are over exagerating it its just a flower
\- Omori
and I think you're downplaying it
Oh is the omori world sunny's dream and the sunny world the real world
[Insert “what’s more Bi: Bisexuality or Sunny” picture here]
Just like me fr
Gay
I mean, calling your friends this and that is not gay at all
I assume that you don't know of any other examples of these two characters interacting in this way other than this one specifically, right?
Yes but this is the internet . . . Without making two gay characters what would the internet be without it. . Cat videos?
What‘s the context of the second one btw? I don’t remember that line. (I’m just curious)
It appears right after the first line in the game!
"The Matrix", recommended by spamton to help snuuy escape the matrix and become top G

they're watching sunny and kris.

Not as well known but my favorite quote from the game:. . "You're a good person, Sunny. I know you're a good person! A good person wouldn't do something like that..."
They wouldn't. Rolling Something under the bus like that wasn't very cash money of him. /j

WHY IS EVERYTHING I LOVE BECOMING LEGO. . AAAAAAAAAAA-
im ashamed to report your mom has become lego. . dont ask me how i know this. . god my pp feels fuckin weird after than day
legoussy 
LEGUSSY

Quick note: He got the set on his Birthday, not Christmas
Speaking of which, wasn't that like, his twelfth birthday? What twelve year old wants a giant building block set? I wouldn't have even tried to hide to my disappointment if someone got me a giant building block set for my twelfth birthday. The hell were they thinking?
Speak for yourself 
I'm 18, if I got a huge Lego set for my 20th birthday I'd be so excited.
It was probably meant to be LEGO, referred to in a non trademark infringing way, rather than actual building blocks meant for younger kids.
I don't know much about law but I'm pretty sure it's fine to mention brand names in creative works as long as you don't portray them in a bad light. Although I guess you could argue that Sunny being uninterested in them is doing that so IDK.
I do, I want that UCS Lego Star Destroyer still
Speak for yourself, motherfucker
All 12 year olds I met would be very happy to receive a giant building block set
It makes sense though, i doubt its coincidental
It's referring to the building block set, as he was more interested in the box than the set.
It's said in the old library that he didn't really like the lessons bc it made him miss TV time with his friends soo
No Sunny didn’t really like playing his violin. He had to miss out on an hour of Saturday TV binging with his friends for violin lessons- plus he had been messing up so much that his fingers hurt.
ok but we saw when he got his violin and we know his reaction was not of anger, the negative emotions came after he started noticing the responsability that it put over him, it's not the violin, in the lessons and the pressure it caused him.
As the others said, he didnt. Plus, there is the lego set too.
I think sunny's negative emotions to violin are caused by s perfectionism, he doesn't hate his violin in essence. The item is just a humor about sending wrong gifts such as sending bikes to lames...I guess?![gif](emote|freeemotespack|thinkingfacehmm)





... are caused by SMUG LORD's perfectionism, ...

I think it's not X or Y, it's X **and** Y. The violin definitely makes Sunny sad, but I think just as equally it makes him feel angry/upset/resentful. It serves as a reminder of multiple things. . . . While the initial event of getting the present was happy, overtime it became something to regret by Sunny. In his eyes, getting the violin caused him huge amounts of stress and made him unhappy. He didn't realize the true amount of work required to play in a recital, and rather than get him closer to Mari, it created a rift of resentment between them. He could never play to her standards no matter how hard he tried. That resentment at times represented itself in anger, most notably when Sunny threw his violin down the stairs and caused Mari's death. . . . Plus, "It's not what I wanted" could be in the sense of regret — that getting the violin wasn't actually what he wanted, but something else.
>Plus, "It's not what I wanted" could be in the sense of regret — that getting the violin wasn't actually what he wanted, but something else.. . Definitely agree here. One of the core parts of Sunny's personality was his attachment to Mari, and the violin was a vector that made sure that he was able to spend more time with her even as she became too busy.
What if it's litterally present time. Sunny hates his live as a shut-in
Oh my god.
Damn.
>!He didn’t want to receive a violin as a present maybe, he may think the violin caused it all!<
Probably. He did like it because he wants to do it, but over time it becomes like a chore to him, and... you know... that happened.. . Though I do wonder if in the good ending, will he play it again?
>!not unless he somehow gets another violin, since his old one was thrown down the stairs and smashed to pieces.!<
Oh my
oh god that makes perfect sense

God I love this game’s little-but-possibly-unintentional details.
Inside that present there's a copy of fallout 76. . Everyone hates it
It's based on how he is prone to sudden outbursts and throwing tantrums. When he got something he didn't like on his birthday, he hid in the box for the rest of the party. When he couldn't keep up with Mari, he threw his violin down the stairs. It's not based on one event just based on how Sunny is
hmmm that make sense
Probably.
tag spoilers please
I wonder if there are more things like that in the items you get in the game

Democratic Socialism and Sunny
Sunny and Omori
It's pretty sunny outside...
Sunny exists
He would try to help Sunny study for tests, which was a struggle as Sunny would often prefer to ignore his attempts to educate and doodle and daydream instead
I headcanon that after mari failed helping sunny study, she asked hero to help, and it actually works. Sunny clearly looks up to hero and sees his positive traits in a more exaggerated way so I just figure he actually listens to him
Yes
sunny just like me frfr
Okay hear me out-. . I see too many headcanons of Hero lashing out at Sunny and Basil after the truth is revealed, and I honestly can’t see that happening with him. While I can definitely see him storming out of the room after Sunny finishes explaining, he would probably do this to spare everyone of his reaction, especially Sunny and Basil. The last time he let anger get the best of him, it resulted in him hurting Kel, and he doesn’t want that to happen again to his other little brothers. He would give himself a moment to process everything, maybe while practicing some breathing techniques from Mari. The anger is still there, but it’s not as intense as before. They all made the mistake of leaving each other when they needed each other the most, and Hero is determined not to let them drift apart again.
this but plus one hole in drywall
you’re absolutely right
He is Sunny’s rescue father.
Poor guy would have two siblings to care of at that rate!
In my headcanon, after the ending, Hero is the one who tells Sunny that as upset as he is about Mari's death, he can't imagine the guilt and trauma that Sunny went through, and will do whatever he can to help support Sunny after he leaves town.
That almost sounds like it could be canon and faithful to the main story!
We all can hope
>Hero to me is a people pleaser. . Yeah, I can definitely see that. Especially considering how he vows to keep the group together, to the point that I've seen fans say he'd forgive Sunny and Basil quicker for the sake of the group.. . >His character parallels to Sunny are that both loved Mari, blamed themselves for her death, and spent a long time in self isolation until Kel got them both out, 3 years apart.. . >Eventually realize that he and Sunny both lost someone important that night, and that both Sunny and Basil had punished themselves enough.. . I've seen this pointed out in other comments as well, and I like those parallels! Adds more to his character.. . >In the Five Stages of Grief Theory about Omori (which I don't believe), he usually represents Depression, however I'd say that he'd be Bargaining with how hard he works in college, and in doing favors for other people.. . Yeah, I agree. He definitely represents bargaining better with his desire to keep everyone together and happy after Mari's death.
After seeing how decrepit Aubrey's home life is, hero practically forces her to some stay with them. He also decides to stay in town till a bit after sunny and basil have healed. . . He has a map in his college dorm with a few locations marked. One is is his home town, one is the town sunny moves two, and third is the Niagara falls because he wants to visit them with everyone. . . Also he is that one college room mate that knows how to cook and thus cooks for everyone
I like all of those!
He would forgive Sunny sooner than a lot of people think.. . *runs for shelter*
Not rly a headcanon, more just "what I would do if I were writing a fanfic about what happened after sunny told everyone the truth," but.... . >! I usually imagine that hero doesn't forgive sunny for at least a while, and maybe even lashes out at him !<. . Idk
Headcanons:. . >!Kills himself after every ending but the good ending, idk why but I picture him OD'ing to do it.!<. . (Probably unnecessary spoiler) >!He's the only one of Sunny's friends who never really forgives him or even accepts what really happened but after enough time still comes around to reconciling with him. Either that or gets into a fight with Kel about siccing the cops on Sunny and one of the two almost kill the other, leaving Hero perfectly able to empathize with Sunny.!<. . Latin-American, speaks fluent Spanish.. . Winds up finding a middle ground between being a cook and a doctor and becomes a dietician.. . Closeted bisexual because of his catholic upbringing, seeing how common catholicism is among Latinos in general. The other four are all bi/pan though so he comes out eventually.. .

While I agrre that'd it definitely take time for Hero to accept Sunny's confession, I don't think he'd need to go through/cause a near-death experience with Kel to empathise with him. The two grieved in a similar way, both locking themselves from the world and not caring for their health as a result.. . >Latin-American, speaks fluent Spanish.. . Yeah, him being bilingual works imo.. . >Winds up finding a middle ground between being a cook and a doctor and becomes a dietician.. . I like that headcanon!. . >Closeted bisexual because of his catholic upbringing, seeing how common catholicism is among Latinos in general. The other four are all bi/pan though so he comes out eventually.. . Eh, idk. He seems the most hetro-coded out of the whole gang to me. We only see him with Mari, and the only other person people would ship him with is Sally. But, you do you I suppose.
Sunny, I remember you're I love you
Sunny’s middle name is NOT John
You're right. It's Afternoon
This guy doesn't know Jhon "every Omo has it ri" omori
John omori
So true
"Sunny... hmph, what a poor excuse of a man you are."
Sunny sideup
Most AO3 authors agree that Sunny’s last name is Suzuki
it could just be the flowers that basil give to everyone and a combination of 2 for hero - kel and mari - sunny. because it's in SUNNY's dream so maybe
I heard someone say Sunny’s last name is Suzuki or somethibg. Anyway, that’s a headcanon I’ve used for a while
well ik that sunnys name is suzuki but idk the rest
In headspace no last names.  Irl I only know marks and Sunny's last name is apparently Suzuki according to ig the fandom or perhaps it's cannon.
Sunny: Samuel Rodríguez XDXDXDXd. . Nah I think it'd be Sony or something (like the TV's)
Sunny
Coming back to it, that was probably a hint of Sunny’s self-destructive lifestyle.
It's just microwaved Steak??? Reheated food?? How is that destructive?
The stake is clearly not of good quality as it makes him nauseous but he still chooses to chow down on it, assuming this has been his behavior for the past month since his mom left, he's willingly chowing down on food that actively makes him sick.
Do you immediately feel sick biting into something? Usually you'd feel sick after eating all of the item that made you sick. And his mom left him Steak on a night there wasn't going to be electricity. Sunny ate what he had because of the people around him. Not because of himself, he's not Omnipotent, just a kid.
From what context clues we have, this isn't just a singular occurrence, the house has been up for sale for over a month and therefore this lifestyle has been going on for a month, assuming this is the quality of food he's had for that duration of time, it's not hard to conclude that this isn't just a one-off incident but consistent behavior.
The problem with that is "assuming" we only know of 1 occurrence, and that is the one we saw in game.
I mean, maybe his microwave and fridge run on dedicated batteries, or maybe Sunny "There is nothing here" Suzuki has a hard with seeing things that aren't there
I don't believe the power actually shut off. Sunny's computer and phone still worked even on the last day, after all. Plus Hero and Kel didn't mention anything about it. Sunny's just a weirdo who likes the dark.
But his mom said the power cut out?. . Idk man maybe its just an inconsistency to let the plot move foward
Her exact words were "I forgot to tell the electric company that we need a few extra days before we're ready to move, so the lights **might** cut out sometime tonight.". . Keyword: might, and even then she only mentioned the lights, not the rest of the power.
I'm not even sure that wasn't a hunger fueled hallucination, that entire section is suspect.
Sunny deserves to get better mentally ❤️
✍️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Forget cold take. . This should be the frozen take
Sunny deserves many consensual hugs
Sunny definetely imagined he had cooked that steak
sunny is a character
i like sunny he's cool
sunny has done nothing wrong
>Sunny did nothing wrong. . \[\]([)
free my boy he innocent🙏
Sunnys mother was starving Sunny on purpose, but he got out before he could die, and the mom didn't look like a monster.
Can we talk about how mean the shit OMORI tells to Sunny is? Like the dude got no chill
Sunny’s name is ironic because he never goes outside and probably has a Vitamin D deficiency.
Omori is not an alterego, just sunny in his dreams
Sunny is a catboy
Sunny’s mom is a bad cook that’s why he threw up after eating the steak also how tf did the microwave work if the power was cut?
Cold take : Sunny has trauma
Sunny is a good protagonist
cold take: sunny regularly hides in the fridge
This is off-topic anyway.. . Disregarding their canonicity, I still am 100% justified in attributing Sunny with responsibility for framing a suicide.. . &#x200B;. . >Photo of Guilt - **You want to scream for help**, but you're afraid... you mumble to yourself... what if they ask what happened? **There's no way you can tell them the truth. Who would be able to forgive him?** Who would believe... that it was... an accident?. . Sunny has the right idea here. Go get help. But he doesn't. Why?. . Because he's selfish. He literally prioritizes *'people forgiving him'* over potentially saving Mari's life. Sunny makes an active decision to hide the truth from everyone and symultaniously dooms Mari to death.. . Mind you that Basil did do absolutely nothing at this point.. . &#x200B;. . >Photo of **Support** \- Your shoulders feel heavy. A familiar voice whispers **something unspeakable**. Your eyes widen. It tells you to follow its lead. It says... it's the only way out... It says... that everything will be okay.. . Sunny retains the mental awareness to know that staging a suicide is a reprehensible act. Hence '*something* ***unspeakable***'.. . Despite this moral awareness, he applies a positive label: Support.. . Again, he is being selfish. His desire to get out of the situation unscathed overwrites his own morals. He literally considers this as vile, but goes along with it anyway. Because he prioritizes himself over everyone else and evene his own conscious.. . Judging by this, there's no ground to argue that Sunny wasn't aware of the moral implications of what they were about to do.. . &#x200B;. . >Photo of a Lie - As you and BASIL step into the house, you look back towards the trees and see it. The light engulfs it as it sways in the wind... **For a moment, you feel at peace**. You hate yourself for feeling this way. **Is that all, then? Is everything going to be okay now**. . Sunny once again feeling positively about what they did. The last line here sounds downright dismissive of the entire situation, and iss  entierly self-centered. He doesn't seem to care about anything else than *'everything being okay'.*. . Mind you that this is after any claim that Sunny was in a genuine 'dream-state' has lost any feet to stand on.. . &#x200B;. . TL,DR: The scrapped descriptions provide ample evidence that Sunny a) had the mental awarenes to both realize the gravity of his own actions, as well as the depravity inherent to the act of staging a suicide.. . and b) both the motive and the intent to go through with the plan in order to protect himself from the consequences of his own actions.. . Particulary aggravating is the fact that he actively discarded the correct option, which is calling for help and save Mari, yet made an deliberate decision to NOT do this. Sunny both had the mental awareness  and idea to end the entire ordeal then an there, yet made an active decision against it, which ultimately led to everything that followed.. . Judging by all of this I see zero reason to apply anything less than 50% of the blame for staging a suicide to him.. . Considering that 100% of Mari's death and 50% of the hanging is on him, this leaves him at minimum of 75% of the total blame.
Bad bot
Snuuy
Sunny’s cool
i think sunnys having a killer dream rn
My guess is that she was euthanized, if thats not the case then >!sunny probably killed her or feels like he killed her, considering the scene where omori rips her open in black space!<
i remember seeing in a theory video that the whole black space scene was an intrusive thought that sunny had
I just stabbed myself to avoid doing that ;-;
You can just not do it too
Sunny saw other hallucinations on the sidewalks of Faraway Town, to be fair.
Problem is, >!while for Sunny it's more or less understandable to attempt defending himself like this, Basil's reasoning in the assistance simply wouldn't fly with the rest because he did so willingly. Once Sunny leaves he'll most likely get his shit rocked or just isolated from the rest of the group, which would worsen things for him - while Sunny gets to move to a new place by the next day. While omitting his participation would still lead to him being judged for this, it wouldn't be nearly as bad, because as far as they'd be concerned, his only crime was not reporting the body, while everything else would still be true - so Basil still has a bigger chance of retaining his circle of friends and getting better mentally with them being by his side. Or maybe it's just me being pragmatic about this!<
i agree that the truth would be hard for basil to own up to, but having sunny lie on his behalf is absolutely counter to the idea of the game. . now it's very possible that sunny's parents helped cover it up which would help lessen the blow to basil because he was just a part of the coverup, but the truth will still get out eventually that he was the one to suggest the idea
>! Sunny's parents were DEFINITELY in on it to some extent. !<. . >! There's no way the Police would have bought the suicide plot. The game heavily implies Sunny's father knew, based on the one scene where he snaps at him while cutting the tree, which we know happened for real because the tree is indeed cut in Real life. Its also likely his mother did aswell based on what she says during the "truth" sequence. !<. . >! In my eyes, what most likely happened was that they found out it had been an accident and decided to either play along themselves, or make some deal with the authorities to keep it under wraps. Sunny's father initially went through with it, but later realized he couldn't look at his son the same way ever again, so he left. His mother, on the hand, became increasingly distant and neglectful, as Sunny's inability to move on made her incable of moving on. !<
That’s not really realistic in my opinion. I think Aubrey would understand, but still cut herself off from sunny because of the constant reminder that he’s technically the reason Mari isn’t there anymore. Kel probably wouldn’t even believe him at first, and as he slowly came to the conclusion that sunny really did do it he may try to see it from Sunny’s perspective and get all the facts. IMO he’s the most likely to forgive of the 3. It’s also possible that he would also cut sunny off and then completely bury all of the feelings on the whole situation as long as possible until he’s forced to confront it again. Hero was in love with Mari. Even if one day he did managed to come to reason it’s unlikely he would ever truly forgive sunny, and would probably never want to see him again for similar reasons to Aubrey. The idea that they all just understand and forgive him sounds good, but I just cannot believe it. It’s all up for debate of course, we have absolutely no idea what happens after.
Sunny,  i named him faris in my game
lmao gotcha
Interesting takes here, for me I interpreted it as the mental pain it takes to dig through deep trauma. Sometimes, massive pain.. .  A viewer can easily understand losing fingers to probably be extremely painful, and that the further you go, the more painful it becomes for Omori (Sunny's mind.). . Yet he remains determined to endure this pain to find the truth. In the grand perspective, facing his dark feelings would be the first step.
Hands are one of the biggest symbols in the games. Sunny used his hands to kill Mari. It probably felt to him like his hands had a mind of their own when it happened. Regardless his hands are murder weapons that are a constant reminder of what happened. Hence the throne of hands in red space. Omori is king of red space and embraces Sunny's view of himself as a murderer.
Also, whether Sunny’s parents know of the incident. Whilst his father *did* disown him, we can’t know for sure.
Yeah Blackspace is pretty far from literal, my interpretation is that's how Sunny *feels* about his father's reaction. Sometimes people say things they don't mean in times of emotional distress and a very traumatized and guilt-stricken 12 year old isn't going to sit down and think about what is dad meant to say instead.
Yeah, Sunny and Basil are just children, Sunny's parents, or at least his dad has to know she didn't kill herself, it would just be impossible for two kids to hide perfectly a murder
I imagine what happened is that they got the autopsy report, figured out it was sunny, and decided to cover it up for Sunny's sake. It's also possible that the mortician would have found the bruises and such and informed Sunny's parents since it's implied that they had an open casket funeral and the mortician would have to deal with the bruising to make the body presentable. . . The tension from this decision is likely what broke his parents marriage. The timeframe for the game is mid to late 90s when things like mental health services were much more limited and typically privatized so it's also not surprising that they didn't send Sunny to a therapist and his parents didn't take marriage counseling especially if they immediately divorced and money became tight due to the funeral.. . It is worth noting though that I don't think it's ever outright stated that they even technically separated. The only thing I can think of that is somewhat literal is the fact that Sunny refers to his parents bed specifically as Mom's bed. It's possible that his dad travels for work but at that point it's just splitting hairs.
I thought she did die because of hanging. Once Sunny turns around, he sees her eye open resulting in his 'something'. I thought the fall just paralysed her and she woke up during the cover-up and actually died to the hanging. I don't think it was a metaphor because that whole sequence seemingly accurately portrays the event.
It’s left intentionally slightly ambiguous, but the symbolism all points to her dying in the bed while Sunny’s panicking. Especially the room with the rows of sick Maris. “This person is breathing steadily” to “this person is not breathing” along with the photos in that room implies very heavily that Sunny was at her side the moment she died.  . Also if she woke up during the hanging, she would have moved or struggled, and there’s no indication of that.
When people die, their eyes don’t automatically close.  Sunny probably didn’t see or pay attention to mari’s open eye until he looked back
The truth scene outright states that "this person is not breathing" if you inspect Mari's body in Sunny's room. (And while that could just be Sunny's reimagination of it, the point of this scene is to be *exposition*, so it'd be pretty cruel and pointless of the game to lie to your face during the final plot twist exposition.)
Isnt there a box in black space 2 that litterally tells you something along the lines of: You hear your mom crying... "Dont worry, everything is going to be okay... "" which heavily hints they knew
Not really a mystery, but id still love to know wether mari actually forgave sunny for her death, or if the spirit that we see was just sunnys imagination. Theres evidence for both.
>!OMORI is a realistic game. There is no ghosts or spirits. Everything that seems a ghost or spirit is a fruit of Sunny’s mind. Mari probably didn’t have enough time to think if she forgives Sunny before she died after being pushed off.!<
>!the only thing that makes me think that mari's ghost is real is when sunny meets her in the piano room and when hero walks in he says that he could have sworn he heard music!<. . [link]()
I don't see how Sunny's childhood fantasy headspace land adapting to severe trauma fantasy headspace land is supernatural
it is implied headspace is much older then Sunny
He created a kingdom inside his head, but that's it, a kingdom that he created, merely his imagination.
>! Except for the one case of Hero claiming he heard a piano while a cutscene with Sunny and ghost Mari plays, during the night when Kel and him sleep over !<
>!I have a bit of a hard time believing that there would be so many implications of it being Mari’s real ghost in the game if we weren’t meant to think it’s a real ghost though. Everything that’s just a hallucination is immediately shown to just be a hallucination and isn’t noticed by any characters other than sunny!<
The presence of white egret orchids imply this, as well.
"my thoughts will follow you in your dreams". . Policemen somehow not noticing broken bones and internal bleeding. . Somehow everyone in faraway town being wacky and zainy in the world's most disfunctional town. . Sunny somehow having a coherent dreamworld that has continuity between more than 2 dreams. . Sunny somehow surviving on a crude steak for several days. . I seriously have a hard time believing Omori is realistic  . . . edit: piano room playing song, with sunny meeting her and hero hearing her too . . Basil and Sunny both seeing the exact same somethings in each other,
>!"Realistic game" does not mean no ghosts or spirits lol. Sure, it may be fantasies or fictional for you, but belief in afterlife is a real thing outside fantasy. It depends on culture, religion, and personal belief.!<. . >!What I think of this question is the same I think for the ending: It should be left for the player to wonder. You can believe there is no "forgiving" if she is dead just as I can believe she forgives him in afterlife, as I do believe it in real life, even though I think the ghosts Sunny saw were mostly his imagination. No official scientific answer here, just good old symbolism and the eternal struggle of the human heart to find peace.!<. . "I've always agreed with William Faulkner—he said that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about." - GRRM
Thats a bold statement.. . Nothing in game implies that is the case nor does it fully denh it but there are more hints of subtle supernatural aspects then none at all
Here's a catch, think about the timing of Mari's appearance in headspace during the game. Sunny is still in his "denial" stage by this point, he wouldn't give himself a talk with his true perception of his sister and the stuff that happened if he was in denial. He wouldn't refer to the very thing he wants out of his thoughts. That would be a massive plothole in the development of that point in the game.
Basil saw Sunny's something though
To be cair if it was realistic he would be charged with manslaughter(this is very biased because I believe in ghosts)
I wonder why we didn't get to see more of Abbi. She's a quite important character, since she was one of the three great creatures, knew the truth and had a decent amount of influence on Sunny, but got banished for an unknown reason.
True, it would have been really nice to have seen more of ABBI and learnt the story especially with the initial art for her and the initial plans for her character
wait, did she have an initial art?
Look up “abbi initial art omori” you’ll see how Abbi initially looked and you could probably find information about it :). She used to be the main focus of the story with Omori! But as the story shifted it became what we know now. . Wish we knew more about her past and current character
Thank you, didn't know about this one. Also,I agree,she feels like a plot hole
Would’ve been great :)
I think the implications of ABBI are enough. It’s implied that she tried to break SUNNY/OMORI out of his self destructive cycle, and for that she was severely punished. Just seeing her messed up body at the bottom of OMORI’s abyss full of the things he’s personally sent there and ABBI’s poor cries for forgiveness tells all we need too now about her.
She's only a secret boss, we also don't know about the yellow cat but I don't care too much of her because she's only a secret boss and she was banished because she attenped Sunny to face the truth but he threw her to the abyss as a punishment
She had some really good potential of being a fully-fledged character, since she had influence on Sunny without, y'know, being Mari or another manifestation of his guilt, plus iirc she was his original imaginary friend before Headspace even existed. But instead she was simply thrown aside as yet another endgame boss for Omori route which is honestly sad.
isn't the yellow cat the giant cat figure on the kids tree house in headspace?
##justiceforabbi. . ##freeabbifromomori
I think that's a fair point but I sort of appreciate the mystery. This entity locked away in the deepest abyss, I kind of like being able to speculate over having more detailed information.
yessss agreed!!! though i kinda like the mystery aspect
The 1st one we’ll never know… but I feel we can be quite sure the 2nd one due to the strong evidence… especially as the “chopping tree” event has to be from some experience or thought that sunny had, with the tree missing in real life too…
I'd love to know why the demons found around headspace are all given names, are they people who previously had significance in Sunnys life are they people who tried to comfort him? They aren't just monsters each is an individual given an identity and id like to know why.
You mean the different Somethings like Dorothi, Merci, etc? Apparently they were Sunny's imaginary friends that got "corrupted" due to Black Space.
If that's the case what put the 3 great creatures above the rest?
It's not exactly explained, but maybe they were the three "favourite" imaginary friends for Sunny. Dorothi and the others weren't as important to him.
They all end with i's like Omori, curiously.
Probably mix up of invented and people he meet, because in the park all of the creatures that are there are real people in the real world of Omori, and sunny probably mixed up names of people he knew or headed of
This was the main part I was struggling with though, as its classified in the files/world as a blackspace 2, with 5 new locations that we’ve never been before… would those doors just be what Omori chose to hide, or would they be new depths of Sunny’s mind that we shouldnt explore (yet)
I don't understand which doors you are talking about. You can enter them all, some being locked in bs2 just depends on whether you explored them before or not 
I sent a link to what the wiki refers to further down this thread, but it seems like a form of conclusion was reached anyway :)
Yes, basically every door that you did not explore the first time you are in bs will be locked once you enter bs2. That's why they sometimes appear and sometimes not
There's singing inside Sunny's house?
Maybe. I decided to give myself the creeps tonight and sat and listened to both sounds in Sunny's and Aubrey's houses.. . The voice in Sunny's house sounds like some kind of high-pitched singing, and when it's reversed it kind of sounds like "it'll be alright". [Here's]() a link to a topic that has the reversed sound in the comments. The voice definitely belongs to a girl, though.. . Aubrey's house sounds more like there's two voices talking, the words just beyond comprehension to me. Or maybe one voice wavering between two different tones, but it's more... metallic? I almost want to say it's the same as in Sunny's house, but it definitely doesn't feel that way to me. Sunny's house has weird singing while Aubrey's is more of a conversation, I think.. . So my running crackpot theory right now is this: The voice in Sunny's house is the haunting echo of Mari singing, and Aubrey's house has the haunting echoes of her parents talking about something.
Thanks for having more courage than me lol. I actually like that theory a lot. Ultimately I think a lot of this kind of stuff is kind of just put in the game for ambience or other gameplay reasons since a lot of developers aren't quite that meticulous with their own gameplay world and potential pieces of symbolism.
It probably is meant to just creep players out, realistically. . . Also I was incredibly wrong earlier because the voice in Aubrey's house is the exact same in Sunny's so... whoops.
Sunny would have been going through some uhhh... "life changes" during those 4 years, after all... so we can't say those "less than wholesome" reasons are completely unfounded, unfortunately.
lets just say those tissues aren't just for wiping your sorrows away
Well they could still be, just don't think about why it's called white space


Well, Something behind Sunny was originally Basil's justification for Mari falling, when Sunny looked back at, *the results*, he started seeing Something behind him. . >!As we see Something behind Sunny and around Basil from Sunny's eyes, it is completely possible that Something looks different for Basil and we just don't know it, in fact, him naming it Something might be precisely because he can't see it clearly, since it, y'know, doesn't exist!<. . Edit: as for how Basil's Something pulls Sunny and his Something closer, well, tactile hallucinations are a thing, although from what I know, they are more rare
I’d say it’d be a LOT of loops. Sunny had 4 years to stay in Headspace so that’s a pretty long time, and I don’t know if this holds true but >!I think the gang’s journey was supposed to end around when they were stuck in Humphrey’s stomach/battle and endlessly fight there until dead thus why there were skeletons around the place, which is the gang. But that was prevented because in the True Route Sunny was able to reconnect with his friends and likely break that cycle.!< That said, after the >!Humphrey fight in regular cycles though,!< it loops again and maybe they wake up back at their tree stump. Not sure what happened to the other loops, maybe they were stored somewhere in Black Space? HS Basil may be taken out of the equation if it related a lot to Sunny’s trauma in the other loops, so Stranger may still exist even in the other loops, but who knows. It seems nobody remembers the other timeloops (perhaps other than us) which is why I speculate maybe it’s stored somewhere in Black Space, or just simply like a world restart. Idk.
Everything in headspace is inspired from Sunny’s real life, so I would want to know where did Abbi come from in real life, but i’m not sure if that’s already been answered.
It's highly supposed she was Tako-chan, an anime girl with 2 tentacles on her head and 1 tentacles replacing her right arm. This was an old idea we can actually see in OMORI's webcomic.. . Edit : Tako-chan was probably SUNNY's imaginary friend, and her design is probably based from ""anime""
I actually made a theory that the room with the cat butler encapsulates the message of Omori. Mewo represent Sunny, that has been "very, very bad" and Omori represents... well, Omori. Omori has the option to painfully kill Sunny but that is not the solution to getting out of that hellish state: the solution is killing Omori himself.
*spoilers!*. . 1. What are the red hands? They’re used a lot but never really explained.. 2. Why are there barely any consequences when Sunny stabs Aubrey? The fact that she barely seems hurt and doesn’t even go to the hospital or call the cops was so weird.. 3. Did Sunny’s parents know what happened to Mari? It seems like they might have. The one scene with his dad saying “you’re not my son,” and the fact that his mother is away right before them going through a move, a time where he’d need her support the most. Also, why did they let him stay inside for four years, seemingly without getting him therapy or any kind of help? Why did his father leave?
1. The most plausible explanation for the red hands is simply that they come from >!the expression "being caught red-handed" or simply from the notion that Sunny has blood in his hands!<. . 2. Sunny has a knife but A. He doesn't stab her, he slashes her which, considering his weak body, would probably make the attack a lot weaker and B. Aubrey probably doesn't call the cops cus she is like, the troublemaker in town and she doesn't want cops at her place
1. Pretty sure the symbolism there is that there's blood on Sunny's hands. Especially since he pushed her... with his hands.. . 2. Had to have just grazed her. Likewise, nobody seems to question Sunny dousing a bunch of kids in pepper spray. There's a bigger question about just how delinquent the delinquents are, since of course a gang isn't gonna involve the fuzz... but then they're consistently shown to just be kids.. . 3. For why they let him stay indoors, I think you'd have to look into the hikikomori phenomenon more generally. I mean, this is something that happens in the real world. Maybe the parents (in the real world) feel helpless? As for the parents, the other evidence they knew is, during the dream about the truth, his mother says something about not losing her son too.
whether or not headspace is a "3rd party" magical force that has existed for thousands of years or if the entire thing was just born from Sunny
My theory is that the “idea” of headspace has existed for thousands of years, but sunny was the first one that actually manifested it and turned it into something
>!why didn't sunny's mom come to the hospital during the true ending!<. . >!why are the hikikomori black space secret beta characters still in the game!<. . >!why is there a random gravestone in the graveyard that doesn't bring up a text box and just makes a barely audible jingle!<. . does boss represent anyone?. . what's the importance of blue girl?. . why did every single faraway dungeon except the recycultist lair get scrapped?. . and most importantly. . where does the crossant go
Might seem like an odd question… but im not referring to “post ending” events or what happened in the time Sunny was indoors. . I just mainly wanna know about things that are unexplained

Personally, I always theorized that they were Sunny's imaginary friends who he got rid of when Omori was created. It makes sense, seeing as Inko isn't even in the game, and Tako, Meido, and Uni only appear in Blackspace.
One of the three great creatures (presumably one of Sunny's imaginary friends that he liked more than others) that got banished to the abyss presumably for telling Sunny to forgive himself and to face the truth. . She was referred to as "the wisest" and originally actually played a big role in the game, but then OMOCAT changed her mind
99% sure he exists in his own timeline he felt wayyy too adult to have been sunny.
what happend after hikki? did sunny go to a new school? is he still dreaming about head space?
It’s assumed that he’s still dreaming about headspace and lives a new life, and never acknowledges the truth. It’s shown through how he simply defeats the 3 phobia bosses instead of overcoming his fears.
>!The credits of that route have police sirens in the background, which IMO could imply that Sunny ended up killing himself anyway. But that's obviously just speculation!<
I figured the sirens were there because Basil would have killed himself this day in True / Sunny Route if Sunny doesn't save him.
Well… as unfortunate as it is, the number of murder/manslaughter cases that are “solved” in real life… arent the best in %… when questioning the moral standards of Sunnys parents compared to how Sunny is as a person, may provide a hint towards they’d have the skills to cover it up… of course this is all speculation, so it is a mystery how they did it
Interesting thought, that's very possible as sunny's dad is out of the picture
I believe in quite a few US states you can choose not to have an autopsy done for a suicide. Especially if I remember correctly some Christians denominations prohibit things like autopsy. And since Sunny's family lives near a church, it could be interpreted as them being Christian and not having the autopsy done.
"murderous intent"!?. . Also I feel like that red-handed thing is kind of dumb because. . 1. The hands are white. . 2. Like every single dark thing in the goddamn game symbolizes guilt and Sunny hating himself, can't we have something different
Woops meant to cover the spoilers for other people lol. I might just take that part out because looking at it now doesn't really make much sense actually since it was ultimately an accident. The hands do have red outlines though so I think they are connected to the alleged red space. We also got the really big throne like ones that are straight up all red.. . You have to understand that Sunny has essentially been stewing in the guilt for 4 straight years and headspace itself is basically his way of repressing everything even if it originally was a way for him to play with his friends even while sleeping. The whole game itself is an allegory for how a person might go through guilt and shame following a horrific act/accident so it's not really surprising that this kind of stuff is steeped into the game world.
I never said the hands weren't from red space, they are. . Okay, yeah, I fucking understand the plot of the game, but HAKDJDdorkejffjrjfjKEJEKEJEJDJJDGkdkdjfjfjdjdjd. . Also the spaces represent his mind itself. . And having red space represent the same thing that everything else in the game represents better is just fUCKING EKEJRJJRFNFJFJNDMFMFkskdjfjfmfmKDKEK
Headspace. We know basically everything about how Sunny/Omori uses it, but there's also dialogue that implies it's had different owners over the years. I think it's often overlooked by the fandom and i'd like to see it be talked about and have more theories
Hard to say, I have always found it interesting that certain characters in headspace refer to Sunny as Dreamer, implying they have either gone through all his regular memories and know they are essentially in a dream simulation, or have omniscient powers linking themselves to the real world. It also implies he isn't the first or necessarily the last. I say sunny because they always talk to the player/Sunny through Omori.
What is the dialogue that implies it had different owners?
Omoris knife represents his hold over Sunny, when it's sharp at the beginning Omori basically is Sunny, and it dulls over the course of the game as Sunny gets closer to the truth.. . Black Space 2 areas are likely the fractured versions of previous black space iterations since our journey through the game is not the first time headspace is "rebooted".. . The Big Yellow Cat directly watches over the friends room in the forest. I think that it is actually pretty important and likely it serves as Omoris way of resetting Headspace and is also complacent or even opposed to Sunnys guilt and shame. I think it knows that headspace will likely permanently dissolve (or move to a new owner) once Sunny figures out the truth and that everything in it will cease to exist. There isn't a lot of hard evidence for any of this but would explain why it's considered "the favorite" as it serves to allow Sunny to run away from the truth.. . How terrifying would it have been if we had to fight the Big Yellow Cat as a something variant though? I always thought it kind of looked creepy.
Experiment 667
Abbi was Sunnys imaginary friend and it is speculated that she was banished to black space for acting as a voice telling sunny to forgive himself after the events leading him to shut himself away
Definitely discovered by Sunnys parents first. It's possible the group may have seen the ambulance taking away the body since they planned to meet up before the recital. I think the injuries from the fall would be obvious even 20-30 minutes following the fall so getting a good look would have put Sunny and Basil's story in jeopardy.
In black space while finding the key faris(sunny) comes across something.. The something says over and over that he loves faris(sunny). Which made me think if the something is part of mari? Or is it the metaphor for faris's (sunny's) bipolar disorder.
Does sunny prefer minecraft or terraria? What are his opinions on ww1 and 2?
He prefers Blackjack, the only computer game he has. I imagine he barely learned about WW1 and WW2 since it's implied he left school and the world wars are typically explored in middle/high school.
I wonder what the purpose of headspace is for other Dreamers and whether Basil has his own headspace or not since he can see Sunny's Something as well.. . My headcanon is that headspace is simply the marker of someone who is gonna have to deal with some severe trauma and has some level of construction rules controlled by something other than the Dreamer themselves. My evidence is that headspace clearly tailors itself to the user rather than being outright created by them. A lot of Mr Outbacks and the Branch Corals dialogue implies that Sunny isn't necessarily the first, last, or only owner of Headspace. Perhaps the 3 great beings (Yellow Cat, Abbi, and Humphrey) are not necessarily part of the Dreamer's creations even if they are somewhat tailored to them.
What’s sunny looking at on the laptop
Where does Sunny live and where is his new house after completing the secret good ending?  . (I am not receiving anyones adress)
Oh sure I understand, I'm just saying that Sunny attacked his friend with a knife, which is Always a dangerous thing.

Sunny must go. Not only for the integrity of this sub, but for the future of our children. KILL THAT CHILD.
KILL SUNNY
Sunny
Gtfo sunny LMAOO
here's a plan we kill sunny because...  . because..  . sunny
No one is voting sunny…but gotta go with him
Live Sunny reaction:. . 
same, >! also because if you do the true route knife ending, she already talked to sunny and maybe even wanted to try to get together, then when the others find out sunny AND basil had committed suicide that night. she would be spiraling into depression and may even end up killing herself, !< but thats just speculation.
What made you say that >!she wanted to get together with Sunny!<
i prefer the classic sunny x therapist
Lmao
Fuck. I gotta go finish this game. Didn’t even know it had multiple endings. I was being a very good friend in my playthrough.
feel bad for you , go and get the other 3 endings
Oh I never got any endings. I had just finished an area that was a junkyard, iirc, then I kind of burnt out.
Acute, if Sunny has anything to say about it
Ayyyyy
a big part of why she was so bitter towards sunny was because his mental withdrawal mirrored her mother's. . she broke down sobbing when sunny confessed the truth, because anger wasn't enough to cope
>!she was dangerously close to ending up in the exact same situation as sunny. Really, all you need to have an accident like that is the wrong place and wrong time. It's kinda scary honestly. Life is shockingly fragile!<
>!Yes… Thankfully Sunny prevented it.!<. . All these kids need hugs.
>!I thought it was Hero? Sunny would have drowned too if they didn't have quite frankly the stupid amount of luck they did.!<
My mistake. I misremembered it. >!Sunny did jump, but would have drowned if it weren’t for Hero.!<
During the sleepover at Basil's house, she wanted to ask if she could go with Sunny. She probably also knows that Sunny's father abandoned him.
: LACK OF FATHER FIGURE?. . : LACK OF FATHER FIGURE?
Sunburn—Sunny and Aubrey. . Sunflower—Sunny and Basil. . Suntan—Sunny and Kel. . Kelbrey—Kel and Aubrey. . Sunset—Sunny and Hero. . HeroMari—Hero and Mari. . Suncest—Sunny and Mari. . Those are all the ones I know the names of. My personal preference is Sunburn, which is Sunny and Aubrey.
Suncest just shouldn’t exist.
It does, and I had to acknowledge it.
are you agreeing with me, or are you saying it *should* exist?
I’m agreeing with you.
Oh thank god! Sorry about the confusion.
Yeah. The closest I get to actually shipping it (which I don’t) is just Sunny and Mari cuddling while watching a movie or something.
Sunset and suncest are cursed
Don't forget Sunrise: Sunny and therapy
pretty sure Sunny and Kel is Suntan
Ah. Then maybe Sunset is Sunny and Hero.
thank you very much 
She’s the same height as Sunny, but her bow makes her look taller than him.
She marries sunny
Best headcanon fr
After she grows up, she'd either become a youth counselor or take care of bunnies at an animal shelter. Or she'd just work at Walmart.  . . After the truth, she'd get closer to Kel than anyone else since everyone else was out of the picture. They'd still make fun of each other and banter a lot, but in this way where they just uniquely understand each other and see through the other's bullshit. She and Hero would also probably get closer, too. It'd take her a while to trust Sunny or Basil again, but eventually she'd grow to love them again, having a sorta relaxed, casual dynamic with Sunny and looking out for Basil to make up for what she did to him.   . . She really saw Mari as an older sister figure before she died and sorta saw the others like siblings, too, since in her shitty family, she probably always wished she had siblings. Like Hero as an older brother or Sunny as a younger one.
She has romantic dreams with Sunny.
Ha, that would be cute. You could write a bunch of dream sharing and dream exploring fanfictions with that. In fact I think I read one called Dream Date not too long ago.
yes
It reminds me of a fanfic where it's revealed that Aubrey dreamed of Sunny Modermo wearing cat ears.   .    .    .    .    . And the funny thing is that the fanfic is not even a sunburn fanfic
She's much taller than Sunny at the veginning of the game but as years go by and sunny takes better care of himself she'd just see him skyrocket and call it bull (She's glad Basil is still the shortest)
I can see this happening. I also imagine after therapy, Sunny starts working out 
she probably smokes or very straight edge and makes the gang do straight edge. . . this may  be more sunny, but since we are  seeing sunny pov, being only headspace for so long he block swears. So by sunny pov we don’t see swears, but really Aubery swearing every other sentence.. . (Semi joking) She actually pretty good at carptnering because she has to fix house herself.
MAKING THE MOTHER OF ALL HEADCANONS HERE SUNNY CANT FRET OVER EVERY SPOILER
. She has a torn up picture of Sunny she fixed after the good ending
she likes sunny or kim or both. . anarchist. . surprisingly really religious. . and Italian descendent
im saving snuuy because hes kinda cute
flair checks out...
Bro...
but snuuy cute!!
Aaaaa though choice… . . but I’m hoping Sunny wins because he’s kinda relatable.
RELATABLE?!
Probably because she play’s the violin like Sunny or she has/had a big sis or she is a shut in like him (I am running out of ideas help)
or he helped reenact “ayo the pizza here”
I feel like everyone accidentally killed their siblings before right?
Well when I was a child and my sister was just a few months old I tried to suffocate her with a pillow so technically yes 
Pray you don’t have a older sister
Sunny is better
IF WE LET SUNNY WIN HE WILL FINALLY GET THERAPY  . COME ON LET HIM WIN
Precious snuuy needs to win 🥹 (man I like kel but I like my snuuy a bit more)
Same here 
yes
The only one who's allowed to hurt Sunny is >!SUNNY!<. Nobody else.
Sorry Sunny
Sunny has to go I’m sorry
NEVER
tbf tho snuuy does steal 20 bucks back from him (if u choose to)
Bro if sunny doesn't win imma have depression
If sunny doesn't win then I'm >!using a rope on myself!<
My husband Sunny needs to win
You see Snuuy kinda looks like me so...
C'mon Sunny fans, rise up! Remember, the game wouldn't happen without him! WE CAN'T LET HIM DOWN
COME ON SUNNY YOU CAN DO IT!!! YOU ARE MY MOST RELATABLE CHARACTER SECOND TO NO ONE!!! YOU MUST WIN!!!
And there can only be one! SNUUY GANG
Yesssss
SUNNY!!!
GET EM SUNNY!!! KILL THE TALL PEOPLE 🗣🗣
Just shoot me already. . As much a i hate to choose, my boy snuuy is just too cute for me to vote him out
Nah Sunny needs to go. 
SUNNY FANS UNITE!
guys im gonna be honest.. . sunny is kinda boring
L

From what i've seen of the top comments i can see who is winning, it's another of those the funny meme character wins, so yeah sunny fans we've lost
Snuuy must win! All hail Snuuyyy 
ALL HAIL
I'm saving Snuuy.. Cause unfortunately . I relate to him a little too much.
# SUNNY FANS!. . # WE MUST RISE UP!. . . . 
Sunny has to go.
...I'm sorry, sunnys got to go
Save the Snuuy
SHADOW SUNNY MONEY GANG!
Sunny gotta go
Is it wrong that I genuinely want Sunny to win? He's the lil skrunkly and I kin him. I'm gonna make so many people mad I'm sorry 💀
How the fuck did sunny makeit this far?
Oh yeah no i am, I love Snuuy. I just didnt realize this community loved him so much
Maybe im just seeing this only from the fanfic reader perspective, but you really dont ever see sunny in a bad light in most reviews of him. “Boring” is just the most common insult for his character, so id say its pretty light. Anyway, you are indeed an auby fan.
I also love red, itchy skin caused by UV light from the sun 
Why did it take me this long to realize you aren’t saying Sunny, but Sunburn
LOL
sorry sunny
vote sunny or no more canon
Srry snuuy u gotta go 😊
Sunny 100%
SAVE SUNNY
DIE SNUUY

Sunny
SUNNY LEAVE PLEASE
SUNNY SWEEEP!

Sorry but snuuy has to go
sunny’s gotta go 
SUNNY SWEEP
Sunny. Am sorry.
Sunny shall perish
Sunny/omori geander fluent confirmed
Why yes, i also love the Grindr Flute!
> I still don't know why Sunny made his currency clams of all things. . Clams is a slang term that used to refer to coins. It's extremely outdated and might be USA related only.
Thank you! . I would never have figured that out
This brings another question up, What race is sunny's family? East Asian?
He's holding Sunny's violin too.
no Sunny’s still holding his violin. They’re just holding hands ig.
Of course hes right by Sunny
Just saying >!but sunny have his right eye cut from the image.!<
I'd say these things probably should all be spoilered.. . >!And I did read the shouting in the truth album mostly in the context of Sunny just destroying his violin. The gift that was specifically emphasized everybody pouring a shitton of work into. That seems like a fairly reasonable thing to get angry over, even as a normally more understanding and loving big sister. !<. . >!And seeing how overall non-verbal Sunny is, I just assume that he never really put his foot down and openly said how much he struggled and how he didn't want to participate in that duet. Yeah, Mari should've ideally seen that her brother is struggling, and should've started that conversation. I'm not saying she acted perfectly, but I do think she never was unreasonable or outright wanted to harm her brother for her goals. !<
Spoilered the text, thanks for the tip. . . And yeah, I do agree that she should’ve dealt with the situation a lot better.
If it was data mined from the game and not shown to the player, it is irrelevant to the final story. If it wasn't deemed inappropriate to the author's vision, it wouldn't have been cut. . . >!But it isn't her "fault" regardless. It was a thing that happened, many people had hands in what occurred. The friends bought Sunny the violin. Sunny could have spoken up about the pressure. Mari could have not pushed so hard. *Sunny* could have not pushed so hard. Sunny or Basil could have called an ambulance instead of taking her to bed in hopes that she'd recover. A lot of contributions.!<
Ok, the Datamine doesn’t count.. . But she still admits that she was too hard on him. . Plus. . > >!Sunny or Basil could have called an ambulance instead of taking her to bed in hopes that she'd recover.!<. . >!In the truth sequence it says “This person is no longer breathing”. Calling an ambulance wouldn’t really do anything!<. . To be honest, Mari should’ve handled the situation much better, but the ***majority*** of fault is to her.
The truth sequence is in Sunny's head, and he was a scared child. She may have just been breathing too shallowly for him to realize. . . I'd personally say this was entirely accidental, and "fault" shouldn't be pointed at anyone, but responsibility for the circumstances is shared pretty evenly among a few characters. . . But this being literature, there is no right or wrong answer, only different answers with different supporting evidence, and different interpretations based on our own personal experiences.
that's sunny
Ohhhhhh ok the flower and the expression threw me off
I think sunny will win this
My dad votes sunny
First play through I gave him a very light German accent and I do not know why. It just kind of stuck whenever I imagine him speaking.. . Also, like another user said, I didn't immediately give him a high pitched voice, had a nice baritone (upper baritone but still baritone). Most playthroughs I've watched the player gives him the highest pitch voice they can muster upon seeing his character art, always seemed strange to me.. . I don't believe his usual behavior is anywhere close to how it is in the game sequence. We only interact with his during a three day period wherein he is planning on killing himself. I think he's typically quite calm and happy. I don't think he was constantly on the verge of tears or riddled with anxiety, but was instead quite happy and outgoing (All of his official fanart has him smiling and looking like he's encouraging others, the calendar project specifially). Headspace characters are Sunny's friends as Sunny remembers them, and headspace Basil seems to be quite happy, calm, thoughtful, and friendly, I think that's the real him. I think it sucks he'll always be remembered as a depressing character because we only interact with him during the worst period of his life.
>!No little German boy!  Don’t go into the unfathomably black cave!!<. . >!Mein Gott!  Zees is ein cave full of Verschollentrauma!!<. . (I do not know german)
I'm German, yet i have no clue what that last word is supposed to mean.
>! Verschollenes Trauma? Im Sinne von verdrängtes Trauma? !<
>!Wir haben das Wort nicht mal so in unserem Duden stehen!<
Ich weiß, das war nur meine Vermutung, was es vermutlich heißt.
>!its what google translate said ‘forgotten trauma’ was!<. . this is why i don’t use google translate for anything too serious kgjfvjdj
Good night
almost.
i did improv voice acting on my first playthrough and i gave him the deepest voice just because i can
Perfect 😆
This is definitely the right thread for this headcanon. The high-pitched voice headcanon just kind of stuck with me, and apparently 90% of the fandom.
I gave him a British voice
I've always pictured him with the voice of the Japanese voice actor for Attack on Titan's Armin.
I couldn't agree more...poor flower boi got bad reputation because of trauma
i want to upvote this but it 420 likes morally i cannot
These need to be canon
>I think it sucks he'll always be remembered as a depressing character because we only interact with him during the worst period of his life.. . I actually didn't really like his Headspace version, and his realworld version made him go from my least favorite character to my favorite character.
I would agree his headspace version was a good character, but I think it proves that Sunny thought of him in a positive way, and gave him character traits that indicated his anxiety/depressed real world self wasn't normal to his typical behavior. . . Headspace Basil is in the game so little that it's hard to really judge him at all other than to say that his overwhelmingly positive traits would likely of grown old. I have my own theories on why basils defining character trait in sunnys mind is happiness rainbows and sunshine but I am curious to hear what it is about him you disliked?
>but I am curious to hear what it is about him you disliked?. . It's not really something I could explain, he just felt off. He was too nice all the time and it felt wrong. Once I learnt he was just a version of Basil made based on how Sunny saw him I understood why he was the way he was.. . I just don't like characters who are too nice all the time, maybe cause it feels like they're faking it, based on real life interactions I've had with that kind of people
Did you watch fruits basket  because he also gave me momiji vibes 
Never heard of it, but "fruit basket" was my unwanted nickname in high school. Good times. . . Tell me of this momiji?
Great anime - fantastic character with the same general vibe/ look/ and fashion sense . . Absent parents and trauma
"Play fortnite and drink cola, Yippeee!"
I give him a light Greek accent lol

”Sunny, we have to plant!”
>!I'm not in danger Sunny, I AM THE DANGER!!, A man opens his door and is pushed out of the stairs, do you think I'm the one who opens the door? No, I'm the one who knocks!<
tbf I didn't think anything of his hobbies or feminine interests at first. But I got no heterosexual explanation for the "perfect, just like Sunny" line
- He's from the Netherlands. . - He >!hung Mari's body!< because he >!didn't want Sunny's friends to see him as a monster since that friend group was really all he had!<. . - Like someone said earlier he's actually really uncomfortable to be around when he's miserable. . - He would never get with Sunny (or really anyone in the friend group besides maybe Kel) because of all the shit he put them through. . - He didn't know >!Sunny confessed during the true ending!< and has a massive panic attack when Sunny tells him. . - At one point after the good ending he asks Hero and Aubrey to kill him
He’s just Sunny’s best friend, not interested in him romantically.
youre very brave
…thank you?
He >!did stab out Sunny’s eye 🤔!<
Well, he just wanted to show Sunny a different perspective of everything happening around them :)
He doesn’t exist. Sunny created him, just like Omori.
Wow, this is just sad… but then things in the real world did seem too good before the pizza came.
Why does this sounds even worse than what actually happened(probly cuz it is)
Sunny is Kris
Thing is that at best the others forgive Sunny because what he did was an accident. What Basil did however wasn't, and yes I know that people love to throw that "you expect this panicking little kid to take the perfect course of action in that situation?", but he couldn't possibly have picked a worst way to help cover for Sunny
Sunny helped him with the cover up, so the argument is invalid. Unpopular opinion, >!Sunny is just as guilty for the hanging as Basil!<. . . Unpopular headcanon: >!Basil has a spider as a pet to get rid of the pests. He doesn't have anymore, because Sunny killed it after the incident and this was also the same day when he ruined the photos from Basil 's photo Album!<
Except not really though? Not only did Basil do all the work aside from carrying Mari outside, the truth album text says Sunny was already dissasociating after taking Mari to bed. If it hadn't been for Basil, Sunny's parents would have probably found him still sitting next to the bed in his room
Good bot
Isn't all of this technically spoiler? Shouldn't it be all marked?. . >!Sunny dragged Mari down to the backyard after he was convinced by Basil to help him and Sunny did nothing to stop him. The truth album is unused and thus not Canon to that event, since it's not in the main game and even so, Sunny was merely telling it himself so that he can deny that his sister died because of him. He knew what was going on, but he wanted to deny it and the same truth album has him be happy about the hanging all the while slowly realizing the reality of it.!<. >!If it had not been for Basil, Sunny would have not been able to do anything afterwards and would have had a psychological breakdown far worse than what we have seen, he could have killed himself.!<.  >!Not that what Basil did was good, but at the very least he was there for Sunny while no one was there for him and that is something no one can take away from him!<.
>!I think you are trying too hard to blame on all of this on Basil, only so that the main character looks way more innocent and forgivable for having helped with such a monstrous plan. Sunny wasn't simply in shock, he was in despair and afraid of what could happen if others find out what happened, so he wanted to lie about it to protect himself, thus he helped Basil cover it up. If Sunny is nothing but a bystander who was forced into doing it, he would have not carried her to the backyard despite knowing well what happened. Sunny didn't block it all out immediately, that is in the unused texts, it's more like him trying to deny it, like you would do if something like that happened to you. He was aware enough for him to do something, as he carried her, for instance, and never told anyone about it. No one said that Basil didn't hang her, but that he had an accomplice, who knew what was going to happen. Besides, I said that the text described Sunny has having felt a certain joy over the hanging, not my personal interpretation. Additionally, as we find out, Basil wasn't exactly in his right mindset, since he actually thought that an evil ghost killed Mari, so how sane he was when he did that is left up to interpretation.!<. . >!Speaking of which, the reason why Basil didn't say anything was so that Sunny would be hated and abandoned by his friends and from anyone else, had they known what happened and he himself doesn't believe Sunny did that, he denied that for a long time. He was under the delusion that an evil ghost haunts him, so he felt a huge sense of helplessness made worse by Sunny abandoning him, which drove him to suicide with the addition of his Grandma passing away. It was less a "no one shall know the truth, I take it with me to my grave, muahahahha" and more like "Sunny, it's impossible, there is no way out of this, we have to end our lives". Sunny however does knew what really happened and can tell the truth, Basil cannot do that as evident with his belief in something. Basil isn't the man responsible for everything, if that is how we were meant to see it, then the idea of Sunny lying and running away from his problems would be illogical, and it isn't as Omori himself doesn't say that Basil lied, he said that Sunny lied to protect himself, which is true.!<. . I feel like that just because you are a protagonist, you are not the most morally superior person ever, especially with so many evil ones out there, but Sunny isn't evil and neither is Basil.
i actually kinda agree. this will be the eternal dispute in the r/OMORI
I'M NOT A SUNNY KINNIE!!!! 
he’s slightly taller than sunny
The way Basil acts during the 3 days definitely isn’t how he acts all the time, even after everything. It was pretty obvious he was nervous seeing sunny again only because it had been so long since sunny had left his house, also he had been getting picked on by the others (aubrey and her friends ex idk if there were others than them) and also had the burden of his something tormenting him. But there also had to be times where he wasn’t seeing something (maybe it just got progressively worse of course) but perhaps in the beginning he only saw something as like portrayed nightmares of the night (with the trauma) but I saw someone saying how they were in the HS was how sunny remembered them but I think it was a bit exaggerated as well. Because obviously aubrey probably didn’t flirt with him at age 12, rather his projection of her in HS was his crush projected onto the HS version. So perhaps Basil still had a bit of anxiety when he was younger, it just wasn’t as prevalent as it is during the 3 days.
this was a joke that me and a friend made so this whole thing is a joke don't take it too seriously.  . . . >!basil is secretly gay and is in love with sunny so he talked to sunny into not wanting to do the big show making him destroy his violien and with that made it look like mari was not a good sister at all causing sunny to push her down the stairs and kill her so he can frame it like a suicide and get sunny all to himself but it back fired and made sunny hide in his house letting basil to think of a plain to kill him and sunny so they can be together in death!< but thats just a theory A GAME THEORY thanks for reading
Wth thats actually an accurate Matpat moment
cant make it a game theory without skirting around the point for 10 minutes
uueehhggfgh sunny help uehghughg im on fuckign life suprot
"Uueehhoooohh **I'M FUCKING DYING!**"
He actually calls Sunny “sonny”, but nobody can tell the difference since they’re pronounced the same
Idk if this is super unpopular but I hc after the true ending he and Sunny have to stick around in the hospitals psych ward for a while because they had to explain the injuries and one of them let it slip they were ‘fighting because they saw each other’s somethings’, which is probably better than them both getting criminal records.. Also idk if unpopular hc but? Autism. Autism and psychotic depression but he’s just always depressed so always experiencing psychotic symptoms (but gets a lot better following true ending) that’s my hypothesis
Had Basil not walked in on Sunny and  that day, he would have done what he finally worked himself up to do- try(on some fake nervous uwu shit) to get alone with Sunny in the treehouse. Do with that information what you will

It was a gift from sunny
SPOILER. . . . . . . . . >! The whole hanging her thing makes no sense, but the plot stays pretty solid without it.. That's my headcanon, after she got mad at Sunny and started throwing hands, she fell, they called the ambulance and that's it. !<. . Ah, and he fucks cacti.. . Edit: I learnt how to spoiler text on reddit
Yeah but then sunny and basil would get arrested if they called an ambulance
Why?. Sunny just tried to free himself from Mari's aggression.. She fell and it was an accident.. . Edit: aggression is a bit exaggerated but you get the idea.
manslaughter is still a crime lol
Basil and Aubrey are actually dating and the whole bullying thing is just some weird role playing they like doing /s . . In all seriousness my most unpopular headcannon for him is that he actually straight, or at the very least isn’t into Sunny. I think his whole obsession with Sunny is less romantic and more because he thinks of Sunny as a innocent little brother that can’t do anything wrong. I’m pretty sure he refers to Sunny as the baby of the group in the photo album. . . I also think Basil’s parents are Bill and Hillary Clinton. His hair kinda matches with Hillary. It would explain why their never around, (to busy with politician stuff). And it would explain >! why his first instinct was to make Mari’s death look like a suicide. !<
(SPOILERS) . . >!My headcannon is that After the end of the true ending (where sunny tells the truth to the gang in the hospital) he started to get highlights of the color that was the off greenish color that he had in white space because he thought it fit him!<
Basil is abused and had low self esteem without his parents and his friends. He needs help mostly with Sunny and plants flowers to cope during the 4 years without Sunny.
Basil was never Sunny's best friend,Kel was. Also, Sunnyflower would realistically never happen after what happened to Mari + I think the ship is fucked up
He runs a very popular bloons channel with Sunny
basil isnt real. He’s just an imagination of sunny as sunny is lonely. NOT A SHIP! FUCK OFF!
He knowingly goes for the sweet shy character outfit, he’s actually really good at picking clothes and even helped Sunny go shopping at some point
i think they use they/her pronuns  . They use gardering as therapy and likeplaying animal crossing with sunny/omori
I genuinely have almost at least a hundred of these, some are jokes, some are silly self projecting some are serious and some are actually happy . . anyway have 50 Basil headcannins . . 1.  he has a stutter. 2. he has >!anxiety, bpd, ocd and autism!<. 3. Hates eye contact . 4. he argued and shouted at Polly one too many times and felt rlly guilty about it after so would shut himself in his room. 5. if she tried helping him with something he’d been stressing over he would get upset and say he could do it himself when he obviously couldn’t but eventually did. 6. he did not attend any music lesson in school, probably fell back a bit in school after the incident, his favourite subjects were english, languages and history. 7. broke his bones way too many times. 8. he despises hospitals for absolutely no reason. 9. his parents died when travelling, another family member paid for Polly and she used the excuse that they died but Basil knew damn well they died. 10. he can speak maybe 2 or 3 different languages. 11. he >!self harmed a lot over the four years sunny isolated himself not always in the most extreme way but when it got really bad he went to deep and screeched and Polly thought he probably got shot or smth!<. 12. He had been Anxious as a kid and had panic attacks but not often, mostly at school due to being bullied for being slightly more feminine compared to other boys. 13. wore hair bands on his wrists and when he got nervous would like pinged them against his wrist, one of his friends would hold his hand so he wouldn’t hurt himself too much. 14. probably a platonic kisser but stopped cause he thought he made his friends uncomfortable and scared they’d hate him and bully him. 15. smokes with Aubrey post good ending on the occasion . 16. Aubrey took the group to a rage room post good ending and Basil was 100% the most violent and screamed the most at shit but walked out looking like he didn’t just scream the most vile and horrid things while smashing and throwing stuff. 17. he has glasses. 18. hes colourblind. 19. he only writes with coloured gel pens or fountain pens with some silly ink colour. 20. owns about 1000 pins and a messenger bag to put the pins on to. 21. Has a spare shirt and toothbrush for whenever Sunny came over . 22. wrote rlly cringey fanfic when he was younger, when he found them years later he literally read a few lines then burnt them out if embarrassment . 23. Knew how to crotchet and knit. 24. he is the kind to have like really long and BOILING hot baths with bubbles and herbs and such. 25. he fainted a lot . 26. >!he struggled with eating due to throwing it up from anxiety so he resorted to just not eating or throwing it up himself, Polly knew but didn’t confront him but always gave him a cold drink and a hot chocolate or something whenever she heard him do it!<. 27. He hates public restrooms. 28. loves hugs but they have to be from specific people. 29. he hates science especially topic about the human body. 30. he denies stuff that’s so obvious like for example if Sunny were to ask abt his sh he’d be like ‘no, nothings there, no idea what your on about‘ when there’s really noticeable wounds. 31. he hated recovery . 32. he has a very specific routine and such and has to do it in the same order everyday . 33. he loses everything and gets mad at everyone until he finds it. 34. he age regresses but never told anyone other than his therapist and accidentally told Sunny while ranting about stuff. 35. he made jewellery and Aubrey and Mari taught him how to do it. 36. has his ears pierced. 37. probably been to multiple psychiatric institutions . 38. decent singer. 39. hes also decent at drawing but didn’t think it was that good so he didn’t do much with it but has a few sketchbooks and good art supplies he probably gave to Sunny or the church. 40. loves tea. 41. collects the most random-est of things. 42. transmasc or genderfluid. 43. local drug dealer/j. 44. probably has a really dark sense of humour. 45. Really awkward to be around but he warms up eventually . 46. a really good roller skater. 47. Hates being wet, like wearing wet clothes, having wet hair or anything like that if he isn’t having a bath or anything. 48. a really picky eater. 49. loves researching cultures and traditions and such. 50. probably would wear a small amount of makeup like lip gloss or white eyeliner specifically (not trying to like make him a femboy he seems like the kind to experiment with that stuff)
Imo they add depth to Sunny and the RW versions by contrasted how they all changed, especially Basil and Aubry. . . It’s really a great use of show don’t tell, that we don’t have to be told Kel hasn’t changed much and Aubry has we get to see how Sunny remembers them and how they are now, that said I do agree the RW counterparts are more interesting
Ikr! He’s literally the one who gets sunny out of the house and he’s by far the most thoughtful of the group. 
Sunny
>!Only by Sunny. I doubt anyone else could.!<
If we get really into it with the actually canonical character's power sets rather than rpg mechanics. . . . . The fun gang can reset the fight infinitely because determination . . . . . . The fun gang also have the player on their side. . . . . Kris and Susie also exist in their actual reality and can go beat up Sunny in the real world where Omori obviously has no power (and if you for a second tell me irl Sunny and Co. can go toe to toe with Susie even without factoring Kris then youre memeing the girl is a tiny t rex and the fighting experience from the dark world most likely caries over)
i mean sunny can just spam PERSIST and CALM down, and that'll make the fight infinite too
That doesn't work in actual physical fights. . . . . . . Like if you can't do that against any of the hooligans or Aubrey. . . . . . It's Sunny's way of fighting his inner demons. . . . . So it wouldn't factor into a physical confrontation
wait which run is the player doing in DTrune
Headspace gang.. . But if it was Faraway Town Snuuy and friends vs Light World Fun Gang, the Fun Gang would win despite being down a member.
Does sunny have the knife/spray or not?
Another relevant question is chapter 1 or 2 of DR? Given that Susie can easily break 150 with Rude Buster with a little farming, that can take out the headspace gang in 10 uses max.
Couldn't Sunny with persist stall indefinitely?
Persist cannot be used in real world battles
it depends if it actually works beacuse you just don't have an oppurtunity to use it
Hypothetically, Headspace *could* count as a Dark World if Sunny managed to create a Dark Fountain.
Not necassarily. From what we have seen, dark worlds are created by the environment and objects that is in the room. Not the mind of the person who created it. This is even proven by how when objects are moved (which are proven to be characters in one dark world) to a dark world room they turn back. Only possibility is if their was a headspace themed room.
More interesting question, who would win, sunny and friends or kris and Susie in the real world
**If** monsters still have magic in the real world then it would easily be Kris and Susie.
That’s a good point.. One small issue,there is a guy from Vice City who is searching for someone called Sunny because he putted him in prison for 15 years
Since this looks like it’s set in headspace, the Omori team would definitely win since it’s all an idealized self servicey dream made up by Sunny. If this was set in the real world, the Fun Gang would easily win because all of the main characters in Omori are twinks and Susie would just have to pick them up by the scruff of their necks and send them blasting off into space somewhere.
Nah man your asking the worng question. Who wins. Real world kris or sunny that's the reeeeeeeeal shit
>!Delta rune would probably win pacifist but lose in a fight. Omorii is sunny and is actively looking for an escape and would not want to resort to violence if given the chance (unless late game I guess since you’re forced to undergo trauma). Delta rune would make friends with the dream gang quickly and then probably all together convince omorri to talk things out.!<
depends what route, hikikomori route? omori would SLAP with red hands, vertigo, cripple and suffocate. sunny route? depends which versions, headspace would be a draw I'd say, but then again, omori was able to beat HUMPHREY. HUMPHREY SUCKS BRO. anyways, if it's the RW gang then the fun gang would absolutely massacre them, since yk, real children, UNLESS SUNNY HAS PERSIST, THEN SUNNYS GONNA SURVIVE, especially if he has a violin
Sunny is not “the best”.. . >!Sunny is a literal murderer who covered it up with his best friend!<. . Kel however, someone who’s always secretly cared about her and makes her laugh and smile, would probably be the best for her.
Sunny is enraged
And Sunny IS NOT Oragne Joe sexual
Doesn't she have a crush on sunny or am I imagining things
>!Before the incident? Maybe. After the incident? Not enough evidence is provided.!<
Maybe that's because they didn't think it was needed? Idk I don't really care if she's straight bi or gay
Based
Sunny liked her, but there's not really any proof that she liked him back
I interpreted it as Sunny projecting his crush on Aubrey onto the fantasised version of her.
Except Sunny. Sunny is bisexual. . And Hero is straight probably
Dude I hate enemies to lovers. However do you really think Sunny’s going to be in a healthy relationship right now?
her name is sunny, she got frustrated from practicing for the recital so she threw her piano down the stairs
guys, it's obviously sunny in a wig

Still dude that’s a tiny bit nasty
genderbend sunny
She’s like that because Sunny doesn’t know about any other hairstyle.
Fair enough.
Sunny parents I can’t see them doing that
Why? We know practically nothing about them
Unless Sunny cut his own hair in those 4 years, his mom did it
True
The actual omori boss fight in the sunny route
Sunny pointing a flashlight at his bed and seeing a Freddy toy plushie:. . 
Sunny should be fine, as i ***HIGHLY*** doubt those tubby animatronics could even ascend a flight of stairs, due to their large feet, their metallic forms, and most likely unbalanced robotic bodies (Entertainment Robots Are Not Meant To Contain Children). In the very case that one were to ***SOMEHOW*** climb those steps, sunny could simply recall the skill of "Pushing" and push the robotic prick down the flight of stairs, realistically causing some mechanical damage. Aside from Foxy, ***NONE*** of the robots show ***ANY*** athletic skill at all, and could thus ***EASILY*** be outmaneuvered by Sunny. Even if you disregard all of those factors, i doubt that Sunny would be foolish enough to forget that his door does NOT require power to stay closed. . . 
I mean, the Glamrock animatronics are capable of making a perfect bee-line for someone’s exact location regardless of stairs, elevator shafts, or even barricades, so maybe he might be cooked
Counterpoint. There's only one entryway above. Sunny could camp it and push them down whenever they try to go up. (unless they climb or they somehow teleport upstairs)
> Somehow teleport . . Standard Glamrock Chica activities
W Snuuy Strat, he'll be fine. 
Those Glamrocks do serve as a good challenge for Sunny. I'd suggest for him to enter Aubrey's house, obtain the appropriate amount of hoarder wastage to keep "Filth Chica" satisfied. Monty's nothing but a jealous little prick, far outshone by Sunny (geddit?), I'm sure a few plastic orbs originating from a ballpit will give the ***C R O C O D I L I A N*** PTSD. Freddy shouldn't be too picky with his friend choices, judging by the fact that he usually impregnates himself with a Gregory. If all else fails, i doubt that Hellmari would approve.
According to the original trilogy, they could easily go up and down stairs, and also weren’t easily pushed
oh no.
3 night's at Sunny's
I agree they do but also everyone basically call him perfect but thats more of just like his character. To me i think where Basil says the lines about Sunny through the flowers, its more important. He specifically refers to Sunny, not Omori, and call him comfortable and perfect. I wouldnt even say its deep at all, but i think its perfectly fine to say that its a shippable moment.
I don't recall anyone outside of the main cast calling hero perfect? Except maybe in headspace which is Sunnys own thoughts.nwhich speaking of headspace, Basil only says the lines about the flowers in headspace not in the rw. He never directly says these things himself
Mari refers to omori as Sunny in headspace a few times too tho. For obvious reasons what she says aren't things she has said irl. Nothing about what Basil or stranger says in headspace is confirmed to be said in the rw
I disagree i i think its fair to assume that is actually it. I think thats what most people in the sub call it. Either way shes a guiding force to help sunny wither way
There's zero proof that's the case, or that it is actually her guiding him. It's more accurate that it's sunnys subconscious in so,e way. If Mari really is guiding him, how is it Basil is also guiding him when he's clearly >!alive and well? Its not like his spirit can guide him!<

I think its more implied. Like his parents always idolize him more and everyone asks about it and all. They dont say perfect but Sunny has probably heard people call him perfect

Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.. . I have checked 1,094,093,105 comments, and only 215,235 of them were in alphabetical order.
>!Omori is a part of Sunny. This mean that Sunny wants Aubrey to love him!<. . 
>!Omori is a a part of him, but he is not him.Those feelings are in the past and belong there!<. . Also prequel memes are getting stale, like Sunny's romantic feelings for Aubrey.. .  is the future!. . Don't worry, everything is going to be okay!
>!Since when Basil showed any ***romantic*** feelings towards Sunny? Or the other way around? I only see friendship!!<. . Also I agree about prequel memes (but it's not like episode 7,8 and 9 have good memes and the Og triology is not so 'memeable')
There's Snuuy for everyone!. . 
Snuuy makes everything so Sunny 
 makes everything so  
He brings us a good morning!
He brings us a  morning!
 Is the day outside! He makes us happy and makes  grow!. . (I totally have the headcanon that Mari names him Sunny because the very moment when he was born, the Sun shined brighter than ever!)

PRAISE THE SNUUY NOW.. . (Sometimes I imagine what would be the main characters reaction to this fandom)
PRAISE THE SNUUY! . . (They would mostly think of us as wierdos with Basil having a panic attack and facing numerous death threats. Sunny would then use his knife to make those threats empty ones)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!!. . (And Sunny's reaction to us Sunny Enjoyers?)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (He would think of us as a bunch of wierdos who should spendtheir time more on something productive than worship him)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!!. . (Make sense)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (The other one is that he wouldn't mind this worship, because he isn't one to tell others whom to worship, so as long as they don't violate the rights of others. This is how I see Sunny be like in the good ending, when he overcomes >!his guilt of having killed Mari and lied about it!<)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (Or he would just embrace the cult)
PRAISE THE SNUUY !. . (He is no Sweetheart, he won't need stupid adoring fans to have any semblance of Self-Esteem. He ain't a narcissist.)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (I was not saying in a narcissistic sense, I was saying in a more meme like way)
PRAISE THE SNUUY !. . Ah ok, sorry. I just think Sunny isn't like Sweetheart, who would want to have a cult. He will not mind us, but he surely won't throw us into the dungeon or worse, into the walls of the Castle, where we live off from Tofu leftovers and old toast. Gross.
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (Thank god he's himself and not Sweetheart!)
PRAISE THE SNUUY !. . (That is why we love him, he is Sunny, and we all love him. He ain't a narc Donut. He is our Sunny!)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (I don't need reason to love him! Just because he's him I have a reason to love him!)
PRAISE THE SNUUY !. . (Me too!)
PRAISE THE SNUUY!. . (Good to know!)
This comment thread evolved from sunburn to “PRAISE THE SNUUY!” And I just love that about internet comment threads
Objection! While the possibility of Sunny crushing on Basil is definitely there and whole I do shop Sunflower, it is important to consider context and what the game is telling the player. . . Sunny's attraction to women is shown in Headspace far more than any possible attraction to men: Slime Girls and Perfectheart are far more explicitly attractive than Captain Spaceboy, who as far as I can remember is the only major humanoid male that could be seen as such. . . Additionally, it requires a lot of mental gymnastics to claim that by saying "Sunny looks at pictures of Aubrey, Basil points that out and asks if he has a crush as Sunny blushes" the game was telling the player that actually Sunny was crushing on Basil and couldn't correct him out of embarrassment.. . Again, love Sunflower, it's really cute, just don't particularly think it could work in canon without at least altering a few scenes.
Tbh from the game, what I thought that Sunny liked about Aubrey was the fact that she was so headstrong and idealistic. It's these sort of traits that he admires about her which he himself didn't possess as a shyer and more introverted person. >!I also think Sunny liked the fact that (despite) being the brash person she was, Aubrey was willing to show him a lot of sensitivity and sympathy compared to the other people in her life (for example we see that she's less likely to target him than Kel when they are fighting). She also tags alongside Sunny without making him uncomfortable when they are friends again.!<. . >!On the other side, one of Aubrey's biggest issues was having people brush her off or misunderstand her, so I think Sunny listening to her without judgement was a big deal for her (just like it was for Basil), especially when she was going through a lot of stuff with her home life (and we see people like Kel brush her off). In the final duet, the swings where he shares conversations with Aubrey are shown as one of Sunny's most important memories so obviously she does mean a lot to him.!< Not all these characteristics are exclusive to them only (like you said Basil appreciates Sunny's quietness and listening abilities as well among other things as you've pointed out, and he is Sunny's best friend).. . But overall, I think both Basil and Aubrey play important parts in Sunny's life. Is one more exclusively romantic than the other? Hell if I know lol. >!Sunny had a crush on Aubrey when he was younger but he was still a kid so who knows if it would last after everything that happened in the game. Maybe he hooks up with Basil instead lol. !<Depending on your personal interpretations and feelings, you can find one ship relates more to you than another. And the ending is so open ended that all possibilities are open. And I haven't even gotten to Kel and Sunny's relationship!. . Anyways keep headcanoning! I like hearing other people's thoughts whether they are reaches or not (sorry about the other comment) and honestly there probably will never be a true "canon" ship since that sort of defeats the purpose of the game and what Omo-cat has said about everything. As a multishipper, I love it all haha.
I will disagree with you a little. I very much do think Sunny did actually have a crush on Aubrey. In the lost library theres the scene where it says Sunny while sleeping fell on Aubrey but he woke up but didnt move while Blushing. I think thst kinda proves the crush was real.. . However i think all it was, was a childhood crush. Theres literally 0 indication that there was ever any interest from Aubrey that she liked Sunny and theres no indication either like each other now. Theres the swings scene but lets be honest, its nothing more than her being like hey take care of yourself. Friends are allowed to say shit like that without it being romantic. . . Also in memory lane theres a memory of Basil party and the main thing Sunny remembers there is Basils smile. So again i do think a crush was there it just got lost. (Plus i headcanon Imbrey so i think shes a woman kisser too)
But happier with Snuuy
I don't think you'll ever get Omo-cat "confirming" that one ship is canon as u/alt-three-rcanberra has said. Omo-cat tends to avoid all sort of shipping discourse and leave it more "open ended" and up to viewer interpretation of what you like best. For example, she's also made some cute Aubrey and Sunny art and Sunny and Kel art before. Plus she knows that all three ships have some major fan bases and she tends to like feeding them all with cute art, which I am all the here for.
Ok i guess thats a pretty accurate iterpretation. I do think she prefers a shi, but i do agree she tends to feed all of them, tho as of late it feels a bit one sided
Like I said, we'll never know what Omo-cat thinks and assuming we know without her outright saying is a dangerous game (it is fun to theorize tho). Ppl arguing that one ship is more "canon" than another in a story which isn't about ships leads to a lot of toxicity that isn't cool and frankly, I've seen it ruin other fanbases.. . End of the day, they're all kids and the idea of any one ship being  "the only canon" probably won't be happening considering their ages and Sunny's experiences. Ships are fun to play with but if you start arguing that yours is "better" or "more canon" than someone else's, it's going to lead to a lot of hurt feelings and toxicity (trust me on this).. . The best thing to do is enjoy your ships and the art that Omo-cat gives us. There's plenty of food for everyone 
Eh i only kinda agree. I know it can so easily sour a fanbase, looking at you Voltron, i shipped Klance but the Klance shippers got pretty toxic. But i do disagree with it not being good discussion. I think it can lead to toxicity but i think relationships are a big part of the game and discussion where we discuss how close they are i think is totally fine. And tbf i think everyones pretty respectful in the discussions on it
Sunny
Sorry but like real world Aubrey, I kind of thought she was a jerk. >!And I didn’t want to forgive her for shoving basil in the freaking water when he could freaking drown. And then where sunny could freaking drown cuz sunny can’t swim!<
FRICKING HOW DO I SPOIL IT AGAIN edit: nvm figured it out lol I am not on here enough to remember that
Sunny boutta get the social credit points he deserves
It's mostly about trauma and sunny doesn't seem to have depression
He is literally suicidal
Yeah i know he suicides in 2 of the game endings it's kinda obvious :l
And you don't think that that might correlate to depression?
He suicides numerous times
Only in thought, but still
Maybe a matter of opinion but being holed up in your house for three years and having vivid fantasies of one of your friends getting killed over and over again because you can't deal with the grief and guilt over a loved one's death sounds like depression to me.
Yea he isn't mentaly ok but it seems more like some kind of ptsd to me. . Mostly because he doesn't realy have sintoms for depression and the sintoms he has are something normal to him like not talking or showing emotions
PTSD and depression are highly comorbid. Dealing with one mental illness doesn't preclude having others. And it goes much farther than just not being emotive or talkative. He externalizes his depression as a monster that he hallucinates running into every so often. The final fight >! is about Omori telling Sunny all the reasons why he's a worthless person who doesn't deserve to exist while Mari has to be dead !<. . And beside Sunny, other characters deal with what, to me, are pretty obvious signs of depression. Basil completely loses the joy he had in his favorite activities and cuts off everyone from his life. Aubrey becomes cold and violent because she didn't feel that any of her friends, the people she expected to be there for each other after the death of a shared friend, cared enough to support her. So because she can't deal with the emotions on her own, she puts up a front of being tough and confident.. . Depression manifests different in each person even if we can say they all have MDD as opposed to a different kind of depression. And again, to me, the Omori characters mostly seem to dealing with some of depression or another because of a traumatic event.
I know ptsd and depression are related and someone told me that before. . And i see that other characters might have depression but for me the game is more about how the charactets handle trauma and loss in diferent ways and thats the part i like more about the game. . Good coment i sorry for expresing myself like shit
I think you're kinda making a distinction without a difference (depression is a way of handling trauma and loss), but that's fine, it's not a big deal.
you do realize ptsd often causes depression right
Yeah:). . But i dont tink thats the point of the game
its *a* point of the game. i dont think Omori can be simplified to a single theme or point, its much more complex than that.
I know but from my perspective the game is more cented about trauma and not so much about depression or thats how i see the game . . Despression is a point in omori but i think trauma is a more recurrent theme in the game
the thing is trauma and depression are often inextricably linked, both in Omori and real life, and therefore play an equal part in the story. i do see your point, i just think this is something worth considering.
trauma can lead to depression
Spoilers for game!! . . . . . . Sunny is definitely depressed. There's kind of a series of things that tie into this but from what I (I'm not a psychologist so you can't count on me for this one lol) understand, he has depression, ptsd, and some form of amnesia. I can't remember the form but there's a type that makes you forget important events, and it's quite clear in the game that sunny cannot remember the event, and instead lingers around. Although that could also just be ptsd, I have ptsd and through my experiences I can attest to the fact that I forget a lot of random and even important memories, and it kind of hurts because I really wish I was able to recall them as some of them were positive too. The human brain is a funky thing. As for depression, it's very clear he is depressed, he's rotting away in his room, and uses sleeping as a means of escaping, which is a thing people with depression do frequently, as they can't handle the pain they live in. Sunny is also antisocial and shows little to no interest in everything and everyone around him, another big pointer. I could go on but I would just be rambling more lol.
Yeah i regret for saying that
Wait, how? The closest I can think of is that she’s implied to be a perfectionist and pushed Sunny’s violin practice a bit too hard, but calling her shitty for that is a huge stretch
She's not perfect and all, she's still a good person but I've seen people here word things about her as if she literally abused Sunny
(Spoiler time). . >! About Omori himself: people say he’s absolutely evil. !<. . >! I don’t think he enjoys what he did to Basil or Sunny, he’s just doing what he’s made for but rather spend time playing with his purple friends. A wandering stranger in Blackspace calls Omori evil, but also comments the he may be the lesser evil between Omori and Sunny, and I know my boi isn’t evil !<
I personally see Omori as the Shadow in Sunny's psychology. To simplify, it's the part of us we repress or deny. . . Sunny refused to be social for years; Omori travels with his friends in Headspace. Sunny stays in one place all the time; Omori is exploring Headspace. >! Sunny doesn't look for Basil, but isn't hostile to him until he feels threatened. Omori seeks out Basil and actively torments him in Black Space. Sunny just lives each day, trying not to feel. Omori feels the emotions and ultimately seeks death. Sunny believes Mari commit suicide. Omori knows the truth and actively represses the memory from Sunny !<. . Not all of Omori is bad, even though there's a lot of negativity. I feel like some things that hammer home the Shadow theory are the endings. >! We can either cobfront our shadow or keep trying to repress it. If you keep repressing it, it will eventually overtake you and act out. We see that in the bad ending where Sunny gives up, Omori embraces him, and takes control to leap off the hospital. If you confront it properly, you can take in the positive traits and release some of the negatives. It's accepting and forgiving yourself, which is what Sunny does when he embraces Omori in the good ending. !<
Just to add to your theory 
Can anyone tell me where this video comes from? Is it in the game?
Yes. It's a cutscene that plays in (I think) 2 days left.
happy cake day
“his purple friends” is funnier than it should be to me oh my god
Spoilers for Omori and kinda spoilers for silent hill. . . >!I see where you’re coming from, but I view Omori similarly to pyramid head. From a conceptual standpoint, they are the manifestation of guilt and self hatred and are therefor inherently evil. Omori is simply there to ruin Sunny and pyramid head is there to ruin James.!<. . . Please tell me how to mark stuff as spoilers lol. . Edit: Thanks, I figured it out!
Do > ! And ! < between text without the spaces. . >!like this!!<
to do spoiler tags you do > !text! < but remove the spaces between the little arrows and the exclamation marks
I like this interpretation but I think given that Omori has existed for years just playing out Headspace and only fights back when Sunny gets closer to the Truth, I don't think he's necessarily supposed to be a form of punishment at least initially.. . . He warps into that at the end as well manifestation of his guilt to force Sunny to give up and let go of the pain he's feeling...in the worst way possible. After he's defeated he accepts defeat rather than killing himself because he'd lost his purpose.. . He's still there I think after the game ends, but no longer blocking Sunny's ability to heal.
That’s a good point, you’ve got me convinced
(Spoilers for True ending). I think another detail that a lot of people forgot was the fact that >! Omori was created by Sunny's subconscious to protect himself from the truth about Mari's death. So in the true ending when Sunny fights Omori, Omori isn't trying to hurt Sunny specifically, but to be the final barrier between him and the truth. I don't see this as an act of being evil either because Omori was just doing what he was created to do. !<
For Omori, I see him as something like an AI, so his actions aren't necessarily malicious but more of a logical extreme.
that everything and everyone is either good or bad and not complex. some people seem to think that sunny is purely awful and it doesn't make sense as to why they think that
that sunny is a self insert because you have the option to change his name. . like no the game makes it very clear that he is his own person
Honestly I think it was a bad decision to let you change Sunny's name in the first place. I'm not sure why that was ever implemented.
Fr. My friend and I played the game together (passing the controls back and forth) and, not knowing how heavy the game was going to get cause we went in relatively blind, we named him something really stupid. Totally ruined a lot of the emotional moments
what did you name the sleeping boy?..
Joemama
Understandable. Have a nice day.
I named him d-bag
We named him after a weird guy we went to high school with since they looked similar. Reallly regretted that decision
i just named mine deez
how so? I've seen none of it. Kris being their own person has been incredibly obvious, and well known in the community for ages. Even then, they'd be RIGHT in the case of sunny. Sunny is canonically a male that goes by He/Him called Sunny. People can name their character whatever they want on their playthrought, that canon is unchanged. I've never seen, in the history of me knowing what Omori is, anyone say otherwise.
I don't think you get my point. I'm arguing against the common attitude of, e.g., people saying "Kris being their own person means that nothing about them is up to player interpretation".
but to a degree that's right. Canon is canon, you cant choose what or who kris is in canon
You can't choose *certain aspects* of Kris. Other stuff about them is left unstated and therefore has no canon answer yet.
but that doesnt mean people choose those. its up to interpretation in the sense we can theorise, yes. but not in the sense we have the choice at all
What, exactly, is the distinction you are drawing between "can be chosen" and "up to interpretation"?
And why is it a bad thing for the player to identify with Sunny?
It has good and bad aspects, it makes the character's story hit a bit harder, which is probably a good idea here, and with Sunny being a silent protagonist, it's even easier for a player to project themselves on Sunny. Again, that's not bad, I would say there's an expectation that's being subverted there, but it's subverted well to a great effect.
I don't think any expectations are being subverted. The game never presents either Sunny or Omori as blank slates.
Omori isn't a JRPG though. I'd say it doesn't even really resemble one.... . Though, that doesn't really matter. Tradition or standard is never an excuse for anything, and personally I think it's pretty cut and dry that letting the player name Sunny is a bad decision for the narrative.. . There's nothing wrong with identifying with Sunny, but it's pretty clear that the point of the game is to deliver its narrative and be done. I'd say the fact that Sunny's name is rarely actually said and the fact that for most of the game you don't even **play** as Sunny is clear evidence that OMORI wasn't developed with the player's self insertion in mind.
> I'd say it doesn't even really resemble one.... . It absolutely resembles a JRPG.. . > I think it's pretty cut and dry that letting the player name Sunny is a bad decision for the narrative.. . Why?. . > the fact that for most of the game you don't even play as Sunny . . Sunny is Omori and Omori is Sunny.. . > clear evidence that OMORI wasn't developed with the player's self insertion in mind.. . No, it's evidence for the opposite: that Sunny's name was only decided late in development. We know this because most development material - even stuff that's close to the final game - only refers to him as "Omori" or "Player".
>It absolutely resembles a JRPG.. . Ok? How so? Regardless I still don't think it's a good excuse for the decision to allow the player to change Sunny's name, but I do want to hear thoughts on this.. . >Why?. . Because Sunny isn't a self-insert. If he was, he'd be way more of a blank-slate than he is. Sunny has a personality. Sunny has fears. Sunny has hobbies. Sunny has/had a heavily implied crush on Aubrey. None of these things are traits of a blank-slate character. The only blank-slate qualities that Sunny has is being quiet and just not expressing himeself often, but there's plenty of real people like that.. . >Sunny is Omori and Omori is Sunny.. . This is just incorrect. But that's irrelevant to my point anyway; the fact that you play as a character who doesn't share the same name as the one you picked cuts away a lot of the connection you have with that character.. . >No, it's evidence for the opposite: that Sunny's name was only decided late in development. We know this because most development material - even stuff that's close to the final game - only refers to him as "Omori" or "Player".. . This could go either way really, but I think this doesn't matter all that much. The game has a very specific plot that most people aren't going to be able to completely relate to, and telling that story was the main point of the game's development. It wasn't designed with the intention of being relatable, is was designed to deliver an interesting story in a unique way.
> Ok? How so? . . Well, for starters it was made in RPG Maker, an engine designed for making JRPGs.... . > Because Sunny isn't a self-insert. If he was, he'd be way more of a blank-slate than he is. . . This is exactly what I mean when I say Deltarune gender discourse has poisoned people's brains. People think that nameable protagonist = self-insert, and that self-insert = blank slate, and that self-insert and blank slate are binary categories. Those ideas are just wrong.. . > This is just incorrect. . . [citation needed]
>This is exactly what I mean when I say Deltarune gender discourse has poisoned people's brains. People think that nameable protagonist = self-insert, and that self-insert = blank slate, and that self-insert and blank slate are binary categories. Those ideas are just wrong.. . This is missing my point. My point is that naming Sunny serves no purpose because he isn't a self-insert character and the story is so personal and serious; there's no reason to name Sunny anything else than what he is already named. It only causes confusion, partly due to the way Sunny is presented at the time that you get to name him.. . (Also, I really can only think of a few examples where you get to name the protagonist where they aren't a blank-slate, and a lot more examples where they are a blank-slate, but that's just my experience so IDK)
nah man he is literally me fr fr
i named him sunny
maybe some people want to envision themselves in the story
>!That OMORI himself is evil or villainous in some way. He's just a manifest of Sunny's subconscious shielding itself from the truth, and while he may be telling sunny to kill himself, that's just Sunny's brain talking to him, because to him literally anything is better than facing the truth, even death.!<
Sunny is “emo” is pretty high up there
You cant tell me he wouldn't listen to tøp
Yes I can because it's implied that it's set before they existed 
Hence why i said wouldnt not doesnt
Personally I’ve never seen Omori as much of a whole separate person but instead as a personification of Sunny’s guilt, and when people discuss the morality of Omori’s “character” I’m always bothered because he’s not a person, he’s Sunny in his escapism or his inner moral compass never letting go of what he did. He’s a villain in the exact same way any unhealthy coping mechanism is: inanimate and a response created by someone else.
Happy cake day brother
Not necessarily a misconception, but I don't believe Aubrey is being abused by her mother, but rather heavily neglected.. . Aubrey's house is stacked full of trash and empty bottles, showing that her mom doesn't care enough to take out the trash or clean after herself.. . Aubrey's mom doesn't seem care about Aubrey's wellbeing either, not even going to check on her when she didn't leave her room, or stop and question her when she started carrying around a bat with nails in it.. . Aubrey's mom is also completely unresponsive, staring wordlessly at the TV and showing complete disregard at the fact that a bunch of kids she doesn't know basically broke into her house and headed into her daughter's room.. . I know that neglect is a form of abuse, but you'll get completely different ideas if I say someone is 'severely abused' instead of 'severely neglected'.. . . Also, I really don't like the theory that Basil wanted to kill Sunny during their fight and commit a double suicide. There are so many holes in that theory I'm surprised it got popular.. . Not only does the lead up to the fight not align with the theory if Basil actually wanted Sunny to come in his room, but Basil's dialogue before the fight literally disproves everything. . > >!Ah... there's something all around us now.!<. . > >!Can you see it, SUNNY?!<. . > >!It's something behind you again, isn't it?!<. . > >!Ah! There it is now! Do you see it?!<. . > >!Stay away! Stay away from SUNNY!!<. . > >!I'll protect you no matter what, SUNNY.. You can count on me!!<. . Heck, if anything, >!Sunny seems to be the one who wants to commit a double suicide after finding out Basil killed himself in the neutral ending.!<
neglect is a form of abuse
That's what I said
Note to self: learn to read before making assumptions. . &#x200B;. . my bad
That OMORI is about DID. Pisses me off so much. Omori is not Sunny’s alter.
In my opinion Omori is merely a manifestation just like Something. Whilst Something is guilt and trauma, Omori is (yet again this is my opinion) Sunny's suicidal tendancies. Hell Omori is, in a way, Sunny. I mean not only is he just Sunny's brain spitting his thoughts back at him, (I'm pretty sure at least) Sunny is the one controlling him most of the time. I can't fully remember but wasn't Omori also referred to as a vessel in-game? A vessel that Sunny pilots like a fucking gundam. Thing is OMORI is made in a way where anyone can have an interpretation different from the last. If you watch any two different video essays on the game both people will have at least slightly different interpretations on certain parts of it.
I doubt she was ever intended to be abusive. There probably was supposed to be some stuff showing she was a lot more normal than Sunny allowed himself to remember, you know, a person with flaws and stuff that will occasionally treat someone incorrectly without realizing it, but they couldn't get it right without doing anything people wouldn't latch onto as proof she was full on abusive so cut it.
I mean, she was a bit of an asshole to sunny, but yeah nothing that would make her a Bitch or really evil.
yeah. she was trying so hard to be perfect that it made her so much more imperfect than she could have imagined
>!Mari being still alive while Basil and Sunny hang her. I hate that theory so much. Not only does it not make sense (the truth segment literally has her on Sunny's bed with the flavor text 'She is not breathing'), but it'd also just shatter the entire point of Sunny's main inner conflict.!<
>!It would be horrible, yes, but also ruin the whole thing. That would make it more Basil's fault, not Sunny's, even though the whole final conflict is Sunny coming to terms with the fact that he himself did something so awful, and finally forgiving himself enough to tell the truth to everyone.!<
i can kinda see where this one’s coming from? ||like sunny’s dad left him and his mom isn’t present at all, like bro you left your teenage microwaved steak eating kid alone wtf||
I gotta disagree with that.. . I do agree that Sunny's father leaving the family was wrong, but that doesn't make him abusive.. . And realistically, Sunny would have been home alone roughly every single day because his mother would have to work to provide for them both. If Sunny wasn't going to school and was fine being home alone every other day, then it's reasonable for her to assume that Sunny would be fine being home alone while she was in town. Sunny's sixteen, he's going to be an adult soon and will eventually need to move out of the house someday. If she wants him to be independent, she can't baby him.
It's actually funny that Omori showed more emotion than Sunny
That Basil is secretly an insane psycho because of the dialogue in the fight with him.. . I absolutely despise the fanon characterization of “uwu soft boy secretly killer psychopath yandere”, it feels like it was ripped from a Roblox animal roleplay game oc bio.. . He isn’t a “yAnDeRe” because he tried to cling to Sunny for emotional support, he just wanted to not be alone and have someone who shared his experience.. . He isn’t “Insane”, he had a mental break caused by his grandmother dying and Sunny moving.. . He’s not just an “uwu soft boy”, he clings to hobbies for comfort and tries to stay positive.. . But it was inevitable the fandom would bite a hole in his character, since honestly we didn’t get to see much wide characterization from him in-game due to the fact that when he does appear, he’s either an anxious mess, or distorted in a dream.. . The Omori fandom has a bad case of flanderization with all the characters, especially Aubrey and Sunny, but the Basil fanon got it so badly that his entire existence seems to just be mocking itself.. . I love Omori, I really do, but I love it for how human the characters feel, the relatable aspects, the psychological horror and how real it all felt, which is something I never really get to see in the fandom.
I think this one will always irk me, it’s about Sunny’s mom being downright neglectful. I always hear people arguing about the steak incident where Sunny had to cook his steak in the microwave. I don’t know if I wanna mention that in this argument because you can’t microwave anything without power, so it feels weird to even mention . Sunny’s mom was not there for the duration of the game, so I always hear comments about how she’s never there and Sunny has to fend for himself. There’s not any mention of his Mom being away for more than the week(?) she was gone. She was preparing to move Sunny, so she wasn’t there, like she said in her voice messages in the game. I don’t feel like it’s fair to put Sunny’s mom under fire for not making her child go out, when she lost her husband and her daughter. She still sounds cheerful in her messages, making sure he eats, does his chores, brushes his teeth, goes out to see his old friend, and lets Sunny know about how she forgot to tell the electric company that she needs a few more days before they move. It doesn’t mean I like her, i just feel like she gets lots of unnecessary hate. Thats why I can’t read fanfiction where Sunny’s parents are the most evil people alive. Just my take on it! If anyone wants to add anything than go ahead, this was just a big rant lol
I don't think she's evil, but she is neglectful to a certain degree. Her kid has been a total shut-in for four years, clearly traumatized by the death of  his sister. He's cut all contact with his friends, doesn't go to school and never speaks. If it were my kid, I'd be worried sick, trying to do anything I can to help, and I certainly wouldn't leave a troubled child like that alone even for a few days. It's no surprise in certain endings he ends his life.
Yeah I see what you mean, I’d also be pretty worried. I mean, he does jump off a building and has a mental breakdown when she’s out of town.
She's not evil, no, but... Don't leave someone in Sunny's mental state all alone like that, let alone for several days, *let alone* if you know the power's going to go out. If you really have something important to do, at least arrange for someone to keep an eye on him.
You’re right, if someone is in a suicidal state then it’s unreasonable to leave them alone. Even if his mom didn’t *know*, its still worrisome to leave a kid alone that doesn’t go out or talk to anyone.
She's not evil but she's definitely a bad parent. Half of the ending in the game is Sunny committing suicide. It wouldn't have happened if Sunny's mom was there for him. Maybe she can get him to therapy
“Sunny has autism” what?
People seem to think Omori is like an actual character and not just a representation of Sunny's trauma, depression et cetera. People try and discuss him morally when he isn't even a person, he doesn't even exist within the narrative outside of headspace and Sunny's fight with him at the end probably isn't actually supposed to be him fighting himself in his out head but rather him coming to terms with these issues.
>!Sunny is evil…!<
That OMORI is a separate entity from SUNNY when in reality he is supposed to represent SUNNY's depression. OMORI is SUNNY.. . Honorable Mentions:. . \- AUBREY/BASIL's misdeeds being very dramatised or very downplayed.. . \- The belief that HERO would harm BASIL or SUNNY post-good ending.. . \-  The belief that SUNNY/MARI's parents know the truth. I can elaborate more on this later, but the only parental figure that might know the truth is BASIL's grandmother.. . \- The belief that MARI died at the tree. . . \- "KEL did nothing wrong to AUBREY/BASIL" (Especially AUBREY). . \- "AUBREY is head over heels for SUNNY" or anything along those lines.
The misconception that Basil is a shitty friend who caused Sunny all his problems and that he’s a bad person. Throughout the game it is implied that Basil thinks highly of Sunny, this could either be due to deep friendship level stuff, or possibly due to suppressed romantic feelings towards Sunny in a time where he can’t be open with those thoughts without getting bullied or experience discrimination. It says that the time of the game is around 199X by the time Hero is 15, so that means that it’s possible the game took place in the early 2000’s, a time where homophobia was much more rampant, especially in a small town like faraway town, he may have to be to afraid to tell Sunny about his feelings or anything, so I think that one of the large motivations for Sunny’s ability to get away with the accidental death of his sister was how Basil saw Sunny, admired him, and wanted to be with him always. This does not excuse the fact that he had the idea of framing it all as a suicide just to get Sunny away from facing prison sentences or punishments, causing all of their other friends even more trauma than just outright saying that it was a accident, but he and also Sunny were both traumatized 12 year olds, and one of them was probably in love with Sunny at the time so that caused the reasoning in his mind for changing the crime scene in order to avoid the person he admires from getting imprisoned. This entire experience manifested itself as the “something” that follows Sunny. Basil cannot bring himself to openly admit that Sunny pushed Mari, even if it’s destroying him from the inside out. Both him and Sunny have been left alone with their own thoughts for 4 year’s worth of time. So much so that both Basil and Sunny aren’t able to discern what is real and what isn’t. Basil cannot believe it was Sunny who pushed Mari, it was something behind him. This is the kind of reasoning that only exists between people who are in love with someone. Literally. Or at the very least, extremely EXTREMELY close friends or family. But the fact that Basil stayed like this for 4 years instead of telling literally anyone, that it wasn’t him who scribbled out Mari’s face, and endured bullying from his friends, that’s the kind of behavior only found in people who care for others deeply. I think that when the altercation happened between him and Sunny, the reason he stabbed Sunny was because either he accidentally hurt him, like he tripped or something, or it’s possible that Basil was so disillusioned by what is Something and what is Sunny that he thought Sunny was Something. Maybe subconsciously he knew, and he couldn’t accept it. I’m not saying that Basil loving Sunny is 100% healthy, because the only ship in Omori that I think is good is everyone x therapy. Because I feel like it will probably take like at least 5 years of conventional therapy for them to feel safe together again. Except for Kel, he seems pretty happy. But I think that the ship Sunflower is valid, as long as we are able to understand the true relationship between Basil and Sunny more. He isn’t a bad friend, he is a misguided, traumatized teen who isn’t mentally well when we meet him. Imagine learning that the person you love, the person you sacrificed so much for, the person you made a imaginary monster just to lie to himself more just because he loved you too much to accept that is was your doing that pushed someone that you yourself also cared deeply for as well, I think that Basil is misunderstood by everyone. He loves his friends so badly that it’s destroying him, he deserves more of a complex analysis than just people say he’s a “backstabbing friend” or someone who’s just there to hurt Sunny more. I think that’s why he says stuff like “Do you hate me Sunny?” It’s his own thoughts for years of torment finally being expressed. 
I know that the community sees that he's really emotionally attached to Sunny, but I'm pointing out people who just go "feminine = gay"
* Omori being an alternate personality. . * Sunny forgetting the truth. . * Basil genuinely believing Sunny didn't push Mari. . * Omori being a horror game. . These four are incredibly common and I intensely dislike them.
For number 2 and 3, I don't understand why you intensely dislike them when they are not unreasonable conclusions to draw.. . 2. The thing is that Sunny(at least consciously) didn't remember the truth. The reason why Omori tried to get rid of dream Basil is that he kept trying to lead Sunny to the truth. Heck, this even leads to the headpsace friends forgetting about Dream Basil. Also, Daddy longleg's dialogue points out how Sunny has forgotten so much. . . 3. When Sunny confronts Basil at the end of the Sunny route, Basil is blaming Something for pushing Mari and marking up the photo album. While Basil is most likely in denial and is in the middle of a breakdown, it isn't farfetched for people to think Basil believes Sunny didn't do it.
> The thing is that Sunny(at least consciously) didn't remember the truth. . . There's no evidence for this.. . > While Basil is most likely in denial and is in the middle of a breakdown, it isn't farfetched for people to think Basil believes Sunny didn't do it.. . It makes much more sense for him to be in denial, because that fits the themes of the game.
Again, Daddy Longleg's dialgoue hints that Sunny has forgotten so much. Also, the branch coral says the following in its dialogue about white space.. . " A hanging black light bulb... the repression of an idea. ". . Sunny also has to to destroy the lightbulb symbolizing his repression before the player can go see the black space album.
Sunny is repressing his memories, but not in the controversial medical sense where he genuinely doesn't remember. He remembers, he just tries not to think about it. If he doesn't remember then the story collapses.
>A hanging black light bulb... the repression of an idea.. . That's the thing though: An idea, not a memory.. . The representation of his amnesia actually something completely different:. . > The idea of the White Space is based on the ability of some people to completely isolate themselves when a traumatic happens. ***They isolate their mind and travel through the White Space to relieve their memories.*** From my personal experience, not everyone it able to do it. If Basil would have had his own White Space it would've been full of disturbing imagery, and, unlike Sunny's, it wouldn't be static but really dynamic with a lot of fast changes. Therefore I don't think Basil would be able to escape his own mind like Sunny does. And that's why his problems manifest in the real world. ***After all, something exists because of Basil’s idea that it exists in the first place.*** . . White Space represents his amnesia.. . And this is actually an accurate representation of Dissociative Amnesia.. . DA isn't retroactive 'forgetting', but the failure to integrate memories to begin with during a dissociative state.. . Now this has very weird implications: The lightbulb represses an 'idea', the 'idea' being the truth.. . Destroying the lightbulb unleashes this 'idea' in full force.. . Now the problem is that White Space and the Black Lightbulb exist independently from each other.. . White Space still exists on both Neutral and Bad Endings, despite Sunny already having 'recovered' 'the truth'.. . This is a huge problem. Sunny still is amnesiatic, despite 'remembering' 'the truth'.. . The only logical conclusion is that 'the truth' and the missing memory are not the same.. . Even weirder is the process of Sunny 'remembering' 'the truth'.. . The photos are Basils POV. The captions are *supposed to be* Sunnys perspective. Yet in the game, they are white out.. . Despite Sunny supposedly 'recovering' his own memory, all the information he has seems to stem from Basil.. . &#x200B;. . If you take a close look at Daddy Longlegs dialogue you'll realize that it very heavily supports this. White Space existed long before Black Space. And it is only after stumbling upon Black Space that Sunnys most severe issues start.. . This is even further substantiated by the [first 3 B&W cutscnenes.](). . The cutscenes heavily imply that Basil talking to him about Maris death is what caused the creation of Black Space. Only after this was the Black Lightbulb created.. . Especially considering Sunny being already amnesiatic at this point raises the question of wether 'the truth' actually happened or is a confabulated Pseudomemory based on what Basil told him in this conversation.. . Things get even weirder when you dissect the photographs of the BSA in detail. While they appear accurate at first glance, they repeatedly do not match the real world and are inconsistent among each other.
Omori is a horror game. Just because it doesn’t constantly jump scare you doesn’t mean it isn’t a horror game.. . . . Omori is a horror game. There are many horror elements and many parts that are meant to disturb you. The game defines itself as “psychological horror”.. . It doesn’t have to constantly be scary to be a horror game, just like how a comedy doesn’t have to be constantly making jokes to be comedy. You can have heartfelt moments and disturbing moments in a comedy. You can have heartfelt moments and comedic moments in a horror game. But Omori has its horror elements as a large part of the game, and it is intended to be viewed as horror. It is advertised as horror. It is horror.. . Not all horror looks the same.
Omori is a game with horror elements. That's the not the same as a horror game.
Something can have a couple horror elements and not be horror, but Omori has TOO MANY to NOT be considered horror. It was quite clearly intended by the devs to be a horror game and it is advertised as a horror game. You can’t say it’s a “myth” if you are literally just disagreeing with the devs intentions.
It's a matter of overall emphasis and focus, not pure numbers. In my view, Omori's non-horror elements receive greater focus than its horror elements.
I see your point, but that is really just your opinion. You can’t say something is a myth when it’s really a matter of opinion.. . Also, sorry if I come off as rude, I’m not meaning to.
That Omori himself is pure evil. I won’t go to into my thoughts on it but I believe that he has mostly the same personality as 12 yr sunny. And my current interpretation of the final fight with him is that he doesn’t want sunny to die out right but rather to see if he is truly ready to face his friends with the truth in mind. If he is truly ready for it Omori concedes and let’s him win. If not then he “protects” Sunny in the only way to seems possible at this point as Sunny has made it clear he will never face the truth.
people thinking that >!omori was evil even though he was doing what he thought would help sunny (it didn’t help)!<
This is more related to meta stuff but what really peeves me is this somewhat popular conception from some SunBasil shippers that Omocat put the most attention on Basil and Sunny's relationship in the trailers and then had Sunny crushing on Aubrey in the game with the specific intent of "gaybaiting". Like, no?? There is in fact a reason for the trailers to put more focus on the two than it being purely romantic. Their relationship and character arcs are literally central elements in the plot and themes of the game. Sunny's crush is an offhanded thing that never even comes to fruition. There's more to media analysis and critique than what is usually offered through shipping lenses, especially in a game where romance in itself doesn't play that large of a thematic role.  . (note: this is no excuse to be homophobic in the replies)
>!that Mari was a perfect person. I know that this is likely won’t be a whole lot of sense without me explaining so let me to a lot of people in the fandom like to treat Mari like she was just the perfect girl who died in a tragic accident, and not acknowledging .  that she kind of made the accident happen. She was pushing a 12 year old boy to be this perfect instrumentalist playing one of the hardest instruments you can play at that age because she couldn’t bear the thought that her performance wasn’t gonna be perfect.!<. . >!I understand that she’s human. She has a good side. She has her bad side, but a lot of people in the fandom really don’t like it when you bring up the fact that she wasn’t perfect and that in a way she kind of made the situation  that caused the accident to happen. Yeah, she didn’t physically push herself that was on Sunny, it was sunny who killed her.!<. . >!Mari kind of made the whole situation between the two, by pushing her wants on to sunny, which, frankly, even despite her age, I think that’s just not OK behavior. by the time you’re 16 you’re already a sophomore in high school or maybe even a junior, depending on when you were born. Frankly, by that point in your life you can understand that you don’t push your emotions to other people, and you should have the basic ability to read someone’s emotions about the whole thing. I don’t know about you, but by the time I was 16 I was able to recognize peoples basic emotional state, even potentially causes of that emotional state if I knew the person. considering they are siblings, it’s kind of dumb that she doesn’t know how to do that with sunny or she blatantly ignores it, which is worse.!<. . >!All of this is to say, that I really dislike how the fandom completely buys into the Mari was flawless angle a lot of the time. I know why the game did that, she died, and in Sunny’s mind, he killed her. Of course, he’s gonna betray her as perfect and of course people are gonna remember her as perfect. However, we know the events that led to her death, and we kind of know that her behavior had a heavy hand in that event.!<. . Edit: speech to text hates me
The coding is there. Throughout the game, especially >!at a certain point where it's no longer at Headspace and in the real world!< he expresses an extreme attachment specifically to Sunny to dubious extent as well as a feminine sort of personality. There's more that has been analyzed by smarter people than me and there are videos on the topic.
I always thought his attachment was because of his and Sunny's shared trauma from the accident 😅. . Either way, I don't really see sexuality as a main theme of the game, so until something is confirmed, I'm not going to put thought into the sexuality of each character.. . You are free to headcanon whatever you want though 
“Emo Sunny”
People think omori and sunny are the exact same person omori is more of a psychopath then sunny
Sunny me boy
That's a wild guess but Sunny?
Snaley!!
Oh 🗿
Sunny
tbh that was a freebie lol
Sunny or Omori
think with more flowers
🇧🇷
That tree who >!let me eat Sunny and gain some heart?!<. The worst is i've already played the game twice lmao
Wrong . . The correct answer was: >!Abbi, the wise, one of the three imaginary friends Sunny had!<
Aah i see, well done lol
It was Sunny
How could i not guess my husbando correctly 😔
Yes, it is sunny
Sunny when he got violin
INCORRECT. Hint: Headspace
Actually no Otherworld
Yes but that was too easy so imma do another. . Sunny but bad
Omor
No
🤔. . >!Sunny's head before Omori eats it!<
No. :). Hint: O o
Yay, but i see more Omori as a representation that Sunny has of himself, so i don't think they are :)
Well I mean, Omori controls you half of the time so he is a PART of sunny. Maybe him entirely bit still
Oh yeah, now that i think about it 🤔 you have a point. he's kinda part of him since..wait, >!Sunny controls him and everything in Headspace since he's lucid dreaming. Maybe what you're saying would be more accurate in the Hikkikomori route? Since in the end he now sees himself as Omori, a heartless being killing whatever is in his way when he's looking himself at the mirror.!<. . >!I personally think Omori is more of a self-insert with extra changes who let Sunny forget about what he has done while slowly trying to take control of him.!<. . Welp, that's my opinion, feel free to share with me what yours is. :)
Forgive me I haven’t played or watched a video about this game in a few years.
No, no! You don't have to apologize ! It's all alright :)
Sunny
No.
..the whole cast
That was supposed to be either Omori or Sunny but I guess that works
Oh yeah, it was kinda obvious tbh lmao
I personnally don't really ship him with Sunny lmao, flower boy also needs therapy and i don't think a love relationship between these two would be quite considered healthy becuse of that 🤷. . I don't judge and i respect that ship, so on the contrary, i would be glad to hear people's opinion about that ship and why they ship them :)
I would say Sunny but all of them is also an option
Yes
Tbh i dont see anyone but Sunny i'm sorry
Hint: they’re in foe facts.
Oh wormhole??
Nope, the answer was Bun Bunny, but I also would have accepted Sprout Bunny
Oh okay, gg
Sunny
You’re too good at that
Untrue, that's actually the first time i have two good answers in a row lol
Right again
Let’s see if you can get a third one, too much serotonin
Well…he IS a 16 year old. He may be depressed, but his hormones are still going at it.
If you collect the CD's in Faraway Town, one of the artists is "The Slime Girls," so I imagine that's where this comes from.
The slime girls refers to Pedro Silva who is one of the sound designers who worked on the soundtrack, and yes the slime girls are a direct reference to them.
What makes it interesting is that they're in a place that's very close to black space, meaning sunny might very well be repressing those desires, but he still sets them on his journey, meaning he still wants to experience them, so he's essentially conflicted on whether or not he should want them
. . Didn't realize how much Sunny was based
Asking the real thought-provoking questions here, huh? 
what did sunny mean by this . 🤔
Based Sunny
I don't think it's exactly a "fear" if you get what I mean😑 also he's 16 so hormones
i never understood the people who said they related to OMORI Characters until now
It’s simply he had his priories straight He knows what he wants  
Crazy idea: alternative hikikomori route ending where omori ditches the others and starts living with the slime girls
Perhaps his omori boy side kicked in one day for just one dream….. you never know, it’s like jekyll and hyde
Just replace omori as jekyll though, since sunny was already it minus the potion 💔💔
Because that's how a lot of women antagonist act in children cartoon.
Can't blame him for that one bruv
That’s what happens when you get depressed you start fantasizing this stuff, Boy what I would do to be replaced in Omori Shoes (Even though none of them wear shoes)
Well a 17 years old boy does have some dreams about girls sometimes
Well hes 16, hormones are still there
>!His hormones be like: “I don’t care if you killed your sister, make the squid sexy.”!<
Bro is NOT Fujimoto 😭
he jus like me fr
Sunny just like me frfr
me in a reaching competition and my opponent is a omori fan:
Don't get me started
Ah yes, Sunny. My favorite female Omori character
...what?
The title asked for your favorite female character, and you said Sunny was in second
Snuuy
You know the fem. Sunny that was scrapped that's my favorite
based.
not sure if it's proof but the >!choice of VHS lets you see the creation of omori being sunny's reflection in the piano as he sits there post incident. I think as well the style omori takes reflects it with a black top and white shorts with black lines to represent the piano keys but that could be co-incidence.!<
It can't be a coincidence, because we only see this word on grand pianos and nowhere else
I swear Deltarune can alter your perseption on protagonists you play as. Permanently. They are all "vessels" now. . . . When I used "attack" on Aubery and Sunny slashed at her with a knife instead of just punching I legit felt as if Sunny is acting out against my intented instruction. Like, I know I am not diegetic in Omori, obviously... but I am compelled to treat it like this anyway. It's just weirdly fun.
The guy Sunny be fighting at the end:. . 
wait is that where his name comes from?? I never even thought about that lol
Sunny vs Casio if Sunny's family could only afford a digital keyboard
I read that as CaseOh. So here's CaseOh's live reaction to being sent to Whitespace.. . 
Welcome to white space. You've been living here as long as you can remember.
Nah Sunny just actually hates corporate brands
he's so based
S A Y  W H A T  N O W. . SUNNY OMORI REAL SUNNY OMORI REAL
Oh my God I’m dumb. I thought sunny scratched that into the piano.
So Sunny the entire time was beefing with a piano
Oh I was thinking more of the mirror in Sunny's bathroom
Oh, like stuff like the HellMari jump scare on the Sunny route?
Hehe yeah, the stuff that shows up in black space too. That was intense
I'm pretty sure that this jump scare is supposed to reference Black Space with the infamous Friends.
Why does sunny look like that :skull emoji:
I'm sorry but the way you put that was hilarious 😭😭 can imagine his father standing at the door w his bags n right before he leaves he just looks over his shoulder and says his last words: sunny u aint shit
With a cigar in his mouth lol
“Son, you aren’t winning”
I'm not sure if we can take >!Sunny's father rejecting him!< as proof of that. I said this previously in a different post, but that could just be Sunny >!projecting his guilt and believing that his father left because of him!<. We never get actual answers about why he left.
I mean the fact that >!He's chopping down *that* tree, and the actual tree is a stump in the real world, and the fact that he gives specific line of dialogue saying Sunny isn't his son, I would be inclined to say that scene did happen.!<
Happy cake day!
Oh ty
When did this happen?
>!Blackspace key hole!<
None of this would have happened if they had just gotten Sunny a Playstation instead
Sunny gaming 
Got the LED cat ear headphones
Mari loved Sunny more than she even loved Hero, but she held him to the same standards she held herself to and sometimes it wasn't great for Sunny.. . I think that as much as she tried, she didn't entirely get him
>!(Until sunny literally fucking killed her)!<
>!But it was an accident that completly destroyed him!<
>Side note,my head cannon is that he took after his Father in this regard.. . >!Something that I don't often seen mention is the idea that Sunny's father has the same flaw Sunny has: Running way from his problems. !<
It's a good thing that they stopped at MOTHER 2. >!I'm not sure Sunny could handle the ending of MOTHER 3.!<
Sunny used to be scared of the dark and used to crawl into Mari’s bed regularly . . When Sunny was 7, Mari bought a small, glow-in-the-dark cat for Sunny to help him sleep. . It worked but Sunny would still sleep with Mari because her bed was more comfortable
>! Sunny pushed her !<
Complete opposite of me and my younger brother Sunny and Mari would be kind caring siblings that never fought ( Apart from that ine time.... ) Mari cried for Sunny more than anything in the world and Sunny would look up to her they basically we're the most perfect siblings in the world ( apart from the bread twins obviously )
Mari’s a bit of a trickster as all older sisters are. But she’s not like… an asshole to Sunny like some people seem to think. Just a bit cheeky.. . There’s only one moment everyone knows of where she was actually a bit mean to Sunny but it’s not because she was trying to be.. . Sunny’s also a very reserved quiet person as most know, but he’s a lot more open and lively with Mari
That explains how could Sunny beat His fears of spiders
She made Sunny think that lemons were "oragnes" as a joke, and he actually believed it and still does to this day
I think Mari and Sunny’s relationship was good, but not perfect. Since Mari was most likely a perfectionist Sunny would’ve had to adapt to that sort of behavior.. It also seems that at least during her training for the recital Mari started somewhat ignoring Sunny due to her excessively training and that is why Sunny picked up the Violin in the first place.. . So good, very brother and sister-ly, but not perfect
>!Mari wanted Sunny to really practice for the recital because she wanted him to believe in himself, that he could do better just as long as he tried. In Headspace, Mari was always talking about broadening Omori's perspectives and wanting him to experience new things ("expand your mind, Omori!"). She only became tough with Sunny near the end, when he had since started spacing out during practice. It's why the duet song mostly has Sunny's violin in center stage, while the piano merely supports.!<. . >!Like another user said, the reason for Omori's name is because Sunny felt Mari had come to love the piano more than him in the final months leading up to her death.!<. . Out of everybody, Sunny is Mari's #1 person. He's her best friend, her (reluctant) partner in crime when it comes to pranks. She'd do anything and everything for him, but she could have a bit of a control problem with micromanagement. Even still, she's not *that* overbearing. She just wants to protect him and help him grow as a person.. . Mari clogs the shower drain with pieces of her hair, and Sunny often cleans it up so their parents don't find out. Mari in return often does the dishes because she knows Sunny hates doing them.. . Mari encouraged Sunny to draw, and the two would spend weekend nights playing games together if they weren't with their friends. Mari would watch Sunny play video games and help him out with puzzles, and teach him to play board games (chess, etc.). She'd also read bedtime stories.. . Also she totally knew Sunny had a crush on Aubrey.
>>!had she been seeing Sunny killing her!<. . i mean... she did see it
>!But it was an accident and she died in an instant. Also I meant her ghost seeing it all happening after that, they might allow people to rehearse certain parts of their live.!<
I sometimes entertain the thought that mari was actually very toxic and abusive towards sunny, but she was just putting on a mask whenever she was seeing the gang and sunny was coerced into going along with it
Sunny and Mari love each other dearly. They spend a lot of time together and play with their friends but, it’s not a perfect relationship because nobody’s perfect.They sometimes would have fights about how Sunny needs to think about other people around him like with the violin. When Mari plays the piano with Sunny, she would often get on Sunny about minor mistakes since she’s a perfectionist. It said on the night of the last day that Mari pushed Sunny too hard. I think that’s one of the reasons Sunny hated the violin.
>!completely loving and fair while sunny had his problems mari was perfect loving and caring no matter what and for her to die it was the worst thing sunny could ever do!<
I think Sunny has/had a bit of a crush on her.
did you play the game? that is his sister
yeah
yes the fuck it does
They were siblings and did what siblings do. Fought, were petty, but were also incredibly protective of each other and loved one another. The piano to me was a source of comfort to Sunny until what happened. Hearing it all the time, I think he liked hearing his sister play. To me their relationship was (until... yknow) was very normal and very loving.. . The fact that they shared friends speaks volumes to this imo. I've known people who hate their siblings hanging out with their friends. I'm very blessed to have a great relationship with my own siblings and have met all of each others friends and hung out together despite having a 6 year age gap. (Obvi more when we were older and had the same maturity level). I see alot of the traits of my relationships with my sister and beother in Sunny and Mari's too. I do everything with my siblings, the fact that my sister threw a kleenex box at my head out of anger doesn't negate the relationship we have. Anyone with siblings knows that no one can piss you off like a sibling can. I like to imagine Sunny and Mari were much the same. Pulling crappy pranks, intentionally annoying one another, but also being there for one another, laughing together, and enjoying spending time together. (One of my main head cannons is that their parents are a bit absent so Mari and Sunny take care of one another. Moreso mari because she seems to be the favorite which makes her protective of sunny. She makes him sweets, keeps every crappy drawing he gives her, celebrates his victories as her own. While Sunny helps mari destress with his chill demeanor and gets her to do things like sit in a box for ages or go lay in the grass and look at the shapes the clouds are making). . >!In my head, what happened was an accident. In the sense that yeah he pushed her, but he never meant to push her down the stairs and kill her. Hence the uncontrollable guilt!<
i just like to imagine Omoriboy is what happens to sunny in the neutral endings
sunny's bra
At one point there were two females in his house, i’m pretty sure Snuuy has a clue on what a bra is
In the original model of the game, you would be able to choose the gender of sunny, so in turn, Omori would be a female as well.
In your opinion do you think the game was made any more disturbing or frightening by Omori being permanently made a boy?. . . I feel like it could be some insight into how some men handle grief and mental illness when the media (and some irl examples) show them as almost serial killers?
A girl Omori mod exists. 90 percent or so of the assets involving Omori are changed to make it work. Including sunny, and faraway. Only a few inconsistencies exist
it's really freaking good
please link 👀
your going waaaaaaaaaaaaay too deep into this
It's how I cope. . This is my SOMETHING
It's a drawing . . And I'm pretty sure sunny knows what a bra is
Battle Ready Armor!
I stopped everything I was doing just to tell you that I understand that reference!
Especially beta omori
Just so happens to be beside HIS clothes, and the only one bright red
💀
Isn't everything in the game technically a drawing?. . I know you mean it's a drawing in the context of it being in Omori's notebook, but its funny that you could apply that sentence to all omori art.
The art style looks like a drawing. . But it's not technically a drawing
In the context of the real world, it is technically all a drawing.
Sunny did ABBI's laundry before she was >!locked in the Abyss.!<
Wait we know what colour bras sunny's mom wears??
It indicates that sunny has seen a woman before, unlike you
Good bot
Good human.
Why would you delete perfection?
I wager the art itself is concept art from early dev, or perhaps even Omoriboy. Willing to bet this bra belongs to Tako/ABBI. Its really just the red tentacles reaching up just below it that make these connections for me.. . Don’t think its Female Sunny’s because if it were it’d be black like everything else Sunny wears.. . Not sure why it would be Mari’s, so Im killing that theory via Chekov’s gun.
Genderfluid omori/sunny
Hello a fellow big Man enjoyer
Greetings fellow giant male consumer
Based
Only reasonable conclusion is that Sunny imagines his alter ego as a FtM boy
Sunny is an egg
Depends on the kind of orange juice.. Don't get that cheap Tropicana kind. Don't go for SunnyD except for The Meme. Get a good blood orange or something of giod quality with no pulp and add it to taste.. . Cheap ones will taste horrible.
When you select the name for your character the defalt one is "SUNNY", you must erase it first if you want another name, it's also the name on all the merch and stuff
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
Could've watched a playtrought that cut that part out maybe? Or just forgot.
I didn't notice the sunny name during my first playthrough somehow. I named him kevin
Yk i can see him as a Kevin somehow. Good pick.
My name is Kevin and I never looked like a petit little Catholic boy
Well first thing for everything
i didn't see it either and i named him ash
Sunny&Friends needs Pokémon to fix their problems 👍
Did he call himself that?
Hi Kevin...I'm your biggest fan!
"Lets you name the real world omori" . . to me that feels like OP missed out on the fact that Sunny appears as a name and just calls sunny the "real world omori," thinking that the name is just up to you.
probably just forgot about it idk
no this means that OP's ass missed it somehow
Some people really don't understand that nameable characters can have canon names. Like just because you can name Link "Peepeepoopoo" doesn't mean his name isn't canonically Link.
Sorry silly me, Wasn't paying attention while naming SUNNY. I must have pissed a bunch of people who clicked on this post because of Aubrey off.
Acknowledgement is the pinnacle of learning.. . I forgive u on their behalf lulz. . 

Should I play one-shot? My brother said I should but I know it's supposedly sad. Does it have multiple endings/ik it's like you only get oneshot, but like if I delete my save and come back could I replay it? I know I could just Google these questions but I'd like to get a real perspective. Have a great day or night :3
Yes. Oneshot is an amazing game (i may be a little biased i have 100% completion). If you do, just remember: You only have OneShot.. . >!things are not always as they seem!<
Give this precious ~~cat~~ person pancakes
A fan of OneShot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yeah same happened to me, I was so confused when I saw the fandom referring to him Sunny.
Yes
I'm sometimes convinced that some of the fanbase straight up didn't even play the game at all
no like actually
?? Omori is a game???
are we deadass
are we assdead
I thought Omori was just a fragment of my deteriorating mind.
are we deadass
Or they just didn't pay attention while naming him. If you change the name, you'll only see the canon one that one time.
my laptop is so bad it would quintulple the playthrough to 100+ hours i dont want to do that
I knew his name going into the game and wanted to keep it since I knew there would be a lot of important moments that wouldn’t hit as hard if I replaced the actual name. I try to do that in every game that lets me create a custom name for a character.
There is atleast 3 people who only interact with OMORI through shipping (I'm inclined towards a specific ship in particular but I do not wish to start shit rn).
One. The hell is that photo. . Two. It comes from…the game itself…
Sunny's imagination, probably. . Only thing she's missing is whatever random ass thing he'd add to her or turn her into
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
Right, i understand that part but…is OP stupid?? I mean my god, the game TELLS you his name??
r/mysteriousdownvoting . . Edit: Nvm, I see why they're getting downvoted now.
I dont see sorry im dumb can you explain?
Replied that to every comment
Okay thanks!
the game names you Sunny unless you change it . . >!also you got some lore wrong, Sunny is the real one and Omori is just his avatar/alter ego on the dream world, headspace !<
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
the braincells of this person needs to be studied
I GOT OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this. IN MY MIND 
human.. i remember you're OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
because there is no "real world omori". omori is sunny's alter ego in headspace (dream world), and sunny is the real person's canonical name. also, unless you change the name (which you do have an option to), sunny is the name used for him in the real world.
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
Honestly, how were you playing the game? When you're naming the protaginist, the name that appears (and you can change) is Sunny.
. Maybe they watched a playthrough?
You have to go out of your way to erase the name to add a new one, it pops up in default. I don't buy it
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.

is that nacho varga from bcs?

This gotta be some form of ragebait right?
But i would also like to know where the name came from
I heard it was a last minute choice
Bumass karma farmer
His parents
Sunny:. . . . Omori: "DUDE! STOP SEEING HER BEING UNCLOTHED! YOU'RE 16 YEARS OLD!" 
15 no? >!Sunny locked himself up in his house when he was 12 and was there for 3 years!<
Picture unrelated?
Did you play the game....????
Thought that was Shikimori for a hot minute. . 
Happy Cake Day 🍰
Oh shit it’s been four years!
Oh same
sunny is the default name of "real world omori"
maybe you just hit backspace before you noticed it but sunny is the name it gives you and the name most people go with
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
You don't have to post the same comment multiple times my guy
Fair, I just was worried this would get buried under people saying the same thing without realizing OP does know Sunny appears at the name select thing.
yeahhh idk maybe they just forgot? idk tbh, i feel like its hard to miss but ive played the game like 8 times so maybe im biased idk 😭
Sorry, could you post this comment again? I didn't get it the first 13 times you said it.
Idk if I’m wrong but isn’t Sunny written before you even choose your name 
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
If you're going to say the same thing over and over, at least paraphrase instead of copy + pasting
It comes from the word sunny, which means a day in which the sun shines brightly with minimal clouds, and the sun in sunny reference a real world object that exists in the sky that gave light to the world, the sun itself is a giant ball of burning gases hundreds of million of kilometers from earth, not many people knew this.
My guy, are you even real
1. Asks a question with a very obvious answer. . 2. Puts a picture of Aubrey, and a very questionable picture at that. . 3. Says that the game never mentioned anything about sunny despite the fact it's LITERALLY THE NAME THE GAME GIVES YOU IF YOU DON'T WRITE IT YOURSELF
I can forgive the question as maybe not being attention while renaming but the picture has nothing to do with the question and is just very weird in general... Especially considering she's a minor
OP says "The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori" this means they KNOW Sunny appears as the default name, and yet still asked this.
you really didn't need to say this multiple times. they said they weren't paying attention when naming sunny so they didn't know that sunny is the default name
It can be easy to froget if you don't remember the game to well but it's the default name if you don't pick anything
why is she blue /j
bc she is papa smurf
. . Someone got a personalized copy of Omori without Sunny in it

It's because the game is partly inspired by hit comedy irreverent series It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. The creators of the game loved that sitcom so much to the point that they gave it the name Sunny as a homage.
stupid question and weird picture
what are you talking about? the name appears by default when you get to name him irl
A jjk fan plays omori:
They needed the poor boy to photosynthesise somehow
Engagement bait
...sunny is his canon name?? 💔
What is that picture?
The image makes me think this is bait
not related to the question but lowkey jeaulous of her looks.
‘Sunny’ is the default name already placed in the player name box. It is similar to the “Don’t Care” option featured in both EarthBound and Mother 3, which names the characters their canonical names. On top of that, Sunny is the name used for the character in official media and merchandising as well.. . As for why the name Sunny was chosen, we don’t really know. As far as I know, OMOCAT hasn’t told us the origin of Sunny’s name, and why they chose it. It could include the fact the name ‘Sunny’ doesn’t match the personality of the character himself, being a hikikomori and such, or that originally his gender was supposed to have been chosen by the player so a unisex name would’ve been needed.
Op did you miss the part where his name is literally set to Sunny as the default
It comes from that huge ball of plasma up in the sky
Is the picture related
🖼️🔥🔥
Like... It's my name? 
Ok, then explain plushie name.
the sun💥💥
Image is not related btw  . Sauce [Here](). . Edit: I wasn't paying attention while playing sorry if I pissed you off
Why would u post this image.. she is a child
Official comments/news and the starting name state it. Source the image while at it.
[
it was the last minute name chosen by omocat. . in my headcanon his name is a homophone of "sonny" that suits sunny as he is a boy close to adulthood with childish habits
Bc is the defaut name
It’s literally the default . . Bro did you forget you had to delete the original name before entering yours
When you made this post it only caught my curiosity because I thought you meant "Why did the creator name the main character Sunny?" Not "Why do we call him by his name?"
Reading the comments, I havent played Omori yet but, YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT I CAN CALL SUNNY "JOE"!?!?!?
Yes
sunny's headspace after the game events
My guess is that it's because "Omori" isn't necessarily a name. It's a shortened version of Hikikomori, both the conditon he was said to have since the beginning and just sounding cuter. If anything, Sunny might just be the real name, and Omori is the nickname everyone started to call him once he started to stay indoors. That's just my theory, though. . They might not mention why they call him Sunny, but another possibility could be it's a nickname from one of his friends [most likely Basil]. That's just another lesson thought out theory.. . Just in case, for those who dont know:. . Hikikomori — known as severe social withdrawal, is total withdrawal from society and seeking extreme degrees of social isolation and confinement. Hikikomori refers to both the phenomenon in general and the recluses themselves, described as loners or "modern-day hermits.". . Don't kill me if I got anything wrong in that first part, it's been years since I played/watched a playthrough
Bruh, you didn't play the game
the default is sunny.
I’m not going to use my own name for Sunny when referring to him. No one else would understand what I’m talking about. If that’s what you mean haha. . . The name Sunny probably comes from “Sonny Boy”, which is a way to address a younger boy you don’t know the name of. I guess they used Sunny instead, as a way to point the player towards the fact that the Sunny route is the way to reach the “Sun” as in happy ending. This is just my own speculations though.
In any RPG fandom, it's standard procedure to use the default character name (if there is one) to refer to the character in fandom spaces, even if you can name them something else.
are you braindead? asking for a friend
Idk
Default name
i have a different question relating to this topic if anyone sees it, is there any reason why the name sunny is the default name, or did the developers choose a random ass name lol.
snuuy
it’s his name. source: i’m him
She's 16. This is disgusting
Genuine predators downvoting you 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I upvoted his comment but calling literally everyone who downvotes them a predator is a little weird when most of the Reddit’s community are in fact teenagers, not adults.. . For example, I am 17. I still think it’s weird for them to post it but for all I know they may not be fully grown either, some lenience needs to be offered to people rather than assuming guilt.
What in the actual hell is this image?!
"The name wasn't mentioned once in the entire game since the game let you name the real world Omori". . Blud knows that Sunny appears as the default name and yet, despite that, still asked this question.
Maybe they played a while ago and forgot? I have an awful memory and forget things easily.
In the prologue, you’re given the option to name your player, the base name being Sunny, which is his actual name. Omori is Sunny’s alter ego in Headspace (best way I could explain it, I’m terrible at explaining) . . Also what is this “I got your attention now” ahh photo broski 
1. What is that picture. . 2. Did you even play the game
TF is that art
Omori thirst-trap cklickbait posts? . . When did the mod team become so lenient.
This image should not exist
Omg 😍
Why an image like this from Aubray? . I learned having seen your profile 0-0. (I understand better)
+ sunny’s hair doesn’t have the purple tint. i would assume it was intentional
exactly
can we talk about sunny's shirt  . imagine you are hanging out with your friends and one of them comes with a shirt of him taking his face off to reveal a creature of eyes and black
I would steal that shirt, give me da drip
i have the shirt B)
Watch your door at night at all times
i have the red hands shirt and Yuri's collection aswell
I feel poor now bc of u
If only I was rich 🥲
Oh for sure Sunny’s is far more disturbing but even w/o that it’s a strange concept
look at everyone else's lol
upcoming metal band
Maybe because she is so close to Sunny
maybe, but i thought Sunny just had feelings for Aubrey, not the other way around
Towards the end of the game Aubrey literally does the anime asking someone out but gets cut off meme towards sunny
oh ok that explains it, thx
That conservation gets continued later if you go to the swings, and the conservation only involved her saying that they should keep in touch after sunny moves away
she is blushing because of she's close to Sunny
it seems to be the main consensus that it's because she's close to certain people
Judging by her and sunnys reaction (supriced) I think they got jumped by the rest of the gang
sunny's dreaming again
Sunny always has weird dreams, although I want to believe that all that >!incident !<was just a very bad dream and everything is fine...as shown in this image.
*exactly*
oh god y, this all makes sense now
After posting that I ended up seeing something that adds to it. Sunny's palm is facing back, but natural rest would be inward. Only reasons to do that are if they were holding hands or Sunny really wants to.
it’s pretty hinted at that she has a thing for sunny especially in the headspace. maybe it’s cause she’s pushed close to him??
im pretty sure in headspace, it was actually the other way around, because it was Sunny's imaginatio. but in the real world, on the swings it is definitely hinted at
being right next to snuuy activates her tsundere side

Yeah, she likes sunny. She even tries asking him out right before the end of the game but gets cut off.
i dont think that was her asking him out more like asking him to keep in touch with her  . But i still ship
my my
The update for the Japanese translation added a secret ending that reveals Sunny was just Basil’s imaginary friend. After killing and hanging Mari, Basil pretended that something made Sunny kill Mari so he could comfort himself by making himself think he covered her death up to protect someone else, instead of just trying to cover up his own crime. . . He also just took all of his memories of himself and his sister (Mari) and pretended that Sunny was her brother because he didn’t think he deserved to be related to Mari.. . All of the scenes in the real world featuring Sunny is just Basil pretending that Sunny is there. Kel goes along with it because he doesn’t know what else to do. Aubrey is actually so hostile towards Basil after the accident because he keeps acting like his imaginary friend, Sunny, is real and just kinda ignores her and everyone else. So she feels betrayed and incredibly hurt by the fact he values a made up person more than his actual friends.. . The whole three days left thing is just counting down to the day he’s planning to kill himself. . . I would explain more but I can only make so much stuff up. There is no Basil is secretly Sunny ending. I made it up.
yh, ik there's no secret ending (except Basil and Sunny smiling at each other if you water the flowers in headspace) , i was figuring u were going to say something like this and then if i were to ask for some evidence, you would include some meme video as 'evidence.' i already guessed u were just joking.
Thats weird.. I saw it somehow at the start of the game. Maybe a glitch because I saw sunny have a animation glitch in the fight with Omori and sunny just attacks Omori with kels basketball for some reason. Maybe it's because I got a mobile port so some code has changed??
because what’s being showed to the player is very likely not accurate to how Sunny really feels, he’s an unreliable storyteller in a sense. in basically all parts of the game aside from the moments he’s afraid, he’s shown to be stone cold neutral in appearance. that’s not the case, odds are when he looks in the mirror that’s just how he sees himself, the same way that if you let Omori take over and look in the mirror you’ll see Omori in the reflection. he sees himself this way, however it’s very likely not the case, like when Basil is having his first breakdown after learning Sunny is gonna move away, you can look in the mirror in that scene, see SOMETHING behind him, and yet Sunny is still super calm and chill. even when it’s hard implying that Sunny is becoming more disturbed and afraid by the minute, which is what causes him to again just dip and leave Basil in there alone to deal with his terrors.
You misunderstood that point, I didn't say that the incident or basil is the only times sunny shows emotion, I meant in general in times of extreme emotions, so those are simply some examples of Sunny being extremely unstable emotionally. I'm aware that Sunny can display emotion beyond the ones I listed, however the ones I listed are the most obvious examples of this
i mean the guy goes absolutely ballistic from a fly buzzing so he clearly has anger issues
I mean if this is happening once or twice within the like 4 days we play as sunny it’s probably a regular occurrence for sunny, it’s also likely just how his guilt manifests like how basil has something
Next time, do this with a phone. I think it's because Sunny is not even scared of anything anymore.
"Just pretend you dont see it and it'll go away" ahh Sunny
Sunny has the freeze fear response like me, he's a real one
No hate to the artist of the game, but this genuinely would hit me harder if I saw it while playing.. . Though, there's always the argument of whether Sunny even showers during those 4 years.
We forget that he lives with his mother, who would DEFINITELY make sure that his hygiene is in check throughout those 4 years.
Possibly. She couldn't possibly help Sunny stay clean at all times, could she? I suppose that's where you can get creative. In other words, we could be playing during a time frame when Sunny has recently followed personal hygiene.. . Personally, I feel like starting off as untidy Sunny and then choosing to shower later down the line could be an interesting idea. :p
in the hikikomori route he brushes his teeth and even takes a bath i believe? so, idk
Ironic if he only had the energy to do things like that if he stays inside all day . . (Just like me frfr)
He still only brushes his teeth in the morning I believe.
>we could be playing during a time frame when Sunny has recently followed personal hygiene.. . I take it as in the time frame of the Three Days Left, EVERYTHING outside Headspace is made on auto-pilot, set by Omori himself, to keep Sunny "alive" and "well". Eat, do chores, shower, and of course sleep. *The best part of the day.*. . But when headspace was still forming, when the incident had just recently happened, Sunny was in catatonic state. Couldn't do nothing. Eat, shower, not even sleep. . . "I cannot live, i cannot die, trapped in myself, body my holding cell."
To your last point, reminds me of the pixel horror game "Shut In" which I really enjoyed
i've had crippling depression (still do but i'm improving) which made me stay at home laying in my bed for months and not take care of my hygiene at all (and worse stuff too but we're on the topic of hygiene) yet my parents i guess didn't care enough about it and just fed me lol. maybe some parents do bother pushing their teenagers to shower and brush their teeth but idk i've known more depressed people with parents like mine than your idea of sunny's mom. that's a nice thought though
I did, usually. When it got especially rough it was harder to keep up with but I never let myself get too bad. I never really left my house so I guess it didn't really matter anyway, but I kind of felt like I had to.
He still takes a bath in hikikomori
👍 Appreciate the clarification!
He takes a bath on the omori route
👍 Appreciate the clarification!
he takes a bath in the hikikomori route
Depressed individuals may still follow a routine, including hygiene. It is possible that Sunny would take care of his cleanliness, even if he was running on autopilot.. . Edit: Source: Was an irl Sunny.
OH MY GOD. . IS SUNNY OKAY?!???
He got into a fight with an ally cat and won
That cat's a pretty bad ally
no. 
No
no he's not okay that's what the game is about
It’s a cry for help, you’re actually sunny
I think the caption was "How Sunny should have looked after being in his house for 4 years" or something like that.
Omori creepypasta Sunnybrine
. . . I have always been an huge fan of the popular indie game "Omori", I loved the characters, I loved the atmosphere, I loved the story, it's all so nostalgic. It's been years since I last played that game, now it's impossible to find it. I Ssearch online and an user by the name of "Kel666.exe" told me they had a copy. Wow cool, I bought the copy at the price of half dollar. The user told me something strange..."hey.... yo.....when the pizza is there... is it really worth it to be coming....?"  I didn't know what it all meant,  but I could've sense shivers all over my body... I didn't think about it.. The copy arrived, it was in a package, I opened it and there was a not saying "If Kel is there, it's real, run away.". What??? Wudduhell was that??? Bitch lemme tell yah it's all sooo weird.. Launched the game on my XStationU5. I noitched the first anomaly.... the title was different, instead of Sunny there was Kel? Maybe it's just my memory that doesn't remember it well so whatever. Since now it was all fine but then arrived at the part in which dreamy Basil learns the truth for the first time, every character looked at the screen, they said nothing expect for................ "canon"    WOAAAA WHAAAAAAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?@?!?!? ok.. So now it's the part in which I play as sunny and instead of eating steak he ate...  h-he ate.... h e    a  t e ................BLOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!(dramatic scary violin).. Holy fuck I went at the mirror(in game) and Sunny looked different, he was all tired and sad, he dropped blood from his eyes and his eyes were black(dramatic scary violin) I COULDN'T MOVE MY CHARACTER ANYMORE BITCH WHAAAAT???? Sunny looked at me crying blood and said "he here" WHOOO??? SUNNY WHOO????? WHO HERE???? the door started knocking, creepy Sunny said "it's getting canon, it's getting real, help" the door started knocking in real life too, I looked at the the idk how it's called but the glass hole where you see people in it and.......... a tall looking figure... dressed all in orange... drinking some orange substance.... then came closer to the glass hole thing and said.... "yo" ... he had black eyes and was crying blood. I ran at the console and  asked Sunny for help, Sunny said "close" then he morphed into Kel. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. . I turn the game off... Kel kept knocking at the door all night, I couldn't sleep... always hearing "yo"... I could've hear him walk around the house... I could've hear him telling me top 10 reasons why orange joe is good. That bastard of Kel666.exe, he sold me an hacked demonic version of the game, I tried contacting them but they were nowhere to be found, they deleted all their accounts.. It was finally day and the knocking stopped, finally. I ordered a pizza for the night, what oh wtf? What's that? I found a note on the ground near the door, it showed the image of a boy falling down a building, oh no I remember that part, stupid Kel.exe, he's trying to scare me. Since im getting tired im going to rush it, so i went outside and made friends like the omori story cause it s a parallel or something, then it was night and someone knocked, it said the pizza was there, i opened it, there were stairs, kel appeared behind me, he pushed me and i died irl the end
How sunny actually looked like
**You know what you did and Sunny wont let you forget.**

i told her that SUNNY likes happy woman
Sunny likes you
He says nothing all day and then screams "PIZZA DELIVERY"
He saved all his power just for this moment
Introverts (me) preparing to say “here” for attendance:
im so glad this ratios my post, this comment is amazing
It isn't anymor :< rip in peace
He completely cuts himself off from everybody he knows, and the first thing he says to anybody in years (at least that we know of) is “PIZZA DELIVERY”
I need to lock in the way Sunny does when it comes to work
Attack the Sunny
It is pretty random. It's funny but it'd make so much more sense for Sunny to just knock. Not sure why omocat made him yell this 💀
Bro had to lock in for a sec
Would you rather hear some bothersome generic knocks upon your door, or a half-muffled ***"Pizza Delivery!!"*** through your walls? 
As much as I agree with your sentiment, Sunny was (iirc) also left at home alone for 3 days with no food but a leftover steak, and only $30 of spending money... $20 of which Kel pilfered from him for Hero's gift (the cookbook). Admittedly can't say for sure how well Sunny had been eating recently prior to the start of the game... but I guess you could say his attitude is more or less "If Kel's gonna drag me outside to hang out for the first time in years, I may as well do some quick jobs to earn some spending money... even if Kel has to wait around for me.". . And that spending money can be used for not just food, but bandages and first-aid kits to heal up between all the fights you wind up in during the real world segments of the game. So maybe Sunny sees working the jobs as a necessary evil for getting by, even if he'd rather be doing the bare minimum.. . Or you as the player could just embrace the depressed, reclusive adolescent vibe and do the bare minimum, allowing the hooligans to beat the crap out of Sunny in each fight... shrug.
Sunny doesn’t speak often. But when he does, it’s to get ***PAID***
“I have to tell you something…”. . *Proceeds to ramble on about why Gino’s is objectively better than Dominos, mentioning the deals, prices, and great customer service every other sentence.*
Or to pay
He says two lines in the entire game
What’s the other one?
It's "I have to tell you something" at the very end of the game.. .   . Pretty inconsequential compared to the emotional heights of the masterful "PIZZA DELIVERY!!" though.
wait what about when they ask him like "are you sure that you can climb?" and you can say yes or no?
I think there sunny(or omori) just nods for yes and shakes his head for no
I have something to tell you
PIZZA DELIVERY!!!
I'm bald...
What about the internalised dialogue Sunny says in the first person when you're exploring the memory of your house?
It's his thoughts. He probably didn't speak out loud 
Comforting your friend during a nervous breakdown ❌️. . . Yelling at houses while delivering pizzas ✅️
it’s giving. . 
*potatosunny shall now live within my files.* 
where did u get this
i dunno
Sunny:. . talking to your friends after 4 years of not seeing them. . talk in a stranger's house to get paid: 
That's how corvids do their business.
Ayo the pizza here
HAH
I’m glad I didn’t do pizza delivery during my first play through because it made the truth scene way more impactful
He probably speaks, just not a lot.
That's always been my hc too
I mean I figured he kinda does. He says YES and NO to various prompts.
Pretty sure he just shakes his head or nods at yes or no questions
I like to imagine he gives a very detailed and verbose answer every time and everyone has to remain silent for a few moments while he says it. Then he goes back to being totally silent.
I like that too
Honestly that’s me at work, I hardly speak in the real world not to mention when I do it’s usually soft and quiet. At work though I put on a mask and talk like a “normal person”
god forbid a boy be passionate about delivering pizza 😞🙏
He takes great pride in his work.
Prerecorded sound file in his phone
imagine not having a single line of dialogue then just PIZZA DELIVERY and revert back to silence for the rest of the game
nuh uh, he's shouting, a different sub-species of language very related to speaking (Most argue the two to be the same.)
I mean how else are they supposed to hear him, knocking?
Good bot
Thanks I've been dying for one of these..... . . . Where's my drink?
Imagine it's actually the person inside screaming it for excitement.
Is the pizza guy in the room with us right now?
Sunny is the Pizza guy here, this is from the pizza delivery mini game where Sunny delivers pizzas as a part time job
the mysterious pizza guy who watches from afar
Nah, that ain’t SUNNY saying that!. . . . It’s c00lkidd who’s saying that!
c00lkidd get out of my omori spending time 
I think he’s either yelling it in his mind or there’s a prerecorded voice thing that delivery guy gave him(not impossible tbh)  . There’s no text box indicating it’s Sunny saying it so it seems to be left ambiguous for a reason, maybe the devs felt uncomfortable making Sunny have one of the few lines he said be “PIZZA DELIVERY” so they left it ambiguous like that
>There’s no text box indicating it’s Sunny saying it so it seems to be left ambiguous for a reason. . Who else could be saying it? The person inside the house?
Maybe a pre recorded voice box that the pizza guy gave him or Sunny’s own internal thoughts, as I said  .   . I admit the pre recorded voice box is a bit of a stretch but it’s not entirely unheard of, but it definitely fits more into this being Sunny’s internal thoughts because… a single black text box without any header above it is usually just Sunny’s internal thoughts about objects and stuff(although usually he doesn’t give his own personal thoughts on it, with exceptions, like his thoughts calling stuff affiliated with sweetheart “an obnoxious person”)
Hes locked in
I just send that "PIZZA DELIVERY" line via telepathy duh
No, his name doesn't appear. It's just a UI thing
i like to think that maybe he’s just unaware of his volume after being alone for so many years. he probably never used his voice on a day to day basis, except maybe to speak to his mother occasionally, but clearly she isn’t very present in his life. . . maybe the isolation made him unable to regulate or speak at a “normal”, socially acceptable volume - whether that’s being too quiet or, in this case, too loud. i just feel like spending that much time alone - especially during his adolescence, which is a time that is crucial to development - made him forget how to talk to people. and he already had social issues even before everything that happened.. . or maybe he didn’t say it at all. or maybe it was just meant to be funny. who knows.. . but i tend to allow myself to overanalyze every single little thing about omori because it’s clear that every aspect of this game was intentional.
The lack of dialog portrait makes me think he beams it directly into their brain via telepathy like Professor X. . 
I always kinda pictured he just had one of those buttons that make a prerecorded noise.
I guess the Doujin was referring to this scene.. Cool 😎🆒
wait lol when does this happens?
It happens when you go to a pizzeria and you interact with poster showing that they need a pizza delivery and you can choose yes or no to the guy on the counter, if you say yes, o start working, and if you find the correct house accordingly to the description on a paper he gave to Sunny, this happens
oh nice
Wait how are you delivering pizzas?

sunny has not exited his house for years and the first thing he says is "pizza delivery"
bet his voice cracked too
After pizza delivery he put the fries in the bag.

Sunny's Search History
Well he needs material for his dreamworld after all
And so, the slimegirls were born
Proof that Sunny has reached that... side... of the internet
Sunny's laptop
I wonder what Sunny haves on his laptop?
No idea bout Sunny but Omoriboy showed us Boobs and Penises in his laptop
Could you live your life knowing your actions are programmed to hurt the one you love the most? Time marchs on for an inevitable fate, you will drag everyone down for their suffering because a cruel God said so. . . Sunny, what a poor bastard. Their God seems to have a grudge for him, for every other reality circles around in his suffering.. . The friend who he thought as a big brother went insane, a psychopath who kidnapped him and manipulated him to the point of regressing to his 12 year old self.. . His guardian angel, his heroine, his idol, the one who he grew by her said for all his life, had succumbed to her morbid curiosity and sick thoughts, practicing actions which no siblings would even thought of doing with each other, with Sunny being too powerless to stop.. . And another, where he wasn't being able to live with the consequences of reality, taking the easy way out, only to be confronted by death himself. A price to pay for being selfish, a price for being a coward. . . All of this... For entertainment.. . >!jesus we are being philosophical today aren't we!<
Yup... better stop because they already have enough trauma with this
: .... . : Ha! Cruel Gods? Alternative realities? Living in a game? Dude, you can be way too creative sometimes. Come on! Aubrey and Basil are waiting for us!. . Good ending: It was nothing but Sunny's imagination
Sunny is about to have a long talk for explain all that
Congratulations, Sunny! You did something you weren’t supposed to do, saw something you weren’t supposed to see, and prevented a tidy resolution to a messy problem. Needless to say, you must've killed yourself from the very beginning. But before you go, take this Certificate of Worthlessness. We’re giving it to you to ensure that no one cares about you and that we can promptly replace you without incident. There's a safe death waiting for you outside. Take care, and have a nice funeral. 
Sunny after four years of staying the house
Oh please is no that bad.. . &#x200B;. . No bad!?, Sunny you are pale like paper and thin!.. . &#x200B;. . Also you look short, even Aubrey is a bit more taller than you... that is no normal.. . &#x200B;. . And why you have a knife?, don't tell me you're self-harming?. . &#x200B;. . ... i can explain. . &#x200B;. . (No you can't, they got you quickly)
Yeah that sounds accurate
Good night Sunny
Probs after seeing rainy, Sunny's twin brother
Taking into account the stereotype in fiction where the twin is the opposite, it is more than likely that Rainy is everything that Sunny is not.
they saw the great painter and ruler of germany, adolf sunny

Sunny what the hell is that!?. . &#x200B;. . Well... is just something?. . &#x200B;. . Aaaand?. . &#x200B;. . That's it, is just a thing. . &#x200B;. . \*confuse screams\*
Then where was his plot armor when Sunny pepper spayed him? Hmm? 
Plot armor usually protects characters from death, not harm
they didn't include it but off camera he gets 100000000 dollars for being the 100th person to be pepper sprayed in the neighborhood
Who do you think healed them at this moment?
Sunny definitely respects the Bread Twins imo.. . : You are the coolest people I know, and I am glad to have met you. . Daphne: ..…We literally just bake bread kid.. . Bowen: Thank you.
Stand Master: Sunny . . Stand Name: Omori. . Description and ability: Sunny gained a stand after he accidentally kill's his sister. His sister immediately became a holy corpse (for some reason) after her death. The ability works like Death 13 capable of manipulating the user's dream though it doesn't suck nearby people inside the dream. This stand is sentient and protects the user from another stand that latched onto Sunny. This stand is Mari's stand "Something" and it works in a similar way as Cheap Trick, though instead of lowering the host's moral, it instead forgives the user from the death the user caused but this in turn also creates nightmares.
Maybe add something that Omori can effect and take advantage of others emotions to add from battle mechanics?
Oh I forgot about adding that. Yeah this is also part of his abilities
There is a non zero chance that, at the age of 12, sunny had no idea they were related. I mean, The Maverick wears a blond wig and acts completely different to them. I don’t blame young sunny for not realising
sunny is racis 👍
"I REJECT MY HUMANITY, SUNNY!" *reverts to monke*
i dont know but i think its so funny that you meet the unbread twins after you meet daphne and bowen because it just says to me that sunny thought they were so creepy that they followed him into his nightmares
That could work for the true ending route, but it doesn't really work for the Hikikomori route, in which they still appear.
what sunny has been thinking about for the 4 years
Sunny is racist towards blonde people
Explains the Pursuit AU
sunnys impression of them. he might not know much about his siblings so they arent morphed into what sunny would think of them
What is sunnys shirt
-There is scenes shown Basil and sunny holding each others hands . . . -He is the one who went crisis (and suicides in some of the endings) in the game due to Sunny move from the town. . . -He covered a murder, fucked up his psycology and mental health for Sunny's safety. . . -He's super feminine. . . -Flower crowns. . . . Yeah I think he might be a *bit* gay
They are children, bro said it’s gay to kill yourself 💀💀💀
Uber gay, like Blue Oyster bar gay
I hate all of these. . . \-I refer you to the "Girls kiss other girls, no one bats an eye" meme. Regardless in the scenes that i'm aware of, they're 12/11 year old kids. What's your point?. . \-Bro has no parents that we're aware of. He has attachment issues. . . \-Same as the above.. . \-I really hate this one. What's your point here?. . \-Same as above.
>!Having deep depression for several months isn't being Hikikomori... Sunny is, because he trapped himself inside for years.!<
Bro this comment is over a year old why u replying now
Theres no one I love more than Sunny ! I want to be like Sunny but I have too many traumas unfortunately
Dude sunny is the DEFINITION of trauma. /lh
Honestly i think that means your doing a great job! 👍
Sunny bc I can relate to him. And aubs because, just aubsome (haha get it, I made a pun)
Mine is Sunny. I know it's very basic, but I just genuinely feel so seen by his character. I think he has got to be one of the best representations of ptsd and depression, and I personally can relate to his story so much(well, not the sister part.) There's just something about the way that I isolated myself for years, too, and that I used to be completely mute because of my traumas, too, that makes me love him so much.
sunny
sunny probably, always found his character very interesting(?) at least compared to the other characters, considering most of his actual character depth revolves around headspace and omori.
Sunny, as in my flair. Too relatable
Sunny
Sunny. We’re the same person
Sunny. I have an addiction to stoic rpg characters.
Sunny Forever! 
Sunny, because reasons.
sunny he’s my little traumatised meow meow
I wouldn't be surprised if Sunny learned every language ever in theese 4 years
I am now imagining Omori saying "Requeiscat em pace" like Ezio when he defeats >!Sunny!<.
Yeah he runs through the door and does a diving punch on Sunny in the face.
SPOILER. . >! I figured since Sunny is so depersonalized at this point (hence Omori's existence), that he kinda didn't count for my previous statement but yeah that makes sense !<. . >!Edit: SPOILER!<
Ask Sunny
Sunny you gotta help me, i'm stuck
It’s be really sad if sunny just hallucinates the post it notes and messages in an effort to pretend mom still cares for him
(Spoilers for the after Humphrey). .  >!Is it ever truly confirmed that his mother knows? Like I always thought it was sunny's guilt of knowing his mom was trying to keep a stiff lip about it all with the statue and I know the couch one could be implied that way but I always saw it more as a "I can't risk losing you to an accident" sort of thing.!<
>!I heard someone speculate how that scene with his father was all in sunny's head. He never said anything during it and sunny's guilt imagined that as he did it because of him.!<. . >!My sibling questioned why the family didn't do some type of autopsy on Mari's body(probably didn't do it due to the price or they didn't want them to tamper her body probably) but the thought always hang around my mind!<
>!Because it’s omori, I don’t doubt the inside his head idea. But with black space it’s typically true , and even if it isn’t it feels to important to just chalk up to it being a manifestation of guilt. I’m one of the people who believe the parents helped cover it up. 2 kids could never do that alone.!<
I agree! I think they know.
Pun intended? (Last 8 words)
~~hey maybe spoiler tag~~
There's no evidence that it's begrudging.
I don't like how often the fanbase demonizes Sunny's mom. Just because she hasn't solved Sunny's problem doesn't mean she's a bad mother, considering the severity of the circumstances they found themselves in.
100% agree, she literally went through one of the worst things you can go through: Being a parent and losing your child, and yet the fandom never seems to extend any of the same sympathy to her that they do to Sunny.. . I mean I get that it's because he's the protagonist but still.
Out of curiosity, Do you happen to know if there’s a name for that sort of thing or how common it is? I’ve seen a couple of people claim that this is how it works where they live and I’d like to find out whether sunny only losing his lights would be realistic or not
Why do we have to make a lot of hypothesis for such a simple idea? The context behind the "why is the microwave on batteries?" should be enough to conclude that sunny is going coo coo.
Corded landline phones get power directly from the phone line, which has a +50v power line that is unrelated to the house's appliance/lighting circuits and comes directly from the phone company.. . That said, Sunny's phone is a cordless unit with built-in voicemail receiver, which would not run exclusively on phone line power and would require an adapter plugged into an outlet, thus it should not work if "the power" is out.
mine doesnt
Oh, wait, does your phone line run through a modem box? If so, then it would indeed quit working if the regular power goes out. Because, you know, the new high-tech way of doing things is always "better"..... . That's a pretty modern thing though. Most landlines in the early 2000s were proper telecom-supplied cables from the street.
“I forgot to tell the electric company that we need a few extra days before we’re ready to move, so the lights may cut out sometime tonight.” The exact quote from the voicemail. . . Might being the key word. It’s entirely possible that they never did and that Sunny is just walking around in the dark because he’s Sunny. Microwave working is proof that it didn’t cut out, and you can play Blackjack on the computer during the day, so it definitely didn’t.
"the lights may cut out" doesn't necessarily mean electricity to appliances and such will cut out as well. it's happened to me numerous times irl
I’ve never actually had that happen to me, but good to know! I thought it was weird, but I guess not.
yeah, i always thought it was just th lights
In theory, Sunny's hunger could have contributed to a more "realistic" hallucination this time... after all, it's the only time we hear his stomach growl.. . He also feels dizzy before then, and >!on the Hikikomori route after completing chores, too... Plus Kel's mom comments that he looks thin & asks if he's been eating properly.!< So it's anyone's guess how much he usually eats, and how long it had been since his last meal in this particular scene.. . I'm not saying this *is* the case, of course-- just that Sunny isn't exactly physically healthy, and it seems like a feasible possibility to me  But it could have been an oversight too, like you mentioned in another comment.
It's not that it isn't realistic that he might hallucinate the microwave, I don't know anything about the kind of things he suffers from so it could very well be realistic. The point is that it's not consistent with everything else in the story that he hallucinates, and that it isn't shown to be a hallucination. . . If it was outright shown to be a hallucination there would be no issue here, but since it's not then it creates a glaring problem in the story if it is indeed a hallucination. It would mean that there are seemingly no rules for what he can hallucinate (doesn't need to be related to headspace or his trauma and can be anything at anytime) and there is no guarantee that we will be told what is real and what isn't. This basically means that literally anything and everything could be a hallucination and we don't know how much of the story is actually real and how much is just Sunny seeing things.
Sorry, I probably should've used some better phrasing there  I couldn't really think of a better word than "realistic," but what I'd meant was basically "hallucinations *not* based upon anything Headspace-related or past trauma." Like... hallucinations without any significant implications, just distorted views of something that's occurring in the present, if that makes sense?. . >I don't know anything about the kind of things he suffers from... The point is that it's not consistent with everything else in the story that he hallucinates. . That's the reason why I brought up how he was hungry & it's the only time in the game that we hear his stomach growl. Basically a speculation of "hmm, well those were unique circumstances, so maybe they contributed to a unique hallucination?" I actually experience some mild hallucinations myself-- although usually only when either falling asleep or waking up, and usually auditory only-- but sometimes if I'm particularly exhausted, I experience mild visual hallucinations while walking around at night and such.. . >It would mean that... there is no guarantee that we will be told what is real and what isn't.. . You do bring up a solid point though. In terms of the narrative, it actually *would* make plenty of sense for Sunny to be an "unreliable narrator"-- but that could still pose a problem with conveying the story to players. But then again, I did read a post earlier today inquiring >!"why did Sunny kill Mari?" as if it was depicted as a deliberate murder!<, so... . . Personally, I think OMORI as a whole is a game that requires *some* suspension of disbelief to truly enjoy (if only for certain parts, like the Headspace segments, potentially the fact that >!Sunny can somehow see Basil's Something too!<, etc). But I can see how introducing inconsistencies could create more confusion towards an already-complex plot.
It's because Sunny is jo puny baby man and does not need cooking like you tiny puny babies do
That’s the point, it’s not microwaved, and that’s one of the reasons why sunny had to throw up
The real question we should be asking here is why did Sunny think microwaving a steak for 2.3 seconds WOULDNT tear his stomach up?
there are 2 things one there a a message made from Sunny's mom that said that the power will shut off in a while and omori never needs light and 2 omori dosnt ant to turn on the lights just to heat up some food  but he might have also halucinated  the microwaved steak so its still just \[COLD STEAK\]
“It’s me Sunny, your long lost brother Mark.”. . : “Fuck off.”
Not as much of a chad as universally loved sunny do
: my name is Sunny-day. . ^(The) ^(sunlight) ^(got) ^(harsh!)
>!Excluding what happened with Mari!< I'd say that Sunny's is pretty stable, as well. Even though their mom isn't present in game it's clear that she does love them --- otherwise wouldn't she abandon them just like their dad? I imagine that Sunny's mom obviously has struggles too but she knows that what Sunny needs is a lot of love for the most difficult part in their life and not the last family member they need leaving. It's part of the reason I imagine that she decides to move them into the city; she knows that the house is incredibly traumatizing for Sunny.. . This is just pure h/c for a fic I'm working on but I imagine Kel's family isn't the most stable. It's way more stable than Aubrey's or Basil's, but I imagine for a few reasons that there's this underlying tension that comes with Kel and Hero's parents pushing perfection and having a very clear favorite. >!Which ties back into my fic by having Kel *needing* (moreso begging) to keep his friends together and Hero being completely crushed under the weight of everything and developing some... very unhealthy coping mechanisms.!<
Does snuuy have a "real" name?
Yes it’s >!dead inside!<
sunnilius, sounds roman
ngl heros canonical scrapped voice lines make him sound like henry stickman or some crap, but kelsey is confirmed, and Im not 100% sure but sunny is sunny suzuki
Aubergine ~~wo~~man's handy dandy three-step plan, or as I like to refer to it, the >!three days Sunny went outside before he moved away!<
And Sunny's real name is Sol Helios
Nah it's not, this is the REAL snuuy account
This just leads me to believe that one of the things Hero did after >!Mari died!< was to go to a bar and sing really goofy, sad karaoke with the boys, and somehow the resulting rumors filtered through Sunny's mom to Sunny.  . . . At least, Sunny can apparently see Hero doing that.
Dame da ne?????
Nani
She got staired by snuuy, that’s all I have to say
“SUNNY… I love you.”
I stayed in that room for so long just waiting for her to say that to me again and again. Ah fuck it's still making my eyes water
Sunny accidentally forced her to get the pizza
Nah she >!lost to sunny in Fortnite and sunny said “ez”, that honestly would have killed me as well!<
Mari was a good person who tried her best to be the best elder sister/friend she could possibly be. While incredibly kind and loving, she also had a temper when things don't go her way (Kel spilling Orange Joe on the carpet and >!the recital!<). Which was fine, because even though she was portrayed as a mature person, she was still a kid.. . There isn't much to go off of, really. Sunny whitewashed her perfectionism, so we really only know Mari's exaggerated good side. There *are* some small pieces we could look at, for example how in Headspace Mari says that she loved Omori's (Sunny's) smile. But yet, >!we eventually learn near the end of the game that Sunny doesn't really like to smile, showing that Mari loved Sunny doing something he didn't really like to do. !<Or the aforementioned short temper at times.. . >!Personally, I think she pushed Sunny hard to do the recital perfectly because she wanted him to be proud of putting in work. Throughout the game, we see details of Sunny not really being motivated, or having his head in the clouds. I'm sure Mari was well aware of this aspect of her brother, and wanted to push him into being the motivated person she believed he could be.!<. . >!It's why the duet song has Sunny's violin as the centerpiece while Mari's piano supports, Mari wanted Sunny to have center stage.  The song kind of creates the mental image of Mari leading Sunny forward before he goes on and carries the rest of the way. Of course, given the context of the song, there's certainly another (tragic) meaning there.!<
Necro post but I appreciate this analysis and is kinda what I come up with to. . Good genuinely kind person but had some issues with perfectionism, a temper at times and often frustrated when things did not go the way she planned or thought they should go
: I am 3 miles away. . (Sunny's speed is really inconsistent, huh)
: i am -4 miles away. . (???)
(Sunny doesn't have your exact location and you're safe for now)
 I am in your walls.
Ha! You're trapped! Enjoy suffocating in there.
 (Rips through with the STEAK KNIFE) are you sure about that?
 He's in front of you now, you better start running.
(He has you by the neck)
: I noclipped through the floor and am in the Lobby
There isnt enough talking about her unique character. Despite being a good sister, she had bad sides that eventually lead to her fate. And I think it also affected Sunny, cause she was strict only to him, so he couldn't really tell anyone about her to his friends, no one would believe him. He just wanted to play and spend more time with her, but all he got is more and more practice. She pushed and pushed him further until he got sick of it. She uses her privelege of being a big sister, she definitely has issues about her perfectionism stuff.
I don't think her IRL self was as perfect as how Sunny envisioned her in Headspace, but I still think she was ultimately as loving, kindhearted, and all around fun to be with like how everyone in the gang recounted her as. She has her flaws (ie, her perfectionism) but she's definitely the greatest older sister Sunny could ever ask for >!which is why him losing her in the worst way possible at his own hands hurt him so much and it's not just out of guilt for what he did!<. She clearly loved her younger brother, to the point that >!even in death, she continued to help him in what little way she can.!<
She kinda reminds me of my older sister a bit, see, my older sister and i have nine years different, so she took care of me when i was young when my parents weren't available, even now she still cares a lot about me, sometimes her nagging can get irritating, but I hold affection for her nevertheless. . . One difference from Sunny's family is that I also have an older brother and none of us play any instruments, back then my house is also one storied, so yeah.
Can I say all sunny problems and suffering because her?
I think she is a Prime Soul, which is why Sunny could see her in that one scene.
All I could say about her is that she is nice and cheerful. She is that one type of sister who cares for other's feelings especially when making friends for Sunny to get along with. Its that feeling that makes us who we are, its how we make friends and make unforgettable memories. Although there may be flaws about her but its so insoireing to have her as a protagonist of the game. And btw, what I like about her is the iconic "". I also havent played the game but ill try it soon after christmass
Mari's kind of a duplicate of my own sister, Mari (lol), so it's hard for me to not love the Character, flaws and all. The side we got of her is this extroverted version of Sunny himself, both being kind, supportive and overall nice people. The only differences between them are that Mari can show her empathy much better than Sunny can (I am pretty sure Sunny's Autistic, but he may be nonverbal because of something else, ptsd, [selective] mutism, etc.) and that she's a perfectionist, so much so that she dragged sunny along with her personality trait, which, in the end, formed the game's story.. . Overall *perfect* character, but, in my opinion, a bit too underdeveloped. 8/10 for best girl.
shes definitely not as innocent as portrayed by sunny. not a bad person,, but definitely not without her flaws
At first (from spoilers) I though Mark was the type of sibling to just bring down sunny and treat his like trash then act like nothing happened in front of their other friends, and that sunny was so attached to her because he felt like he only had her. Now I think Mari was a great sister and was emotional about wanting to play in a recital and failed to see her brothers pov, overall a great person.
That’s pretty far fetched ngl. Sunnys mom clearly cared about him otherwise she wouldn’t leave morning messages for him --
All she left him was bad steak in the fridge, totally not neglected
Thats just what the game shows.. it didnt have to from a game design perspective keep that in mind
If you open the fridge on following days, it says "Empty." It isn't a matter of not showing it, the fridge is actually empty.. . Remember that this is the game with so much attention to detail in the real world that you can come back to almost every house twice a day and get a unique event - sometimes even more than twice as things change throughout the day. Adding a simple line of flavor text that there's some kind of food in the fridge would not be hard to do.. . Also the mom's absence is for the sake of gameplay, yes, but *in-universe* it is still a decision that the character makes. And as a character, she can be criticized for that.
Then let’s talk about the most glaring issue. Sunny spends most of his time asleep at home. And he’s clearly been doing it A LOT since ‘that’ happened, given how developed headspace is. He’s also really thin AND pale. Clearly his mom didn’t care enough to do something about that
Ok but imagine how much less fun the game would be if we had a mother tellings us what to do + moving chores. And that would also decrease the freedom sunny has.. shes not there for game reasons and not story. Dont you think that if she wasnt there for story reason that the game would elaborate on that?
What’s your point
that her not being there isnt a form of neglection or anything like that but more just for the sake of game design and that were over analyzing this
Saying that the absence of a character deeply connected to a major plot twist is ‘for gameplay’ is just as realistic as any theory imo. Especially with how many subtle references there are in this game
What? The mother isn’t connected to the plottwist.. like at all.
>!black space, truth sequence!<
Every character has their own personality and something like this wouldn't happen simply because of game design.
She could have been written to be there still and the story would still work. Sunny would spend much of his time upstairs, Kel would knock. You'd be allowed to go with him and everything would still happen. He'll since it was the last few dahs before moving she'd let you go, she encourages you to do so over the phone.. . Hell even if she was away, the night sequences and no electricity could have been handwaved off, a lot of rpgs have the lights turned off in night sequences even if the character should turn them off for horror purposes but Omori explicitly had her not remind the electricity company to keeo the lights on and also have her staying back longer for some sale instead of with her clearly not okay son who hasn't gone out in 4 years, is pale and spends almost all their time sleeping.
Or maybe she did but it wasn't enough. If you've been through depression before then you'd know it's not that easy to break someone out of it.
And some money to buy food.
I’m not saying that she doesn’t care about him. She’s somewhat neglectful
I dont think so.. shes just busy we dont know what shes like so lets not jump to concluding things
Well she’s left him at home alone without any electricity and barley any food. But this is just my take on this
Thats just not true.. there was electricity and food but why would the game show all that its really not the point of anypart of the game
I believe his mother states that there is no electricity on the note, that’s why it’s relevant…
Well they’re moving and part of that is cutting electricity off to save costs but then again if that was the case then how was the fridge working
The fridge wasnt working
Weird considered the fact the steak was really cold.
Because it was left out without heating? It would naturally go ‘cold’
Then it would be room temperature not cold and I am pretty sure the game is not set on winter so room temperature won't be cold even if it was at night
Hence why I put cold in ‘this’. The food would still be generally considered cold. It’s also labelled as ‘cold steak’
Oh sorry for the misunderstanding then
It was? The microwave too
They weren’t actually working there are theories  that say that he was just imagining it, hence sunny feeling sick after eating the steak. He didn’t actually microwave it
What… thats a theory.. and very over the top… believe what you will but im sticking to what the game shows and not fan theories. And also microwave steak is bad for you cuz it doesnt kill bacteria.. it makes more sense to have it get you sick because its microwaved its disguisting and practically the same as eating mushy warm steak with its raw properties
Well it’s a very plausible theory kekeke
Only one way to test it MICROWAVE YOUR STEAK AND EAT IT
THEN ILL PUT THE MICROWAVE INTHE OVEN
DONT ITLL EXPLODE
We can't use those three days as evidence that Sunny's mom neglects him because it's under special circumstances (they're about to move to a new place). It might even be Sunny himself who insisted that he'll be fine alone, given that his mom left him some chores to do and we know from the other route that he's fully capable of doing them.
Too busy to feed her son, too busy to tell the electric company to wait a few days and too busy to get him clothes?
My guy its a game. If they would add all of that its boring as hell. I think we’re over analyzing all of this
You can never over analyze a game about a mentally unstable child. Ask the other 20+ games that also have a mentally unstable child
Well omori is omori and other games are other games.. you can over analyze. Especially when its about a side character that has no importance to the actual story or game whatsoever
Saying that Sunny’s mother is a side character without importance is really dumb. I would elaborate but I’m in class
In what was is it dumb lmao. . She does nothing in the entire game.. its a game. She doesnt need to be there to tell the story that the game tells. She is LITERALLY a side character. . You can agree to disagree but man pay attention in class
Considering the amount amount detail present in it especially in other routes, that's a bad argument.. Also people are allowed to analyse stuff even if it wasn't let there on purpose. It encourages discussion.
Also sunnys sleeves are shorter than maris so its probably different clothing.. also sunny is a guy so definitely different clothing cuz he doesnt wear a bra… i think
Well we can see that they’re both flat chested due to them being kids,so the shirt would still fit
True but they’re probably still different considering mari was taller and sunny didnt get taller cuz he didnt eat
We can clearly see that sunny is taller than Omori. In the hikikomori route sunny actually sees him self as Omori. He looks into the mirror (as Omori) and we can see that he is much shorter than sunny
Oh yeah true... . Still I think its a bit over the top to think her mother was that neglecting -- I mean its her son. . Tho lets just drop this because this is going nowhere
Eh not really. We know his dad left, since he's not mentioned at all, that scene in headspace where he says "you're not my son" and only Sunny's mom being there in the Truth sequence.. . It's not farfetched to believe his mom became neglectful especially if his parents knew what happened and covered it up since an autopsy of Mari's body would have shown that she has injured herself on a fall and just...the entire situation in general. It's been a pretty common theory in the Fandom since release.
Yeah sure ;)
Except he already had his vest before. I'm starting to think you guys just don't like Sunny's mom.
I don’t dislike her. Also a vest? Really?
Sunny is taller than Omori though
Then omori is an even younger version of sunny which would make sense
Yes. By 2 inches that is.
Weird, considering the fact that Sunny grew taller than Omori when you compare them on the mirrors.
2 inches is nothing my man
Oh my sunny)
But sunny hasnt gone out in 4 years.. Wouldnt his hair be alot more messy?
4: Sunny's mom, despite being irresponsible during the events of the game, was much better at taking care of him before the whole moving thing.
I forgot Sunny’s mom existed 💀
With her role in the story, I don’t blame you man 💀
im you but black
So did Sunny
5: it’s a wig
have you worn wigs and will you wear wigs
No
I've seen that one of the reasons is that that's how Sunny sees himself, rather than what the outside world sees him as
Oh, that makes sense.
Maybe Sunny’s mother made him clean up his hair before going out
Just cause someone doesn’t leave the house doesn’t mean they don’t take care of themself every now and then.
I mean it makes sense but sunny cant even look in the mirror without getting jumpscared.
But he only really gets out of bed to eat and for other basic needs
Hygiene is a basic need, and there really isn't much of a reason to assume Sunny doesn't sufficiently keep this up off screen.  Sunny's problems don't actually preclude him from having a habit of keeping clean and he does seem like the type of person who would retain a habit like that.. . Besides, we never see Sunny use the toilet for its primary purpose even though we aren't ever shown to not have control over his movements (he never dresses himself either) but we can assume that he does for what should be obvious reasons.  It's not unreasonable to think this is a standard off screen action.
I mean, i wouldn't say that brushing your hair is a hygiene thing, but i see what you're saying.
One of DW mari’s dialogue states sunny was always good at keeping his hair tidy iirc
In universe, I guess it doesn't make sense. But all the characters are very clearly designed to match their age and personality. Like honestly, switching from RW to HS portraits, it's so cool how you can even see the age difference in the design and Omocat is great ughh.. . Omori and Sunny are designed to be the silent, blank main protagonist, with the story/character speaking volumes from his reclusiveness/introversion through trauma, grieving, guilt, and escaping from reality. Omori is designed to be Sunny blocking off his emotions, mirrored in Space Ex-boyfriend/husband. . . Sunny and Mari being proper emphasize their perfectionism. Mari takes the trope of the frail healer, being unable to join in activities but also being the mom friend to take care of the group so they can rest. Her trope is twisted further to her being straight up dead, and her being supportive and asking Sunny to heal and move on. Her "incident" straight up makes her look like Sadako from The Ring. . . HS Aubrey is designed take on the genki, loud, cute and funny, and borderline tipping on the tsundere trope. RW Aubrey emphasizes the loud part through her being a punk delinquent boss, causing trouble, and churchgoers talking behind her back from her lashing out because of her friends leaving her. Hero also being one of the older ones in the friend group takes on the role of the dad(mom) friend. His activeness in healing is shown in his proper yet active hair, him being social and diligent, being a cook and a med student.. . Tbh I can't say much about Basil other than being a soft lil twink baby boy, taking the more damsel in distress role. And Kel is designed to be that rough kid who trips, scrapes his knee, laughs it off, and continues playing. Where Hero is active in recovering and relying on others to help push forward, Kel is the speedster trope and his activeness is in going forward. His simpleness being like a happy dog excited to play fetch is the reason why people misread him as a dummy when they forget that he really cares and they need to move forward, like how RW Kel always brings up Mari because he knows she'd want them to move forward like how she speaks to Sunny/Omori in headspace
Sunny is a greaseball and his hair is plastered down to his head after not showering for months
His hair would be very long but I don’t think it would be inherently messy. In the hikkikomori route sunny takes a bath which to me means he did keep some level of hygiene over the 4 years.
Just because you don't leave your house doesn't mean you stop taking care of yourself. Sunny is a rather clean kid who likes to keep tidy. His mom or Mari has probably always cut his hair for him.
Unless he takes care of his hair yeah you are right
Honest answer: It's the easiest way to draw hair without having a giant empty forehead.. . Better answer: The Omori is in all of us, everyone in the game is a figment of Sunny's imagination and for the entire game he's lying in bed slowly dying from food poisoning he got by microwaving steak
Never let bro cook again 
My favorite fan theory
Ye bro just like the >!three different manifestations of sunny's guilt towards what he did to his dead sister both guiding and mentally torturing him as he desperately tries to heal!<! Normal dream stuff! :D
That is less dream like yes but some things are random like a dream
 \- oh no, our path is blocked by comically large cheese wheel!. .  \- thank god I know a very specific person perfectly fit for such a task!. . now I really wonder if such a precedent was present in a real world for Sunny to interpret it in such manner. >!after all, pre incident Hero probably had wide connections!< and probably he just summoned a guy once to help complete a specific task. And to never be seen by Sunny ever again.
You know that didn’t actually happen right? It was all in Sunny’s head. That’s why it’s called headspace dude.
No, this is all totally real.
She liked Sunny when she was younger, the or Sunny thought of it that way, so I’d always assumed she was straight. But who knows.
Sunny had a crush on Aubrey. We dont know if it is the other way around
The games probably leaning to a yes for the other way around, judging by the swings scene in the final duet, and also the swings scene in Faraway where we see her drop her tough girl act around Sunny, too.
she also specifically is upset at sunny on day 2 at the lake, she outright says "Sunny, why now?" very likely she thought she was over him and seeing him again rekindled a ton of complicated feelings
And she lets Sunny hide behind her. Like u/mazesekai said, it's her slowly taking down her tsundere facade.
Yes!!
Bro she loves sunny (it's pretty clear that aubrey loves sunny anyway!)
When they were younger yes. Or Sunny believe that Aubrey had a crush on him
Besides Sunny, I would choose Aubrey. Losing your father and then a very close friend so suddenly isn't easy, it hurts like sht. She needs someone to confess her feelings so she can find some comfort.
I would like to think she has a kind / nice side to her that she doesn't show, because she thinks it's embarassing
If she felt loved by her friends, family and wasn't traumatised at all she would've been able to express her kind side more, she needs to forgive herself and needs some love and affection, and then she can finally begin to feel comfortable with herself...
She would beat up the therapist
If we go by joke, she would lol. If we go by logic, she's smart enough to reconsider her intrusive thought and would speak to the therapist because she knows she needs it. There's no need to escape from pain and bottle it up, it'll only make the situation go worse.
she'll still beat him up then beat little kids up
All of them bc they need group therapy
They would need 3 therapists, one for the group, one for the therapists of the therapists of the group, and onde for the therapists of the therapists of the therapists of the group.
the therapy paradox
Nope. I'm giving them all a card to group therapy, and they will all work their problems out together. I won't settle for anything less.
Bot (stole comment from u/pinkiebabiebun)
Cut it into five and give it to all of them
I THOUGHT YOU MEANT CUT THEM
DEAR GOD NO I DON’T WANNA BRING MORE TRAUMA UPON THEM
Technically speaking, they would no longer have to deal with their trauma this way as well
Can't have trauma if their ded
Think you might be onto something here
Ya know through out ALL of history and religion's, mass murder was always an option (and mostly the one that works the best)
yeah that's what sunny was thinking before deciding to jump off the roof
I think they would suffer something more than trauma idk i'm just thinking
SUNNY IS HAVING FLASHBACKS
black space 3
>!If Omori is in a place like America then Aubrey cuz she’s the least likely to be able to afford it. If not, Basil because he seems to have some of the most urgent and complex issues (Sunny fight seems to show he could be a threat to himself and others (unintentionally) in those episodes).!<. . >!His general behavior as to how he approached the truth implied something was up since before the incident, like trauma, mental illness, or both (probably both). Not to mention the trauma from the incident itself, same as Sunny. I doubt the “Somethings” have permanently faded after the good ending.!<. . >!To be clear, they all need it and Sunny still needs it urgently, not just Basil. However, this is what I’d choose if push came to shove!<
Push did indeed come to shove
The dollaridos have Mr Washington on them.
They said not counting Sunny :(
Depends on the ending, honestly. On a neutral ending, I'm gonna go with Sunny (except for the one >!where he dies!<). Good Ending means that Hero has to live through a lot of his trauma again since it's suddenly completely different, so he'd need it most. The bad ending entails that >!Sunny dies,!< and while I don't like saying this, I don't see Basil bothering to see a therapist. In his mind, he contributed to >!Sunny killing himself!<, which definitely would push him to follow suit, especially considering that he was already going to anyway if Sunny didn't stop him in the bathroom.  Assuming >!both Sunny and Basil die!<, then, I'll go for Aubrey. Not only did she have extremely bad parents, she felt abandoned by her closest friends (and possibly crush) during the possibly worst time of her life, with no one else to confide in. Hell, I seriously doubt she coped healthily one bit, she absolutely seems like the type to either turn to SH or substance abuse.. . I probably overthought this a lot but idk
Sunny and Aubrey. . Aubrey had nobody to comfort her when she went through grief, leading her to be aggresive and full of anger. Poor babygirl was left alone. . Sunny had to suffer through a large rollercoaster of emotions for 4 years, counting regret and depression. He was even there himself to see Mari's death, making the memory even more painful
I think Aburey because in her situation it will really hard to get paid therapy \. \. I think Basil's parents could have money for that \. \. With Sunny it will be harder but i guess his mom will figure out it somehow \. \. Hero and Kell seems to have cool parents and not really poor so i think they can afford that
I think we can all agree on aburey, since shes the only one of them without a parental figure. That can fuck a kid UP. Sunny has his mom, basil has poly, kel and heros have their parents. Abureys moms like dead or left or somthing and bwr dads a deadbeat. Girl needs to talk it OUT
Sunny definitely
Sunny
Sunny. As a person that struggles with dissociation it is one hell of an addiction to try and get out of
Sunny. Obviously
sunny is constantly, actively thinking about stabbing himself as a solution to his problems. don't get me wrong they all need help but sunny is like one bad hangnail away from saying goodbye to this cruel world
The question is really difficult to answer. On one hand, all of them could use some form of therapy or another for everything that has happened, but would it instill more conflict if one of them was given this therapy but not the rest? Would it be wrong for one to get special treatment if they've all been through so much? Aubrey isn't doing well financially and she was one of the ones who was hit harder, but Sunny is basically losing everything what with the events of the main game. Kel and Hero are still struggling obviously, but have fallen into more normal lives where they don't need to think all that much about what they've lost. Basil has trauma similar to Sunny's, but he'll still have his friends and Polly by the games end. It's too difficult to choose between 3 people each going through their own flavor of pain, but after what they've shown they'll do in their grief (bad ending) I feel like I'd have to give it to Sunny or Basil.
Imagine being a therapist then boss music plays when sunny enters the room
[He enters the room]()
That's a difficult question. Sunny and basil are the two most obvious ones I feel like, but Aubrey could use it as well. Or maybe if this is before "the incident", I could give it to mari, and she could find some way to work through the stress of the pressure from the performance, so she'd be more calm with sunny and maybe not have it go as far as it did
All of them but I think if only one definitely babsil because kid kills himself in more than half the endings. Nobody even knows anything about what happened to him at all except Sunny who just noped outta there for four years.  Obviously Sunny needs therapy as much as he does but he’s often neglected as a cute little guy and not a really traumatized person who handles his grief in ways that could definitely be benefitted from therapy. I just wanna see him smile again he’s such a nice person. He never deserved any of this. (Nor did sunny but I mean duh)
Plus sunny partially (even if, really struggling) healed himself, if we are talking about the good ending, his "fight" with omor leaded him to the biggest step to forgive himself, while, Basil got a bit "helped" from sunny revealing the truht, but isn't nearly as healed as him, even tough, sunny still is in a critical condition, it isnt as basil, cause (if good ending ofc) sunny has a strong mentality as we saw from his ability to overcome this situation (got the jok?!?!!! HHHHAhahahahahHShha, i am not sorry.)
Sunny is the one that probably needs it the most. But I would give it to Basil if you exclude Sunny, because he was there when everything happened.
Sunny>Basil>Aubery>Hero>Kel
I think Basil and Sunny need it the most.
Everyone to a free thayrapy  session every week
All of them
As a a person who hasn’t played the game (plans to), Omori, because Omori
group therapy hehehe
Absolutely sunny or Basil. The real hard thing is between those two
all of em
Me
Sunny moved on and excepted it in the sunny route. Basil has some trauma but all bro did was be a accomplice go the crime. So Aubrey with her home life and losing a close friend along side her father, she deserved it.
I'd splitted it in six, and then I'd bring each ⅙ to each of them so that everyone goes to therapy
none of them. . I will help them all myself
I'm stuck between Aubrey sunny and basil
Kel, Sunny and Basil
I would probably give it to Basil, I think he needs it the most (excluding Sunny).
Yeah. I'm gonna copy/paste that card and give all of them one.
Sunny, Basil or Aubrey. All went through a lot after what happened.
Besides sunny basil
I’d give it to omori, he isn’t part of the group technically speaking but seeing the ending resolved without such conflict could probably merit something for sunny and perhaps the rest of the group.
Omori
If not Sunny, Kel.. . Bestie been through FAAAR to much
Can I take it for myself?
Well I would say Sunny, but since he already kind of therapized himself quite a bit(not enough but yk) in the good ending, Basil.
if i give it to me, can i share? QQ
Either basil or sunny, while Aubry, kel, and hero could definitley use therapy basil and sunny are the only 2 that are visibly in immediate danger and could use the help more. If I had to pick one I'd say Basil, because while Sunny is deeply troubled and definitely needs help, basil's problems feel like they're much more serious and deep seeded, whereas sunny is just one *horrible* ***horrible*** psychonauts level away from being at least a bit better. And while that isn't a permanent solution, I'd say sunny is able to remedy his situation a bit better on his own
everyone
babil 🤑
I want to give them all for diffrent reasons. . Sunny/Basil: They killed someone and kept it to themself for four years . . Kel: He doesn't like to burden the group with his feelings they have all their own problems so he just puts on a smile and acts funny to try and cheer them up while his problems get worse and worse . . Aubrey: She lost two people very close to her in such a short amount of time
Double it and pass it to the next person
I have no clue and why have I been getting so much Omori content lately!?
Besides Sunny? . . It's tough, Aubrey and Basil would BOTH benefit from it. Aubrey lost her dad, her mother is an alcoholic AND one of her best friends and older sister figure >!seemingly committed suicide.!< Oh yeah, and Sunny's hikikomori status afterwards definitely didn't help.. . Meanwhile, Basil, who was practically raised by his grandma and Polly, witnessed some shit, (>!namingly his best friend accidentally pushing his big sister, who is also a very close friend down the stairs.!< That and the fact that >!it was his idea to frame it as a suicide!< along with the guilt he faces due to Sunny's 4 year long hikikomori status definitely puts him in a place to need it.
Double it and give it to the next person
Sunny.
Besides sunny it's basil, bro literally had >!to cover up a murder at 12 years old!<
I would do Ctrl + C to the card and give the cards all of them.
Since everyone already take all of omori gang to the therapist I will use the free card for therapist's therapy
They can all take turns with it
Babil
Yes
Isn’t the entire game’s plot that it’s SUNNY who deserves it the most 
I'm going to use it for myself
I mean you could argue if sunny went to therapy to begin with, the events of the game would've never happened, thus significantly reducing the others' need for it.
After or before the true ending? If after, Aubrey. If before Basil. Sunny is at least able to cope on a surface level(it isn't a healthy way of coping but still keeps him alive)
Probably sunny or aubery. But mostly sunny. Hero's a good pick too.. . But in general, all of them need therapy. 
Okay sp the obvious choice is Sunny, but I think I'd choose Basil because he's my baby
Double it and give it to the next person
are we talking about after confesssion or before confession. Thearpy for Sunny before Confession is meaningless
S U N N Y
Can't I just shred the card to thousands of pieces and issue each piece for this subreddit's members? 
I love little Basie🥹💖 he IS my favourite aside from Sunny himself
Broke: "the game was made throughout a duration of >5 years with handdrawn art so it's gonna be inconsistent". . Woke:"Sunny can't remember details right"
Bespoke: Everyone in Omori has chameleon skin
Unspoke: the camera had flash on
Shock: The sun was at different angles
"Do you see it, SUNNY? SOMETHING behind you?"
it is because it is sunnys headspace. dreams are not consistent
It’s actually because lots of this was done years apart, the whole project took over 5 years and a lot of it is hand-drawn so minor inconsistencies like these make sense.
theres quite a few inconsistencies in the rw too
if we stick to the explanation that the inconsistencies are due to an unreliable sunny pov, we could make the declaration that sunny is mixing memories with what he sees in the rw, and there is game evidence that would back this up. however as cool as this headcanon is (it is my preferred way to explain the inconsistencies), it is definitely just to do with the development time and struggles
maybe that’s because sunny’s memory is dogshit?
Or because they're composites of all the different experiences Sunny had with them, so of course they'd vary in presentation a bit?
How are you not noticing that the saturation of *all* colors between game sprites and a picture is different??. It's not inconsistency it's an artistic choice. It makes the picture feel like Sunny drew it on a sheet of paper.
Sunny is doing sleepy racism
Yea I‘m literally snuuy
Mine would be similar to Sunny’s just a little different.. I would have my computer, my sketchbook, and my cat, dexter. I would also have a radio, a camera, and a chicken plush. Instead of a black lightbulb I’d have multiple black lanterns spread across the ground, with some white lightbulbs around the ceiling. I have an old image for this somewhere I think.
Here it is:. . . . It’s not exactly how I described it because this is old but yeah that’s it.
Literally same set up as sunny but instead of a tissue box maybe like a plush dragon
My cat Pancake, an Xbox, a body pillow of *coughs*-Sunny-*coughs* no one it'll be blank, and a karaoke machine.
POV: sunny
The 15th would be "Good night, Omori". . And the 16th and final album would be "Good morning,Sunny". . And of course don't forget the bonus albums!
I was gonna say >!The Stairs!<. lol………… but Bouquet is too damn good. . Edit:  Hey… Thanks Sunny/Snuuy
Hey that's actually pretty good. I enjoy all omori jokes honestly.
P sure they meant that the dream versions of them aren't real, since sunny couldn't see that his friends have changed since the incident
it was during the final boss, when >!i felt like omori was talking to me instead of sunny!< at some points
I got this feeling too, it makes the fight so much more uncomfortable
>!On the hikikomori route, when Sunny is supposed to take a bath.!< I went to the door and when I went back to the stairs then something appeared and I scream
I haven't played through the whole game yet, but so far >!the first section where you play as Sunny was the scariest, with scenes like that later on not being so bad.!<
>! In the omori fight when sunny eyes start to be red and he's losing it!< This the moment i knew this game is masterpiece, and not just fight-talking-explore and something about storry, then it's a loop.. . Cant explain why that's scariest for me but i love this. . And also the red one (left up) and the right down . most of the jumpscares is pretty obvious but this wasn't 
Demon sunny , really wasn't expecting that
The first time you Play as sunny. I wasn't expecting the Real hand lmao
When Sunny had to go outside, i felt so bad for him, he even touched grass. Traumatizing.
I'm not exactly sure where it is in the game but >!around when Sunny places the lightbulb in the lamp and heads outside, there's a picture frame with Sunny in it and he has red eyes and stuff and that unnerved me so much... it felt like he was staring into my soul!< Maybe not the scariest moment but definitely up there for me
Hellsunny
Hikkikomori ending, the one where the only sound during the credits is Sunny's mom trying to call him. Probably the most grim moment in any game I've ever played.
Right before >!Sunny gets stabbed in the eye!<
Aside from the Truth section, it would have to be the sequence leading up to the fight with Arachnophobia Something. I absolutely can’t take bugs like spiders and scorpions. I can deal with one. I can deal with a tiny spider if it’s just sitting somewhere and I can spray it or hot it with a shoe. But seeing Sunny’s house *filled to the brim with masses of spiders where you couldn’t even see the floor*, the enormous spiders with the single eye, the legs that would rise up and swat at the staircase as you tried to walk up it, the whispering and hissing sounds in the background . . Needless to say my girlfriend forced me to take a break from playing afterwards so I wouldn’t have a panic attack

Sunny already won
Depends on the arena. If there are stairs then sunny wins
I'm not sure if you mean Omori or Sunny, either way, I don't think you thought this one through... He already won
The last battle in the sunny route. The one with the distorted screams. I know it is intended to sound unpleasant and tense there, but maybe it achieves its goal too well.

Or it's just how their parents wanted to name them? The game doesn't take place in Japan, they could've just wanted to name Mari with the spelling they preferred (whether it's because they wanted to make sure it was pronounced a certain way, they thought it looked nicer, cultural reasons, etc) and did the same for Sunny. . . Sanii also just isn't really a name used often if at all in Japan, and the little I *have* seen of it from Googling says it'd be a name for a girl if it was used, and it wouldn't have the same meaning as Sunny. It wouldn't make sense for them to use it.
Idk about other people, but for me I picked it because of alliteration with Sunny, and Mari’s name could be interpreted as Japanese with its spelling. Like maybe their parents are immigrants and Mari was born in Japan just before they moved so she has a Japanese name but sunny was born later so he has a non Japanese name, but they didn’t know what non Japanese name to pick so they chose Sunny because it’s a pretty name
Sunny sideup
Looking at some of the comments here, I would like to nerd out and say my headcanon for Sunny's actual name, Hibiki (日陽気). The kanji is scuffed, but it basically translates to sunny day.. . Anyways, my headcanon last names are:. . Hibiki "Sunny" Suzuki   . Mari Suzuki   . Kelsey García   . Henry García   . Aubergine Kelly   . Basil Burns (funny). . Pollyanna MacArthur (don't ask)  . edit: typesetting issues

Apologies for the text dump I love overly explaining my headcanons. . Omori Omori . . Mari & Sunny Suzuki. . (honestly I just picked up this from basic fanon and I like the way it sounds. Also I like to imagine Sunny's real name is actually "Ray" and it evolved into Sunny over the years bc of Mari nicknaming him her "Ray of Sunshine"). . Henry "Hero" & Kel Ramirez. . (not much actual thought behind this but I know a Ramirez that reminds me of Hero so it became my hc. Although so far it seems like Rodriguez is the fanon winner? So I might start using that). . Basil Fahrafell-Smith. . (Smith is his grandma's & dad's last name, bc I think Granny Smith is funny for the plant family. but Fahrafell is Polly's last name so in my hc when she becomes his legal guardian he takes both names). . I haven't found a last name I like for Aubrey . . Kim & Vance Nuñez. . Mikhail & Bowen & Daphne Baker (ofc they are part of the family that runs Baker's Bakery on Bakersfield Avenue). . Don't have hc last names for Angel or Charlene, or any of the other prominent townsfolk like Mincy or Cris

Omori-Sunny-Maxy?
Yeah. I personally related to Sunny a lot, as I too used maladaptive daydreaming to avoid my problems and trauma, but after playing the game it encouraged me to get therapy and face my fears head on.
Awesome! I imagine you've still got a journey ahead of you, but the fact that you started it is amazing! . . Good luck!
Discord gif of sunny doing some traumatised shit with the caption “when among us”
My friend, addicted to Omori, sent a whole group chat that I was in a meme on 7/20 abot Snuuy, which is Sunny's birthday as everyone knows. I decided to look more into the game and got VERY VERY interested because of fucking ✨babil✨ and managed to convince my parents to buy the game Omori. I completed it about 3 or 4 times, and working to see some alternative routes. Now here I am, knowing a lot of Omori but not all.
A video analyzing Sunny's mental state and trauma came up in my recomended.
I watched this girl play the beginning of the game like 2 years ago and immediately stopped watching because it looked really cool and I didn’t want any spoilers. She also tried to name sunny omori, but then the game said that his name wasn’t omori
i saw some fanarts and at first i thought it was a strange anime series about a boy(sunny) getting bullied, but next i discovered that it was an rpg game and i get interested, and i watched some gameplays, and now i know how the hair conditioning is fucking awesome
I saw a meme of Sunny and Something working at McDonalds, thought Sunny looked familiar so I looked to see what it was from, commemts said Omori so i watched a trailer and instantly got interested.
The crime is that he lied to Sunny about not having money.
that’s the worst one. get that fucking bastard. . edit: tf was my auto correct on lmfao
Oh well, I stole the 20 dollars out off his wardrobe, so I can't complain too

bepis valley granola bars
pepsi
He probably asked sunny to buy the bag since he asked sunny to buy a gift for hero
he forget his wallet but remembered the fact he had 10$ in his pocket anyway, realized it wasn’t enough to pay Sunny back, was going to repay him tomorrow, then forget to pay him which is why he just lets Sunny take the 20$ from his closet
Come on Sunny dont con a con man /ref
We did it, >!we found the something he was talking about. It really wasn't Sunny's fault!<
The last frames would be my nightmares as Sunny
Same if I have depression tho
If we're trying to be canonically accurate I'd say that Headspace Logic would not have any of the cat exist beyond what we see- maybe it extends a few extra feet before turning transparent and fading into nothing. The part of the Cat we see is truly all that exists because that's all that needs to for Sunny to feel content with his Neighbor's Room.. . Personally, though, if I were to have a view from behind the wall I'd have it be like figure A but with a slightly longer body.
What if it goes past >!Black Space!< And extends down into a deeper layer of Sunny's mind?
What could be deeper than black space? the ancient reptilian brain?
Sunny's baby memories
>!gerson dodges and sunny falls down the stairs.!<
Gerson: “Aw, crap! The kid, no!!!”
“Don’t worry Sunny, it doesn’t have to perfect”
Gerson gives Sunny free therapy without him even realizing it to make him grow as a person and return outside. . . Edit: called him Gereon woops lmao
AU where Sunny actually fucking murders his sister with a hammer instead of just manslaughter
Gerson saves Sunny before 3 days left even start, locking away the bad endings where Sunny offs himself
OMORI wouldn’t happen because ,>! Gerson wouldn’t pressure Sunny to a breaking point 🤔 !<
Sunny has been in his house for 4 years he obviously plays league
draven main
He's chill guy. Maybe he plays a stack-late game character like nasus?
Nah he mains Amumu
as a league player i can confirm he s one of us
Agreed.
Sunny play Hell Let Loose
Yeah Sunny likes hollow knight
Sunny plays omori (?
“Wtf, those are my OCs.”. . -Sunny, probably
Perhaps
I think Sunny would be a Rocket Jump God in quake arena and TF2
There are 2 kinds of people. . The kind that think Sunny is a competitive player. . And the kind that think Sunny is a RPG lover
Given the headspace mechanics sunny would like RPGs
Sunny would absolutely play silent hill 2
YESSS
remember when james threw mary down the stairs
It was the historical society stairs specifically
Sunny has definitely put his friends in tomodachi life at one point
YUPPPPP
Dunno about the others but pretty sure sunny would play Omori if he had the chance 
Sunny would definitely play MGS
The man who sold the world
When you can’t even say
he is the man who sold the world after
Sunny plays League or Isaac. That’s the real reason he never came outside.
OHH ISAAAC IS A GOOD ANSWER
Sunny would be cracked at Fortnite
I think sunny would play something like In Stars and Time, or maybe like Celete and then >!throw his sister down the stairs!< because he couldn't beat farwell
I CAN’T STOP LAUGHING AT THIS HELP😭
ITS TRUE THAT GAME IS SO HARD IF YOU 100% IT 😭😭😭
No fr, I had to rage quit so many times!! 😭. 100%ing it is still worth it tho lol
IKKK (I'm 3/4 done with farewell, and have 30/32 achievements, I am SO CLOSERE)
Dang, that is really close! I’ve beat all the levels and gotten 31/32 achievements plus a handful of goldens. If you’ve made it this far I’m sure you can finish everything! Good luck!
I genuinely believe sunny Would love omori, the only reasons that could lead to him hating the game is, his trauma and experidnces being literally in It.
I personally have the headcanon that Sunny made "Omori" (the game) in-universe and that's why he spent 4 years inside  .   . He was busy making his psychological horror game and got too addicted that he thought it was real
Omg love that
Sunny definitely plays indie games, especially RPGs. I mean, just look at Headspace. I feel like he would also have played FF7 before.
Sunny does play what appears to be game boy games in the photographs
There is zero information about it, but my headcanon is that Sunny likes slasher games like Devil May Cry 3, Ninja Gaiden 2, DOOM Eternal, Hotline Miami, Vanquish and Bayonetta.
Sunny would play morrowind, maybe oblivion as well
Sunny:. . 
Yup
Sunny will play Omori
Sunny is the typa guy to play Risk Of Rain 2
Sunny is a fan of classic RPGs
Sunny would love Omori
Sunny plays friday night funkin. I swear he does. He does.
Sunny would play ultrakill
Sunny would play omori
Sunny would definitely play delatrune
Sunny has blackjack on his computer
my brain is so rotted that I almost deadass typed "Sunny would play Omori!". . 
Sunny would play Fallout: New Vegas as a true melee build that rushes to the casino to play blackjacks as soon as the game starts.
Sunny definitely grinds dayz I can see it
Sunny is someone to be playing NavyField or Battlestations: Midway in his free time.
Do people wear thigh highs to bed? I thought the whole thing about headspace is that they all wore pajamas. . Anyway I'd love to look like OMORI. . Well probably more Sunny because he's closer to my age but still
>Do people wear thigh highs to bed?. . I wish
SUNNY PI (3.14)
The….the keys spell Sunny…
and the numbers say 143…
As someone with childhood trauma who occasionally has paranoid episodes, I genuinely am still unsure if Sunny has the kind of imagines-Something-in-every-corner-or-shadow like I have before or if he hallucinates too, like at night time. . . Whilst I am certain Basil does see unreal things, it is quite interesting if Sunny is imagining things in shadows rather then actually seeing them, as his Somethings are usually in dark rooms or from objects, the one that I can recall different is when seeing Something above the stump at the last day
Could be having a >!psychotic episode like the one that leads to his suicide/struggle with sunny later on!< Or perhaps he's just panicking because his bullies just surrounded him
Well for one they've already surrounded and bullied him both mentally and physically beforehand and applied for years. I so don't understand their reaction like shocked he'd be scared. Also I believe this was after him discovering that Sunny is leaving, so at this point he was even more vulnerable than normal.. . Plus let's be fair I think had he not break in that moment, they were gonna bully him anyway.
I sort of thought it was like... he found out Sunny is leaving yesterday, and he's so distraught and thinking that he might die without Sunny that he's basically desperately screaming for ANYONE to help him, going so far as to ask his bullies for help, l because he just can't deal with anything anymore and doesn't know what to do. But, that may be a bit of a stretch in retrospect...
Could that happen when the two people had not seen each other in four years and weren't as close?. . Like, you could make the argument that Basil and Sunny, despite not seeing each other, were too close and shared enough trauma for that to happen. . But Sunny and Hero?
Appearantly, Sunny can play the piano:. . 
What's that from? I don't think I've seen it
It occurs when you take the “Omori” tape after entering the hole left by the O key, which can be located in the ghost party area.
Iirc it's from the room with VHS tapes
I'm not saying it's a hallucination.. . Just that Sunny can the piano.
Oh yeah i agree sunny know piano at least a bit
i do not think either of those are examples of group hallucinations. the fight in question is definitely just sunny freaking the fuck out
That window literally only appears in her scenes, not to forget how she mentions it in a sentence related to Sunny almost drowning.
Maybe sunny started playing abit
I think sunny was playing the piano as he hallucinated
Sunny was probably absentmindedly hitting keys.
İ think sunny is The one who play with piano.
sunny busted out a quick one on the piano
They could both be hallucinating because for Sunny he didn't went there since a LONNNNNNG TIME AGO and for Hero it's the same he didn't went to Sunny's house since the tragedy sooo... It's highly likely that they both have the same feels and state of mind to hallucinate the piano
Wasn’t this part of the original plan, but scrapped since they’d have to re-do every animated scene with a female Sunny?
Yeah, and the only remnant of it still in the game is >!omori route!< exclusive, and only usable in one area
Wait, I'm not sure what you're referring to. What is it?
I swear every day I learn something new about this game
i really need to play the omori route, i feel like i keep hearing about new interesting things that it has all the time
I wish that sunny’s name was fixed 💀 I went in blind and just changed his name to ‘benjamn’
A moment of silence for the people who named him something like "Penids" or "AssDik." 😔✊
Whats the deal woth naming him like that? I guess you cant change back or is there something more to it?
ig its harder to take the game seriously
My brother took the controller and named him “ballguy” and I was stuck with that 😔
no wonder he was so depressed 
I HAD MINE NAMED DADDY
i didn’t rly know what was happening and named him Omorey
I named him "Ethan" when I played. No that's not my name. Not any family members name either. Or a friends name. I don't know why I did this
Funnily enough, I named him Moon
Tbh I wish Sunny's name didn't even change in the story.
Besides being curious about how the character designs would look, I don’t really see the point.
And i wish we didn’t even have the option to change sunnys name tbh
The question confused me and I named him 'the boy'
I named him, boy.
BOI. . 
Here comes the…
&#x200B;. . 
He *is* the boy though
it gives me pain when i watch OMORI playthroughs and they name him like “deez” or something
your best take yet
What? I did. I named him Honey. (Without even knowing his was sunny so funny coincidence)
but on the naming screen its defaulted to sunny?
It didnt for me :0
I named him Sunny since I already knew his name previously
I literally named him "Diamond" because I was like oh people usually name the main character after themselves right? It just made me super uncomfortable with the fact that I fought my favorite plant boy and that I >!killed my sister and had my best friend hang her!<
Customization is fun, even if it’s as simple as changing the character’s gender, IMO.
In general, yes, but this isn't Pokemon. Sunny is his own character, not a blank slate for the player to project themself on
Could pull a persona 3 portable and make female sunny drastically different to the cannon sunny. . . I.e p3mc is a depressed loner who is aphatic to death where as the femc is a depressed loner on the inside and a disaster train, gremlin on the outside who is okay with shanking a homeless man on the ground
Changing the name of a character does not imply they are a blank slate in any way. Sunny can never be a blank slate no matter what his name is, because the entire game still revolves around his backstory and emotions, all of headspace is still based on his memories, and he still has all of his character development around overcoming his personal trauma and telling his friends the truth.. . Changing his name is a method of allowing you to relate to him and imagine yourself in his shoes easier rather than feeling like you’re simply watching him go through the motions. It’s not to make you project on to him
Yeah, but the gender of the character doesn’t change that at all
fem sunny is a cute character design, but he's too much of an individual character to be customizable. i don't think you should be able to change his name either, it's weird when a woman plays through the game and has their name being referred to with he/him.
Do women who play the game put their own name though? The game does tell you you’re giving a name to a boy before you put the name in.
It’s not weird though cause most people didn’t use their real name. Even if they did I don’t really see it as a problem either way. Also, I didn’t even put my real name.
This was actually going to be a feature, but it was scrapped since it would've required the crew to draw everything twice. It would've been pretty neat, but I'm not heartbroken over it. (I remember seeing someone working on a mod to add the feature back in.). . I'm actually working on [my own hypothetical OMORI 2]() (an indirect sequel with a new story and characters) and, if it was a real game, you would be able to choose the protagonist's gender (with a non-binary option to boot).
Yeah, but what's the point (besides inclusivity)? You're playing as Sunny in the original and not yourself. I feel like making the player feel like the MC is a self insert detracts from the effectiveness of the game world. Like, the Mari reveal becomes less "oh god Sunny" and just a general "oh no".. . . . Dunno if I got my point across, but I tried.
>!It becomes less “Oh God Sunny” and more “Oh God, I Killed my sister!?” Which is a good thing. That’s exactly how you should feel because that’s how Sunny himself feels!<
i love this idea, but what exactly would the new emotions do? i can imagine that the sleepy one would have less speed and less defense or something but what would the others do? would more stats be added? would some emotions affect other party members or the energy bar?
>What exactly would the new emotions do?. . I haven't fully decided what they'd do, but I've had a few potential ideas:. . * Sleepy is more of a gimmick emotion; it would lower all stats, but it has an advantage over ***all*** other emotions aside from Neutral.. * Flattered and Disgusted are super effective against each other.. * Disgusted has the added downside of decreasing or outright preventing benefit from eating Snacks.. . Like I said, potential ideas.. . >Would more stats be added?. . Yes! Two to be exact: Special Attack and Special Defense. Basically, depending on the nature of the attack, the damage will be calculated using Atk/Def or Sp.Atk/Sp.Def (much like in other RPGs such as *Pokémon*). For instance, all standard attacks (and Skills like Rowan's Spin Kick) use the attacker's Attack against the target's Defense, but Skills like Cris's Storm Drain would use her Sp.Atk against the target's Sp.Def.. . This also applies to enemies. A punch, bite, scratch, weapon strike, or otherwise similar attack would be classified as physical, while an attack using sound, lasers, magic, or something of the like would be classified as special.. . Of course, Special Attack and Special Defense would be affected by emotions.. . >Would some emotions affect other party members or the energy bar?. . Perhaps. I do like the idea of emotions doing more than simply raising/lowering stats (like how Sad also has the added effect of converting Heart loss to Juice loss).
Yeah, it would have been nice  I'm okay with this and not okay with changing Sunny's name because changing Sunny's gender doesn't take away any meaning away from the game and isn't incredibly confusing.. . While changing Sunny's name causes the player to miss some symbolism and causes a good amount of confusion in players who changed Sunny's name.. . So as long as they don't change Sunny's personality, then yeah, it would have been nice . . However I would have definitely made sure to say that this is a male character you can make female, rather than a character that you can make male or female, to have a default (basically have it be somewhat treated like Sunny's name is in the fandom)
What is missed by changing his name?
The symbolism that was on the >!grave (the sun shinined brighter when she was here)!< is the best example
>!That's still a minor symbolism, and even by changing Sunny's name the game still shows you that his default name is Sunny. Also I personally think it's an interesting choice of game design to let the player choose the name of Sunny, because it makes the player understand that Sunny is the *actual* protagonist of this story without telling them anything.!<
I think most players would understand that Sunny is the main character >!after they wake up for the first time, or a least by the time of the first real real world sequence, because it is shown that the world you were just in was a dream by that character. And then you control them right after that, showing that they're not an NPC and that they are very likely the main character!<
>!I mean that, by directly showing that Sunny isn't called Omori, it already "separate" them in two different characters, which becomes very important in late-game, Omori being the embodiment of Sunny's repression and guilt!<
But not giving the option not only already does that, it *ensures* the player doesn't get the message wrong and names Sunny "Omori". . The MC has been being called "Omori" for all the time you've played, if later you are asked "What is the Protagonist's name," there's a high chance you would name him Omori. . About Sunny being the default option... Well, it's the same case with "Red," yet there's a lot of people who don't call him that
Sunny is a unisex name-
Yeah
that's interesting. i don't remember being  confused at all from changing his name. but i agree that his name should be fixed to Sunny
Pretty sure a girl can be named sunny as well lol
Not really, I wish his name was fixed to Sunny too. I kinda get annoyed when ppl change his name 😭 (Only exception being the 'Discord plays Omori', that was hilarious). I like Sunny feeling like his own character, and not like some sort of self insert. . . There's a scene near the end of the game where you're exploring Sunny's house and practically everything is interactable. And suddenly the text changes to first person, it's one of my favorite scenes. It really brought Sunny out as a character and made it feel less like I was playing a silent self insert protagonist.. . Like, if we also had the option to choose Sunny's gender it'd just wouldn't feel the same.
don't particularly care for it ngl
Same
As the #1 fem sunny fan, yes. Yes I do.
you aint the #1, i am
HOLY SHIT AUB!!!??
oops wrong account
Are we about to fight on who's the #1 because we can fight
It's interesting, but no. Omori is a very narrative and story driven game and I feel like it should be one or the other. I don't even like that you can change his name, I just typed in Sunny.
It honestly makes me annoyed when people change his name tbh
i understand why people do it, but i wish that you couldn't.
I think that being able to change his gender would make him more of a silent protagonist. Him being one defined gender with one design makes him feel like more of his own character.
Honestly, I like Sunny just staying male. It makes him feel less like a projection of the player and more of his own character, which is what he is supposed to be.
honestly? not really. he's a fleshed out character rather than a self-insert for the player, so imo it makes sense to keep him as is. i do like the fan ideas for a female version tho, just not for the game
I agree
I meann it would've been fun ? Tho I feel like the dynamic between Mari/Sunny would be different, but idk if that's just me 
It would be a cool feature to have but since im a male I can’t say it would make a difference to me.
No. I feel like that would make him less of an actual character. Omori is definitely not the kind of game that should have character customization options.
Tbh I wouldn’t have cared if Sunny was a girl, but it’s better to not have the option to choose imo
Honestly no, it may sound weird but I think that would strip Sunny of his individuality as a character. I think having any customization would kind of damage that and I honestly wish the player wasn’t able to name Sunny in the beginning because it gives this idea that he’s a self insert character despite him being anything but that.
That's like asking me as a trans person if I wants rights.. Yes please
I don't really care tbh, but it would've been cool
I feel like people would only go with male Sunny anyway because it’s canon
Hmm not really because in this game you are not the MC, you are watching someone else's story instead of writing yours. There is no need for character customisation imo as you are not making 'your character',it's an already existing character,and his perspective.
if it existed, people would ship omori x omori
No.
As much as I love fem Sunny and Omori's design, the game design doesn't make it practical enough for any payoff of changing the gender. I don't think it'd ruin the story at all, but it wouldn't really add anything to it either. I guess you could add the argument that girls are just as likely to experience being lonely shut-ins who have to fight with their mental health, but, like, we know. Yume Nikki is right there.
No, majority of the fandom would have a favoritism for girl Sunny and antagonize boy Sunny even more even though they’re the same Sunny.
honestly i'm kinda glad it didn't get added to the final game, because i feel like it'd make sunny feel less like his own character and more like a self-insert for the player
Not really cause all the stuff out now wouldn't really happen. Like all the art for merch and calendars and birthdays would be kinda weird and I've been enjoying all that. The game would feel kinda different IMO
I really couldn't care less about Sunny's gender honestly. And atleast that avoids discussion about "IS SUNNY MALE OR FEMAL OR TRANS" or what the heck ever includes the 578 gender thingie.
no
no
Ye
Eh kinda. Wouldn't change much story-wise besides maybe connecting with the main character some more.
Mfw Hikkiomori
Oh right it's just at the end of the game and in deep well mb lol
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes
that would be cool but you gotta love original sunny
Yes, I would like if this were a feature. FemSunny is a gift from god, but I totally see why it wasn't added. Apart from the "they didn't want to re-do everything" part, Sunny is a character that exists outside of the player. Having everything about them be customizable doesn't seem right
I mean I wouldn't mind it. Would be fun to try out both and all even if it has no mechanical differences, kinda like Sunny's name.. . . I get some people don't like changing it but I always enjoy it and outside of some minor symbolism players really don't miss out on anything of substance
No
not rlly
not really I mean the feature would be interesting but I don't really desire it, giving Sunny funny names is enough
Yes, pretty much.
While it is interesting, I don’t really see how it particularly adds much to the game. Sunny isn’t your average self insert MC >!even though the game does intentionally put you into a false sense is security that he is!<, so having the ability to have a choice of male or female doesn’t really do much in my opinion
hell nah, gives me an excuse to play as a guy without accidentally outing myself to my friends
not really tbh
I wish, it would be so cool
no
Not much of a practical point to it, just like the option to change Sunny's name.. . &#x200B;. . Could have been interesting though.. . &#x200B;. . ~~^(And now saying something that isn't really on topic: The official image is pretty cool.)~~
I mean yeah i guess, but like it wouldnt rly add too much to the story atleast for me because i dont see sunny as that "self insert" kinda character that is silent so you could feel like you're him. Sunny has a personality but y'know its not like adding it will ruin the game
No, Sunny is not a blank slate, we shouldn't even be able to change his name imo
No
Nah, I feel like not having options like this allow me to submerge into the character more if that makes sense, I personally prefer playing with a "real" character than a self insert one. Not having an option like this makes me feel like the story is objective and it allows me to take things more seriously
YES!!! IT'D BE SO COOL TO HAVE ONE
Day Sussy looking good ngl
Yup 
I think it's fine as is.  . . . >!Also, you can change his gender on the Hikikomori route!< 
I say no because he’s not supposed to be a self insert character. He’s his own character with his own story who may or may not be relatable to the player.
everything is better with a girl protagonist
No. It feels more immersive when you don't get to choose his gender. Yes, this female says it would be less immersive to choose to play as a female.
I mean pig tails sunny why not
It would have been cool, but also I can only shutter at how more...Passionate, the shipping in the community would have been lmao
No. Personally I think it changes too many character dynamics. Kel real world version makes less sense, Aubrey’s dynamic with sunny makes less sense. You could pull the sunny les, card but I feel like that’s reaching
The original plan for this was for picking female Sunny to also switch Kel to female and Aubrey to male, so I think the dynamics still would’ve made sense. There’s also some evidence that it would’ve switched Mari to male
Gender bending everyone is such a cop out though
Why there is 4 then?
I feel like it wouldn't make any difference at all, just ships going even crazier than right now
No because their gender doesn't matter.
it'd be nice but it doesn't really matter much imo since sunny/omori isn't meant to be a self-insert
Sometimes.
If we could female sunny would be called Elena or Selene
trans sunny
Yes but without the 12 year old in thighs highs
Never thought of it until now. But yes.
no cause it wouldn't add to the story, it was cut for a reason.
I don’t like the idea of putting such an impossibly high workload on such a small team. But if OMORI is due for a re-release (in like 5 years) I think it would be a good addition
I'm so done with this community
Not really, it's kinda pointless besides the curiosity of the designs, like how would male Mari look like.   What I wish for though was that changing Sunny's name wasn't an option. Though I'm glad I didn't.
Yeah!
No
Honestly I don’t mind not having options to change the gender. After all, this is a story about  Sunny and not about the player (which is why I wish the name was fixed).
Hello i am fucking zuma revenge what is your emerengengecy
so like option to gender swap all characters?
It would have been weirdly nice, plus if the other characters would also get gender swapped and like just a tiny tad different
No
ala people fighting for who Sunny gets shipped with
or just dont.
Cause people who like sunburn, people who like sunflower, and people who like suntan, usually absolutely fucking hate eachother. I ship sunburn, but FEEL like basil does like sunny but sunny doesn't reciprocate it and aubrey and sunny both like eachother. (Again, anyone else can have diff headcannons)
So that means omori-route-sunny has become Samuel Rodríguez from metal gear rising revengance
If the Omori wiki is anything to go by, then the specific dates in the photo album that match up with their days can only be possible in either 1991 or 1996 assuming that Omocat's original intention was the 90s. . . >!In one of the photos, Sunny can be seen playing with a handheld system that looks like a red Gameboy!<, red variants of the Gameboy didn't enter development until 1995. Which means that Omori takes place in 1996/2000. Sure, it could just be some made up handheld made for that specific photo, but I feel like the original intention was to base it off the Gameboy, as it was the most popular handheld at the time.. . Going by that, then Hero and Mari were both born in 1981, Kel was born in 1983 due to having his birthday after Sunny (the proclaimed "baby of the group") and Sunny, Basil and Aubrey would all be born in 1984. . . Hero and Mari would therefore be 43 this year, Kel would be 41 and the rest of the group would be 40.
The something but also here’s a wacky and cool tip for anyone doing an sunny/omori cosplay . . get a balloon and tie it to your back put a black cloth/other thing and an eye to make a something that follows behind you
snuuy
Sunny
Depends. What gender are you? What's your hair color? Who is your favorite character? These are all things you should consider before cosplaying. For example, I would cosplay Sunny as I look like him, I like him and I have all the clothes. 
The cat on Sunny’s head
Iirc correctly he was knocking on Sunny’s door every day for weeks, maybe months depending on how long the moving sign was up. Ik they never mentioned it in canon, but I could at least see him attempting to ask Sunny’s mom to play with him/if he was ok when he first locked himself inside
I wouldn't hate Sunny as a person but he does fucking >!shank Aubrey!<. Bro has no chill and can aspire to a decent career in London street crime. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone like that.. . . Actually fanart of Sunny as a roadman would be pretty funny now that I think about it.
well in behalf of a fictional character, >!sunny DID stay inside for 4 years!< and missed him so id think he'd listen if you said you wanted a day to yourself. But then again, get what u mean.
i think the sunny and not that i will hate him but i have a problem to get closer with people who are bad at expressing emotions
:(. but understandable.
Sunny. He doesn’t add anything to the friend group and just seems so fucking boring.
I think sunny was intentionally left open ended in some ways, so the player could kinda put themselves in his shoes
I agree, he very much is a faceless protagonist. It helps with the story, but still makes him dreadfully boring
You could also argue that Sunny wasn't SUPPOSED to be an interesting character- Basil actually points this out, saying that he's "simple" and "plain." Personally I think that's part of his charm-- the ability to just exist, and yet the people around him still love him all the same as the rest of the friend group. I could be completely wrong, so take everything I say with a grain of salt 😭
Honestly, Sunny. It is indescribably annoying how you can be so still and faceless in any conversation
sunny. Coward....
If anything I feel bad for Sunny lmao
.....because the game was in his pov
i like him as a character. he is a foil for sunny's complete innocence
Say hello to guilt.
She? And also I'm pretty sure the pictures shown in the ending of the game were in sunnys mind and not literal.
>He gave this trauma to *herself*, he did it to *herself* all because *she* chose watching someone absolutely die over saving a person’s life. . No, no you didn't.
Mclovin x sunny
What’re you working on?
damn bro couldn’t relate (I have no life)
This thread gave me a headache
thank you I am now going back to sleep for the rest of the day
What the hell is this thread
Can you tell me what's so funny about sexualizing children? I don't think I get it, but clearly you find humour in it  what's the punchline?. . If you saw the link, then how is most of what he said a joke? How is him admitting to seeking + 18 OMORI art a joke? How is him sending people + 18 art who ask for it a joke? How is him asking someone to send him an image of a body pillow that he was under the impression was + 18 a joke? How is him asking an artist to make him a + 18 body pillow of Sunny a joke?. . LMAO, dude got REAL quiet 💀
Bubbly made his entire character on this sub as a Sunny fan, and you don't believe he'd be making jokes like that?. . Can't wait for you to expose r/prequelmemes as a sub full of child murderers based on all the youngling jokes. . Also sorry for not spending all my time on reddit and not replying to immediately . . P.S nice ignoring the fact that you presented Bubbly praising an (not proshipping) art made by a supposed proshipper, as an "evidence"
You literally addressed nothing I said.. . Can you tell me what's so funny about sexualizing children? I don't think I get it, but clearly you find humour in  what's the punchline?. . If you saw the link, then how is most of what he said a joke? How is him admitting to seeking + 18 OMORI art a joke? How is him sending people + 18 art who ask for it a joke? How is him asking someone to send him an image of a body pillow that he was under the impression was + 18 a joke? How is him asking an artist to make him a + 18 body pillow of Sunny a joke?. . It's not hard to admit you're wrong dude, bringing up other subs/situations that are completely irrelevant in an attempt to change the topic is doing nothing for you. . Just say you're fine with people sexualizing children and go
I guess you never heard of such a thing as "comparisons". Anyway, reread my reply and try to understand this time
AGAIN, You literally addressed nothing I said.. . Can you tell me what's so funny about sexualizing children? I don't think I get it, but clearly you find humour in. what's the punchline?. . If you saw the link, then how is most of what he said a joke? How is him admitting to seeking + 18 OMORI art a joke? How is him sending people + 18 art who ask for it a joke? How is him asking someone to send him an image of a body pillow that he was under the impression was + 18 a joke? How is him asking an artist to make him a + 18 body pillow of Sunny a joke?. . Ignoring my points is getting you no where. Address them and answer my question, or we aren't going to be making any progress.. . . Just say you're fine with people sexualizing children and go, since you're closely having trouble trying to justify his actions
Whether the jokes are funny or not, is not important, what is important is that they're jokes and Bubbly doesn't mean what he says
You failed to address every single other point. This is a waste of time, I'm not going to bother arguing with someone who is so dead set on defending someone who has sexualized children multiple times. What a weird hill to die on 
When most of the comments he left in question were from cursedomori, a proship OMORI subreddit? Yes actually, it was pretty easy. Literally just go to that sub and sort by best. Go on any suggestive or + 18 post and you'll find a lot of his comments.. . >contexts of reality and fiction/jokes. . Can you explain in what context sexualizing children is okay? How about what's so funny about sexualizing children? What exactly is the punchline?. . Was Bubbly admitting to recognizing + 18 OMORI art because he was actively seeking that content out a joke? Was Bubbly offering to send people + 18 art in DMs a joke too? What about when he asked someone to send him an image of a body pillow while he was under the impression it was + 18? Oh yeah, when he asked an artist to make a double sided body pillow cover featuring Sunny, with a suggestive and + 18 side? Was he joking then?. . . Edit: Dude really complained about me supposedly "ignoring his arguments" and then continues to do just that 💀 you proshippers are such a joke
Shut up, I'm trying to discuss the love life of non existent people here!
I always headcannoned snuuy getting all the bitches
Again, well-traumatized enough teen here, I can still love people romantically or have relationships like anyone else. It’s not that weird/bad.. . But I also think Sunny wouldn’t feel like it rn even if he could, maybe after a little while.
There are other things like the swing seen and the fact Aubrey only told sunny about her home life because of the above that hint towards it.. . If she wouldn’t tell hero or Mari about it but say it too sunny it means it’s important
Personally, I'm not too fond of the ship, since I can't imagine Aubrey ever liking Sunny romantically. I can definitely see why people might find this pairing cute, though. The only thing that confuses me is why people treat it as objectively canon, when imo there really isn't enough evidence for that. It's definitely canon that Sunny has a crush on Aubrey, but I can't recall a single piece of evidence that even suggests she likes him back. In fact, out of the whole friend group, I feel like she and Sunny had some of the least one-on-one interaction in the game. It's been a while since my last playthrough, though, so feel free to correct me on this!
i guess shes more...affectionate? with sunny? or at least not as aggressive. . Its more of the past that people pair these two in particular. . did you know there is a lot evidince that sunny was the only one to ever see inside of aubreys house?. . he knew bun buns name before ever being there. . he knew EXACTLY was Aubrey's bed looked like too . . &#x200B;. . i just find it cute since they had there private meetins so aubrey can vent to sunny about her home life and her parents.. . also aubrey directly apoligises to sunny..she apoilgises broudly and to basil later. . but took time away from the group to say she should have been there for sunny only. . honestly such a cute moment. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . but im still fine if you dont vibe with it! there is plenty of ships i dont really vibe with either! . . if you just dont like a ship even with """""Evidence""""" its fine..like and hate whatever you want!
Ooh! Those are some interesting theories I've never heard before! And yeah, shipping anyone in this game is kinda complicated tbh, since 90% of ships would be a lil bit toxic unless we collectively pretend that the traumatic events of the game never happened, or that everyone got a TON of therapy lol. I appreciate the positive discussion about this, so thanks!
>I guess she’s more.. affectionate? With sunny, or at least not as aggressive. . See my reaction to that was that it’s probably because she feels bad for him or knows that he was probably affected the most by what happened as he was the closest to Mari. (And that he was isolated in his house for 4(?) years)
No it’s not canon that he *has* a crush, only that he *had* one.
Yeah I definitely agree with that, sorry I phrased it wrong!
I don't like it because idk, I just never really personally liked it. I mean, I think I just was kinda neutral on it but also just got a bit annoyed by it because it's the most popular sunny ship. I also do obviously have other ships I like for them, so that probably was part of it tbh.
No.. Why not?. . - Both Sunny and Aubrey get angry easily. I don't wanna know what will happen.... . - I feel like the present Aubrey dosn't suit for Sunny. He was in love with the 12 year old her. I doubt Sunny would still like her. He liked her when she was sweet and inocent. Now she is on a damn gang.. . -  I hate her.
I dont hate it but dont really like it either, like, it wont work... I know Sunny used to like her but that was at least 4 Years before the game,childhood crushes dont last forever. Sometimes she Is really mean to him and i feel like their relationship wouldn't work. In top of that, everyone in this game needs therapy, they should probably work on themselves a Lot More before even trying to romantically love Someone.
I like the art tho, it's pretty cute and wholesome
I am not that big into shipping.. . With that said, I think that's my favorite Sunny ship. It's the one that I can get behind more and the game already implies they both had mutual feelings at one point.. . Besides, THEY LOOK SO CUTE
^(Maybe I'm a bit biased because of all the sunburn fics I've read this past month), but;. . Aubrey is definitely the one to have the strongest reaction to the truth. Not because she hates Sunny or Basil, but because of who she is and how she's like.. . *However,* after thinking about it for not too long, she would empathize with Sunny because she'd realize that she **literally went through** ***the exact same thing days ago.***. . She pushed Basil into a lake product of a blind rage.. . Basil. The person she had been bullying for 4 years. The person she still thought had tried to erase their memories and hated him for it.. . *And she still felt like shit.*. . She would realize Sunny didn't mean to kill Mari. She would realize they went through the same pain of losing their older sister figure, but Sunny having the addition of feeling/being responsible. She would realize he just wasn't lucky to have he right person at the right place at the right time to undo their mistake.. . I don't know about Basil. Sunny was the one to black out the photos, so she wouldn't hate him from that side, but he still hung Mari's body. Not saying she wouldn't forgive Basil. Just she wouldn't come around to it as easily as to Sunny.
Unpopular opinion but the gang pretending that Sunny had nothing to do with the framing is laughable.. . Like, do people honestly believe that they'd ignore his involvement in that, especially considering that it ultimately his actions that were being covered up?. . Like, seriously Sunny looks *extremely* bad in this situation.
>You hear shuffling. You hear dragging... and creaking... and pulling. [...] you refuse to look away from the leaves.. . -Truth Album. . Sunny wasn't awake after killing Mari and dragging her body to her bed. He was daydreaming and looking at a tree, refusing to believe it was real. He didn't even know Basil waa there the whole time until *after* the hanging. (Thus, "The Stranger" exists). . Sunny is the only one who killed Mari. Basil is the only one who hanged Mari's body.. . Plus, Basil framed a suicide to help Sunny, you think he wouldn't tell them the truth about how Sunny had no doing in the framing? I don't think it's confirmed whether Basil was awake during The Truth, but when he learns that Sunny confessed, the first thing he'll do is get some blame away from him
1) That's scrapped content and thus not  canon. . . And even if it was, certain entries imply Sunny was *very much aware* that what they were about to do is horrible. He did it anyway. . . 2) Sunny *definetely* helped carry the body.. . 3) Basil's reaction isn't nearly as easy to gauge as you think. Up until this point he quite literally didn't not know it was Sunny to begin with.. . There's really no telling how he'd react, and no telling how much the others are even willing to believe him in the first place. . . Not to mention that saying Sunny had nothing to do with it is flat-out wrong.
"They went through the same pain of losing an older sister" . Huh?
Dislike. All the semi canon will they won't they is within sunny's dreams. In reality sunny traumatized her, disappeared for a year, and re-emerged only to immediately stab her with a knife. They are not in love.. . Add to that, I'm very queer, and I can say from experience that nobody is sleeping with a picture of another girl next to her bed if they're just friends.
I like it because Sunny canonically had and prolly still has a crush on Aubrey. . . And it's also slightly hinted in game that Aubrey, might have a crush on Sunny too, but, that's mainly because of that dialogue she has at Sunny's house and that's not really supporting evidence.. . Though, I don't think a relationship would work out after Sunny finally tells the truth.😅
No - I don’t hate it or have any strong feelings about people who ship it, to each their own and all. But personally, I think that letting his childhood feelings for Aubrey go is an important part of Sunny’s healing and accepting reality for what it is. . . To be perfectly honest, I don’t think there’s much chance of them realistically working out after Sunny reveals the truth either with Aubrey having anger issues and her own trauma she needs to work through and Sunny only just starting to come to terms with what is incredibly complex PTSD connected to childhood memories of his friends. Maybe if they reconnected in the future there’d be a chance there, but it’s a really complicated situation even so.. . That said, I do like Sunkel a lot. Probably because Kel is (oddly enough) so down to earth and well-adjusted, given the circumstances.
no, at the beginning of the game/THREE DAYS LEFT sunny stabs aubrey and later on even pepper sprays her and the hooligans, and even if she did apologise and found that she still has a crush on him...somehow...I feel like after sunny tells the truth she'll just lose interest cause he literally >!killed her sister figure.!< and I also don't think either of them are ready to be in a relationship, like there'd just be a tense and awkward air between them..but that's just my opinion and I don't hate on people who ship it.
>at the beginning of the game/THREE DAYS LEFT sunny stabs aubrey and later on even pepper sprays her and the hooligans. . İt's optional. So it's not important. even if you choose these options, the hooligans and Aubrey can talk and hang out with Sunny as if nothing had happened
my opinion, I don't like it because I think it's a little toxic, because sunny stabbed her and for me she's a lesbian. But in childhood it's cute.
>because sunny stabbed her. . İt's optional. You can beat Aubrey with just Kel.
I know that, but I don't think it would be a good couple, like Sunny doesn't show feelings for her anymore only in childhood.
>like Sunny doesn't show feelings for her anymore only in childhood.. . . Sunny imaged for 4 years that Aubrey had crush on him. and even though Aubrey insulted him in the real world, that continued that night.
sunny imagines that Aubrey has a crush on him in the dream world, and she still has a crush on him only in the game he doesn't just show it in childhood. During these four years he owes overcoming+
I think he doesn't like her anymore.

They’re ok, definitely closest to canon. But out of all of the Sunny ships it’s my least favorite, just find the dynamic a bit boring I guess? Still respect the ship
thats cool! some ships just dont vibe with some peeps!
What’s your favorite sunny ship. There is only one right answer.
I think it's my favorite Sunny ship... It just has the best chemistry... I always love the canon ships the most bcz normally they have the most amount of content. Although this isn't confirmed 100% canon I think we have enough evidences to point that this was probably the intended ship for Sunny. Not really a fan of Kel x Sunny or Basil x Sunny cuz they just seem best friends to me, at least I've never seen Sunny demonstrating some romantic attraction to Basil (although I can see it sometimes in Basil's actions lol) and Kel is just a real bestie. I kinda see the Kim x Aubrey working out but we don't really have evidences, same for Kel x Aubrey, I could see that perfectly happening but the way it was presented it reminded me of siblings relationship
It’s Kinda Canon And I Like It . . Sunny Gets Those Albanian Bitches 🇦🇱😎
I like it.. . 1. Sunny likes her in game.. 2. Maybe Aubrey likes him? She at least seems to care about him.. 3. They both got serious problems. They should have serious problems together.. 4. Its cute.. . Everything else for Sunny seems really forced.
its not my favorite ship with sunny but i think its cute. i think his little crush on her was a nice little touch they added to add to his character
Just like every other Sunny-centred ships, I enjoy the cute art of it, but I don't have any opinions on it
I want Sunny to be happy.
I’m alright with it. All three of the main Sunny ships are fun, albeit not without some baggage simply owing to the nature of the game. . . It’s obviously got the most canon support, with Sunny’s crush on Aubrey well-established and some definite hints of reciprocation.. . I’d definitely call it my least favorite of the three, though I don’t hate it by any means. For one, you’d have to imagine >!she’d have the hardest time forgiving Sunny post-good ending. It can be hard to see their dynamic working out with the truth out in the open. If she gave Basil, her oldest friend, so much grief over just the photo album… yeah.!<
I like them because they >!seemed to have the same relationship with Mari- Sunny was her brother and Aubrey was like a little sister to her. Also they're cute together and I'm pretty sure that it's mentioned in the game that Sunny had a crush on her!<
canon and aight ig, but dont think sunny is ready for any relationship so
no because sunny doesn't have time for girls he's busy doing jobs and>! committing terrible acts against his will!<
I mean, Sunny is pretty definitely the virgin in the virgin vs Chad meme.
It's real sunny up here, but I do like a little bit of... SHAAADE
It's called "Something" and it's just inside Sunny's mind ( not real). . Continue playing the game so you could understand it better
Yes
Damn, i should stop joining subreddits from games that i want to play in the future 😭
dont worry, i got spoiled too and still cried at the ending :3. . its about the journey!!
The good ending is devastating even if you already know it. The bad endings are worse 🙃

Nothing. The screen in black. He wants to stare at himself. Blankly.
I imagine that he uses it as an excuse not to socialize and is just hoping no one notices
That seems like something Sunny would do.
You stare at the blank screen. OMORI stares back at you…
There is no confirmed date, but there are a few hints that indicate it's in the late 2000s. For example, in Sunny's house there is a 90's style computer that Sunny depicts as an old computer. Furthermore, Gameboys were in circulation for a lot while and this things are durable as hell.
My headcanon is that the incident took place in 1999 and we start playing in 2003(already said why)but there is no proof about it being the 2000s sadly :(
Yes there is!(i think) 
so even crazy fox supports the idea of it being 1999 ~ 2003 in the comments but Then this makes no sense from merch and in-game evidence
Sunny would definitely be

Not trying to sound like an ass, but honestly, I'm doing what I think is fun.. . . And edit: Rule 1 is literally to respect others and stay civil. What you said isn't respectful or civil, it's just purely rude. For a mod, that's technically breaking the rules you were assigned to go by, and direct others to follow. Not cool.
Plus it's a fun discussion post. No harm in that! I honestly loved reading these answers!

Where do I even start...   so, WAS it bad that I ignored Aubrey during the night? Were the "shadows" surrounding basil just in sunnys head? And what did they represent? Was basil the villain or sunny? What did it mean when sunny sat on the throne or chair with, I think, surrounded by hands?
Ahh, so Sunny was just hibernating 
*y e s*
One of my least favourite aspects about the game is that you can change his name. He feels less like a character because of it, so symbolic parts like that mean so much less upon reading.. . Sometimes I wish he was like Omoriboy, He had an actual personality but they scrapped it so he could be a more relatable, silent protagonist, self-insert, type of character. I think the game flows better if you choose to name him Sunny because that’s who you’re actually playing as, not yourself.

Nah, he is probably different around people his age and the memories Sunny has of him are from years ago, he’s definitely matured and changed by the time he’s in college
Sunny and the others cause him to regress into a less mature state from before *something* happened, got it. . (/s)

The real issue is that he responded too quickly with stabbing that making everyone uncomfortable.
Better strike first and finish things off, I'm too weak to fight back in this moment.
Suntown. AKA Sunny X everyone in town
That sounds very crack xd
Sunny being actively social
I want friends.
>!sunny's suicide!<
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!.
Sunny after four years of isolation
Kim: Woah Aubs is this your old friend?, he looks like a thin wraith.. . Sunny... what happened to you?.. . (I think I should have done more than just knock on the door in all that time).. . ... why?.. . Vance: Yo kid, Do you want to come with us to Gino's?.

 How dare you!?.
Well Sunny’s not in this picture so…….
POV: 
They went to a Pizza Place in 1983 for Sunny's Birthday
... ... oh god no
Sunny smiling
FINALLY!
>!sunny’s after the bad ending!<
Oh how sad :(


>!Sunny x Omori!< shippers
Sunny telling them how he trimmed his nails for 4 years (he was biting them)
What ya mean? . . I dunno, siblings who fight a lot? Lovers who express their love for each other with violence? rivals for Snuuy's attention?. . or the thing that Kevin7650 said
>siblings who fight a lot?. . that's just siblings, fighting each other, but caring for each other, if that's not what your siblings act like, then they are not good siblings, or they don't fight
sunnys a 16 year old dude. he can thirst over a doughnut if he wants; its like the least weird thing about him honestly.
do you think he goons to wanting to pork the donut hole.
Genuinely what did I just read
:(
Sunny has an unrestricted access to the internet, soooo...
The slime girls literally wanted to make Omori and his friends pets... You can see what he thinks about
should i ask if bro'd like it?
I want to know. . 

It's a more normal thing to be in his mind than a whole lot of the rest.
This image made it really click to me how much stuff might be a Sunny gooner fantasy.
Thank goodness we never get to see White Space 2
There's a reason it's white
Just because you can only play blackjack on it *in game* does not mean that Sunny only uses it for blackjack
Alr you got a point byt why I got downed for -7 bro just this is harsh💔
I love how he doesn't hold any grudges against Sunny and just wants to fight
Why does that sound so adorable? Fighting is not adorable!
Counter point: Sunny decides to breathe a lot
BREATHE, SUNNY, YOU'RE IMMORTAL
Angel in the second fight can dish out a lot of damage so he'll probably run out of breath eventually
chaotic neutral
The story revolves around them, smh, just because ur sister died sunny doesn't mean you HAVE to be a PROTAGONIST, give others the spotlight smh...
what i’m saying 
Oh well I guess I just forgot. I'll replay the Sunny route after I finish the Omori route and see all the things I've missed in RW because there are a lot.
Tanking with Sad is a good strat if you can still manage to land hits and not die, otherwise it's gotta be *A N G E R Y*. . I never really like using Happy because of the decreased Hitrate, but I'm also still pretty early in the game. And on the Sunny route
Is it perhaps because I am also a sunny enjoyer?
You along with a few other users seem to be stalking (not in the bad sense) me.
well tbh he is already man look at the rest of the cast. . &#x200B;. . sunny is supposed to be like chronically pale
sunny singing about depression while looking at his reflection in the water.
Yeah, especially that anime studios have better record of game adaptation, even if mostly visual novels. It would be pretty easy to nuke the mood tho, the 2nd person messages did a lot for immersion. And try to imagine Sunny speaking to his friends in anime voice…
Well considering since anime is obviously made in Japan, all of their voices would be just Japanese and stuff. In English dub tho, I have no idea how they would sound like
This isn’t what I meant by anime voice, although I see how that wasn’t clear. Anime has very over the top, performance kind of voice acting. I speak a little Japanese and while I was still studying I had an opportunity talk to native speakers – they just don’t talk like that. I am yet to meet a Japanese person that wouldn’t warn me about learning pronunciation from anime.. . To think of it, for Sunny they would probably go to the other extreme – something like Rei from Eva.
Oh you mean the over exaggeration of anime voices? Oh yea definitely, all Japanese people do not talk like that so I get what you’re saying
It would have to take place in prehistoric times, headspace is old and hosted many dreamers before Sunny
the idea is kinda good, it would be interesting, but i think it's hard to tell the story without it's game format, because it'll kinda lose it's main focus, for example, the player's decision about the things that happen in-game, which makes it much less interesting to watch, because i think the focus in Omori is how the player will take care of sunny's last days in faraway town, like, you could make sunny overcome his fears and fight his trauma, not help your friends or even leaving the house at all, unless if netflix make an interactive series, but even if they do it, it'll still not be good like the original game, because you still lose the option of choice, this is why i like the concept of creating based on the game's story, but i think it'll not be good, because you can't choose sunny's path to overcome trauma
it should 🙄 imagine an entire new group of friends when sunny moves
It could work showing the entire story(s) from a different angle, perhaps having some of the other endings are in daydreams or thinking of things going differently? >!Like the final battle and the episode initially cutting short with a bad ending fakeout, credits and all before it coming back to it being Sunny thinking about what might happen if he gives up!<
everyone in the gangsta until sunny was voice by chris pratt
I commonly see people say “why didn’t you do nothing” or why didn’t he cal 911” as if the exact same things can’t be applied to sunny
Sunny is the one who actually >!killed her though!<, so do you hate Sunny too or is it just Basil because he tried to help with what Sunny did? You act like Basil is the one who >!killed Mari!< but Basil wouldn’t have >!hung her!< at all if Sunny wouldn’t have >!pushed her down the stairs!< in the first place.
agreed but I think it might be a better idea to spoiler the whole message rather than just the keywords
The difference is that one was a single wrong action in a single moment without any intention of harm that had inadvertently caused everything to go wrong, while the other was a much longer series of actions that could have been backed out of at any time yet wasn't because the intention to commit to the action was fully there. The two aren't comparable.
Sunny was just as capable of backing out as Basil was, >!he could have said no to Basil’s idea or called an ambulance himself but he did neither.!< You can’t just put that all on Basil like he was the mastermind and Sunny had no choice against him, because he did. . . Sunny was the one who agreed with Basil’s suggestion and went through with it. Sunny is just as guilty as Basil is for how they handled what happened >!after the push!<.. . People only give Sunny a sympathy pass because we play as his character. Realistically, Sunny is much worse than Basil is for that incident. >!He basically added insult to injury by not only killing his sister, but also agreeing with his best friend that they should hang her instead of calling someone for help. Sunny was the main person who gained from Mari being hung because he knows he would have gotten in big trouble otherwise. Basil was just a spectator before his suggestion so he gains nothing other than keeping Sunny out of jail, which also just benefits Sunny.!<
Thought he hanged her due to Sunny's impulsivity.. I dont feel like he's really the one to blame, when he just wanted to help a friend while under tremendous stress.. . Not to say he's totally innocent, but legally Basil would be the accomplice to Sunny by doing criminal scene staging, while Sunny has to account for third degree murder or manslaughter.
I figured the reason he did it was to try and protect Sunny, because he was afraid of losing him. . . Sunny definitely seems to be his best friend before the incident. And Basil has a rough family life, so he really relies on Sunny for interpersonal connectivity.. . When Sunny kills Mari, Basil's first thought is that he doesn't want to lose Sunny. He can't lose Sunny, since Sunny means so much to him. Which is why he comes up with the plan to hang her. If everyone thought she killed herself, and didn't know Sunny did it, then Sunny wouldn't go to juvie for murder, and he'd not lose Sunny. . . Of course, we see how this works out, with Basil still losing his connection to Sunny after Sunny becomes a shut-in. But Basil was 13, emotionally troubled, and absolutely terrified. He panicked, and this was the plan that he came up with, the one that he thought would let him stay friends with and keep seeing Sunny.
it's be a good idea to spoiler this
If Basil didn’t offer to hang her then he wouldn’t have had any crime to cover up because it would be Sunny’s crime, not his. He just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sunny is the one who deserves hate more than anyone else honestly. . . Also he was a literally child when that happened, you can’t expect a child to think 100% rationally and do the smartest option at all times. Especially in a very sudden and panicked state of mind, I wouldn’t expect anything else from him. When you’re caught in the moment of such a tragedy, realistically, you really don’t have time to think of every option and which would be the smartest thing to do in that moment. Your brain just thinks of the first thing and goes with it.
Yes, I know, and I'm not blaming him for that, it's just that I'm repeating words of someone even if I don't agree with them
Why are you repeating words from someone you don’t agree with?
Why does that matter?
Because it doesn’t make sense logically. What purpose does it serve for you to repeat someone else’s words when you don’t even agree with them? What do you gain from it?
Sunny was Basil's best friend, and probably the closest person to him in the moment. His first thought when it happened was probably that he didn't want to lose sunny, if he >! left the body !< as it was it would've been way more obvious, so what he did was to "put the blame on something else" (that being >! Mari herself !< )
I get he should have responsibility for his actions BUT he was also a child HE WAS 12 WHEN IT HAPPEND WHAT THE HELL WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE HOME ALONE WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND AND THEY KILL SOMEONE?. . Of course he doesn't wanna admit to the murder OF HIS BEST FRIENDS SISTER HE'S 16 sure taking responsibility for your actions is the right thing to do. . but in his defense he doesn't want to go to jail or be despised by the only one who defends him being Kel. . admitting to it would ruin his life and sunny already outed him. . so there's no point in telling the truth because they already know. . telling the truth back before that would just make things worse for him AND sunny. . and it would make sense for him to be scared of sunny he did witness him kill someone after all even if he did help out with hiding how it happened it's still a very traumatic event. . and sunny is directly connected to it BY BLOOD just being in sunny's house would probably make him breakdown. . the story is pretty realistic it's not meant to make him have a heroic turn he's just a person who is mentally ill. . he's not supposed to be the hero he was simply involved in a horrible event yes he could have handled things better but he was just a kid at the time. . and having that much weight on your back and admitting to it is a really really hard task could you imagine dealing with the weight of knowing you've helped kill your best friend sister?. . Not to mention that much trauma would mess with some ones head he can't think clearly he hallucinates basil's behavior completely replicates that of someone who is traumatized. . the game is supposed to replicate what it's like to be traumatized it is not a fairy tale. . it's psychological horror you're not supposed to like how they act the game is supposed to be realistic. . as someone with CPTSD it is a perfect replica of what it's like to be traumatized it was like looking at a mirror of my younger self it was the first game that actually spoke to me. . trauma isn't fun having to deal with what they went through isn't going to be fun it's scary it's dark it's sad. . and if you still don't believe me I hope you never find out what it's really like to live through trauma that bad
>!because he cut Sunny eye!<
I mean.. he was having a mental breakdown and thought he was fighting off Something. Did you think he was killing sunny because he hates him or something? Or do you think he was a bad person because of that situation that was out of his control at that point?
Step 1: The accident was a sunny problem. . Step 2: Someone misread the situation. No pictures were taken, the truth sequence is entirely memories.. . Step 3: Well, this one isn't wrong, but it's important to remember that he didn't realize that sunny didn't do it. He thought that SOMETHING did this. He's not calling the police to help with the demon problem.. . Step 4: Refer to step 2. . Bonus step: Basil had no ill intent toward sunny. He was trying to kill something. He obviously wasn't in the right state of mind in any case.
I'm messing around, why am I getting down voted?
Sorry, probably partially my fault. I didn't realize.
Don't worry, I think differently to a lot of people, and when I share my thoughts, people hate me fore it, I have -60 Karma, I've only just started using reddit too. I'm misunderstood all the time, but thanks for accepting it.
(Sunny's) eyes. (One) of them. (Injured) it. Wasn't actually trying to harm Sunny.

I just... Don like him, is not a hate feeling is more like a wasted and bad use of him >!I never got why is he the "Best friend" to sunny when kel or auby felt more connected to sunny, I feel like the story try to sell us that basil is our best friend and just that... We never saw a true moment to justify why is he considered our best friend. He just feels like the good and fragile friend. And when he came with the century idea of hanging mari, well I liked the plotwist but like I said, it feels "forced" to consider him good. Even, I don't really get why the famdom loves him when doesn't has a good development in real world aside being a selfish with the rest of the group!< Maybe I'm wrong here in lore but yeah. I don't like him and compare him as a ralsei from delarune
No characters are good in the story you can make the forced argument for everyone but Aubrey felt closer cause sunny had a crush on her and kel was the most social.
Yeah, I just focused the excuse in brasil to try to explain his relation 
On the first playthrough he felt like a plot device to me, we didn't have enough time to bond with him like the others because he had significantly less screentime. I also couldn't think of a single plausible explanation for why a kid would >!have the messed up idea of staging an accidental death as suicide!<. . On followings playthroughs his motivations began to make more sense, and I can appreciate the tragedy of this character. But he was still not given enough time to redeem himself in the eyes of the viewer like Aubrey or Sunny, who we have seen feel extremely guilty at their actions.. . I know the whole point of the game is seeing Omori/Sunny's POV, but I think it would have helped Basil's character to see a few more scenes in his POV to add to his depth.
I actually don't hate him because we don't get much of him in RW. I'm actually glad we don't have to be around that little psychopath more than we need to . . I'm not gonna spoil anything, but the fact that, when the incident happened, his first course of action was literally playing Hangman with the affected is f up beyond understanding. I may forgive Sunny, not him. At least Sunny did it on accident, Basil literally went "aight let's..." well, you know the rest
I hate him because he stabbed snuuy
He copied Sunny’s drip
I don’t hate him honestly, while I have yet to play the game myself I feel like he gets way more depth in the stories I read. So I don’t hate him myself, while I don’t like his ship with Sunny and I do feel like he gets a little to attached to Sunny from what I’ve seen I don’t hate him
sunny at the vest 🤯
It’s unknown, but I kinda doubt that Sunny killed Mewo, given that he has her in white space(maximum security for Sunny basically) and also there’s only one room alluding to what happened. . She probably died of semi natural causes, like being hit by a car or euthanized, or is just somewhere else
Sunny definitely didn’t kill her intentionally. It makes sense for her to be put down, and him to still feel responsible, or maybe he forgot to feed her and care for her in the FOUR YEARS in his room.
>!My personal headcanon is that Mewo got aggressive after Mari died and would attack Sunny (hence the Hushpuppies in Breaven), so the mom had her put down (hence the operating table in Blackspace). When she explained this to Sunny, he blamed himself (hence blackspace).!<
Or she’s in blackspace cause sunny saw her get put down
Sunny ate him in a rage after his mom took away his PS4
 consume
So that’s why the steak made him sick!
Are you suggesting the steak was made with… oh god
🍽🐈‍⬛
Snuuy 🙏🙏

Either Sunny’s mom took her with because Sunny can barely take care of himself let alone remember to feed a cat, or >!because of the black space table she could’ve been euthanized.!< Or she might’ve just ran off given there’s tons of stray cats in Faraway.
i always thought sunny’s mom just took him to the new house
>!It's in memory lane but after crossroads, and crossroads happens after Basil stabs out Sunny's eye. So I assume that's all happening in Sunny's head.!<
>!oh I forgot about that you right!<
İf toy box in real world is not there . Why door is disappear
what?
Yes, but Sunny >!hallucinated the closet door to vanish, so chances are the violin remains and the toybox are still there.!<
I think Sunny’s mother is now taking care of her though Sunny misses her a lot. Or maybe Sunny’s father is taking care of her and Sunny now feels guilty because of that, hence >! the black space room where you can kill her. It must almost feel like he actually did it after all !<
Either with Sunny’s mom in the city, or dead
Sunny ran out of steak one night...
#WHY
for my own happiness i say she went with Sunny’s mom to the new house
She’s with Sunny’s mom in the new house
Cause sunny stabbed him and sliced him open
Because she's a major part of Sunny's personal hell that he had created, constantly reminding him of his misdeeds with intrusive thoughts that appear randomly and linger until he goes back to the safe space that is killing him.
: I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Sunny ○ -> □

Sunny looks as offended as the other 3, so I don't think sunny's guilty of whatever affront to humanity their eyes were cursed with. I'm personally going with the latter option.
Note: Sunny does not get a frame with that face. I may or may not be wrong, if you think I am prove it.
most likely something that was made just in case sunny ever had any speaking lines, now for the few he has they're either stylized cut scenes or something not really worth a character portrait anyways (looking at you "PIZZA DELIVERY!!!!!"), sunny's a silent protag with an actual established character so it's possible he was planed to have far more dialog at some point earlier in development, this is a very common thing in rpgs, mcs often get portraits they don't use.
Well yes, Omoriboy aswell was a talking protagonist from what I've seen in the comics so it is truly possible this is the case.
Sunny making that pose while still showing no emotion is hilarious
Sunny was able to access the internet on his computer
... ... ... uh oh
Omori 2: Omoriboy
"SUNNY invented gravity."
They saw Pin talking about Sunny’s Mom. 

"Your mom your mom your mom"
Japanese cat day thats why there was Sooooo many cat sunny and cat omori arts from jpanese community
The images on sunny's laptop
: I'm in the age of... ...you know.
Honestly, I have no idea! I'm not sure there's something horrible enough *on this planet* to make 16 year old Sunny react like that. *Maybe* >!Basil's suicide,!< but even that I doubt.. . &#x200B;. . Maybe they >!went back in time and saw Mari's death and coverup in person? I think even though he's seen it before that might be enough for Sunny to make that face.!<
But she is like Sunny... a cat 
That's called an Ahoge. It means stupid hair. I guess that means Sunny is stupid
Seems dangerously easy to mistake that word for another one 
Like two comments above [this is going on]()
no I was calling Sunny stupid (ahoge is also known as 'idiot hair')
And I was just kidding
I knew what you ment
It symbolizes that sunny grows up and becomes L Lawliet from Death note
Lomori, Sunny’s little brother that no one remembers
lsunny
Sunny precisa engolir o choro e fazer o L
Luminace (because he's Sunny, get it?)
Live Sunny reaction: 
*Sussy
He's teasing Sunny 1000000%
9999999999% chance 
“You like Krabby Patties, don’t you Sunny?”
He thought of a math problem that he thinks Math nerd Snuuy can’t solve.
When he sees that Sunny booty

Because he caught Sunny's eye 👀
He’s looking at Sunny on his bed.
He saw sunny’s nuts
~Sunny~ Sussy
He made Sunny flustered
sunny dropped the soap
Sunny. That's all I need to say.
Sunny's coming to visit and he's gonna come out
He saw sunny
He got mad Sunny abandoned him so he told everyone what really happened (I don’t know what he thought would happen to Sunny if people found out (spoiler alert: it’s actually nothing he was 12) but it’s probably something drastic, and now he just is gleeful about it)
Sunny defeated the 'homophobia' fear
and Sunny finally said he'd join him
sunny kinda looks like alan from smiling friends in the last picture
SOMETHING being wrapped around Sunny's throat is a pretty raw metaphor
It's so good I love metaphors.
Two clues: 'SUNNY I LOVE YOU" and the Heaven sequence.
Which route?
[. . [
Sunny
Imma say Sunny
I think it’s Snuuy
Babil rented an aircraft carrier to destroy sunny's house to get rid of the stairs incident evidence (successful)
I am hyper focused on that damn sunny plushie I need him now 🙏🏼
Emotional Support Snuuy!
"'I will just be their emotional support,' SUNNY thought, as he sat sleepily in the front jacket pocket."
What did they do with Sunny.
It's like that with the sunny plush too on his clothes
The new batch of plushies is honestly terrible quality
Did they change them or is it just 1 or 2 batched defected ?
I think it's a new company making the current plushies
Well i guess i couldn't save up fast enough for one 
Give him a friend (Preferably Sunny)
just need to wait for them to restock...
***Overall***. . Your very own Basil as stated by other helpful *Headspacians/Farawayicans* will require a friend, preferably Sunny. I'd also advise getting your very own Mari to help make your own Sunny feel better in the event that they become miserable. ***IF*** you live in a staired building, please refrain from allowing Sunny to be placed above the stairs, as Sunny is known to be a risk to himself and others on stairs.. . ***Recommended Items***. . Recommended items for you to give to basil include a Camera (preferably a Polaroid OneStep Land Camera so that he feels right at home with it!), Garden Shears (Supervise him in the case that he's holding one), Seed Packets (Buy ALL the seed packets, Basil needs variety...), Fertilizer (He'd probably like to sniff it), A nice watering can (Of his choice), pots (number and variety of his choice), and more. Naturally you'll need to include a Sunny for Basil to hangout with, for Sunny the following items are necessary, An entire steak knife kit (Supervise him, every singular DAY), his own little microwave (Easybake, for his safety), non stringent rations of steak produce (Approximately 2-4 pieces of Steak a day, type of steak will be Sunny's choice), A Violin (Please supervise him, give him encouragement, comfort him!), appropriate sheet music (Again, comfort him, pamper him, love him!), his own little bed (He loves sleep, please get him a bed of his choice), a computer (Only load it with Shark Blackjack, for his mental safety), and more. Obviously with Sunny you'll need Mari as he'll most likely feel alone without her, unless you confirm with him that he is satisfied with ***SOMETHING***. In the event that you acquire a Mari, she'll require the following. A piano (Watch her play, maybe even duet with Sunny, break up any arguments that may occur with them), appropriate sheet music (It's simply a must!),  a Picnic basket and sheet, a baking kit, and supplies (Enjoy the delectable cookies!) and more.. . ***Caring Regiment***. . This applies to all of your little Faraway/Headspace friends, here are the Dos and Don'ts.. . ***DOs***. . * Do shower them with love, comfort them, refrain from rushing them, or arguing with them.. * Do make an attempt to keep peace between the trio (or more) when conflict arises.. * Do feed them their designated food items. Basil: Tofu, Plant Products, and more. Sunny: Steak, Meat Products, Cookies, and more. Mari: Fruit Assortment, Cookies, Baking Material, and more. You may also provide them with the occasional Gino's Pizza Pie.. . ***Don'ts***. . * Don't dirty them, wash them but be gentle with it.. * Don't be harsh when you wish to manually relocate them.. * Don't purposefully cause conflict within the trio (or more).. * Don't neglect any of their needs.. * Don't allow me to catch you attempting a Don't.. . Made with care by me, good luck with your own little Basil! 
I can't imagine how much work went into making this, I really really love it. I'll try my best to follow the guide!! thanks for all the help <3
omg from where is it
I wanna know too
It will be a family heirloom
i got one too!! im thinking of displaying it as a tapestry instead of using it as a normal blanket c:. also ur bed looks so cute and cozy!
That's a good idea! I wanted to do that too, but my walls are full of posters, so I have no room
That’s pretty cool. I’ve always wanted to sleep with Sunny’s inner demons.
That's the coolest thing! Where did you get this?
i dont need it i dont need it i dont need it i dont need it
Its sunny
He is a Cutie
True…
Sunny. Definitely.
That Sunny is NOT making it out alive bro🥀. . 
LMAO
i think its sunny
Do what sunny does and get random side quest jobs
damn poor snuuy :(
Stand? Is that a Jojo reference? Did Sunny use his stand Reverie of Duet against Omori’s Hands of Time?

I bought a new sunny one and ooof it’s pretty bad.. they mad him fat and his clothes can’t stay on without looking awkward, and his belly sticks out it’s pretty funny
Sunnyshaming... . . 
I’m sorry Sunny 😣
Good roadkill. 
Do you have an image? I’m curious to see how he looks like lol
Not at the moment but I’ll get some soon!!
this gave me a good laugh please show us how it looks
"Sunny, what the hell is friend inside me!?"

Maybe my standards are on the floor, but I think he looks cute lol
he’s definitely better than a lot of the sunnies I’ve seen but i still think my original one on the right looks better ….
Oh for sure yours looks better lol
ugly or not he is still beautiful and i am very satisfied …… i know my friend will be pleased
Same! Id be super pumped to get him too lol
I kinda like the new one better, the lower face placement makes him look more like the character in the game. The original ones look like they have huge chins, mine included.
Did you say... Big chins?. . 
They probably just gave him some more stuffing, compared to the first Sunny plush you’ve got. also I see at the corner of my eye an Aubrey plush lol unrelatedly
yes……that’s one of the plushies from my actual collection….. . 
If its because of stuffing you can take a risk cut it take stuffing out and sew it back right?
Idk, mine looks alright, he even absorbs power. . 
Idk it looks normal to me
i think his face is just Really low on his head and that’s what’s tripping me up
Haven't noticed that
NOOO DON’T SAY THAT
it’s in a loving way
Get him on ozempic he looks obese
I knew he's been eating away his problems!
sorryy... Which is the supposingly uglier one? They book look cute to me ... Can't even tell which is the bootleg one ....
the bootleg one is the one who has boots instead of legs. . i hope it helps
neither of them are bootlegs Actually but the one on the left is the one I’m talking about 😅
Both of them looks adorable actually.... I've seen terrible ones on taobao AliExpress. The fringe is hideous hahahaha
if they made a bootleg sunny I would have totally just got that but they ONLY did omori and both basils . there’s the bigger bootlegs also but those r only headspace + sweetheart …..
I found a bootleg sunny on taobao thou.. it's around $10 Singapore dollar. Do u want the link? 😂
I have send u the link thru private chat! Do check it out if u still need. It looks like this gahaha. . 
I would love to see it …….
Hell yeah
I have all of the faraway ones from the recent restock and I love them but I really do wish I could have one of the older ones mine look so balls 💔💔
Hatred, rage, anger
I feel so unsigma! - sunny plush
I wasn't able to buy any from the original run, so I wouldn't know what the problems with the new batch are. It's nice that you bought one for your friend, though!
How stiff are these plushies? Can you sit them down somewhere and have them stay in place? I kinda want one, but I don't wanna have it just kinda lie down somewhere. I'd like to be able to set it upright somewhere in my apartment as a cute little decor piece.
they are realllly stiff . Usually if you lean them against a wall or use a plushie stand they will stay upright
there isn’t really a way to have them stand on their own though . And they definetly can’t sit…..
Ah, that's good to know. Thanks!
THEY LOOK THE SAME??
there’s small differences to me that culminate….. . . . I say ugly in a loving way though
No matter what issue, snuuy plushie = cute. . . We need him spinning like the omori plush spin video
snuuy
no
I’ve warmed up to him a bit since initially getting him . I don’t think he looks Horrendous  but I do think he looks worse than the first stock
Awh, she actually looks sort of cute.. . I believe someone had a Sunny with the same issue when they first made the Faraway plushies… It must run in the family!
👉🏻🌱
I wish I could take my Sunny to the park. He only explores my room. Isabelle used to be with him but she was given away as a gift so now he’s alone.. . 
Oh noooo :( I hope he gets a new plush friend soon to be friends with.
Sunny searching who asked
Super cute!
He touched grass!
Me in the last three days frfrfr
Omori is Sunny’s super cool, edgy OC after all.
Kirimori. . 

I was kicking and giggling my feet when i read it it’s peak
Perfectheart fight spanning a full volume when
Can’t wait to see the group gorge themselves on whole chickens every time they get hit with her attacks.
a hell nah even omori is aura farming atp 
Omori is basically what Sunny sees/saw himself as. He’s a shut in, his ego has to be ABSOLUTELY massive to keep himself afloat.
Yeah I don’t think a lot of people realize just *how* much of a little shit he is, and HS perfectly shows us that. Foe facts is obvious with how he clowns on every enemy there, even his friends.. . 
There’s also his little smirk he does during the team attack. He is such a little brat. . 
FUCK YEAH THIS IS WHAT BEING ALONE AND DEALING WITH GRIEF DOES TO SOMEONE 🔥🔥🔥
given the fact Omori is also his self insert edgy OC who cannot die and in theory could insta win every single fight (but does not purely to make Sunny believe there’s any stakes in a fight to make Omori even cooler when he wins), yeah Sunny’s ego is absolutely massive. not to mention the fact everyone of his friends basically fawns over Omori
. . sorry i had to
>!Can't wait for the auraloss when GOATnny low diffs BUMori!<
Omori: the dreamer. (Yes I know it’s up to interpretation whether omori is the dreamer in headspace lore aka the lore sunny leaves in via the lost woods area in pyrefly forest but i believe he is)
I'm Omori (2020)
She asked how did he survived from…
Imagine Sunny giggling and kicking his feet while he's knocked out on Basil's bathroom. .  Sunny wtf?!


omori just does not care and i love it-
We see the fit Piccolo
Sunny making TikTok aura farming edits of himself in his own mind lol
New chapter? I checked and there hasn't been new one in 8 months. Maybe i'm forgetting things that already happened
We see the fit bro just sit down already 🥀
Since this is headspace, the better question is why did SUNNY imagine him like that?. .  do you have something to tell us snuuy
What do you mean by that
Stolen joke from a youtuber
anybody who posts or upvotes this kinda shit needs their hard drives examined by police
Why the hell are you getting downvoted? They are thirteen in headspace, these jokes shouldn’t be made. It’s just weird.
wait what did I miss
Im as confused as you are and i would also like to know what did i miss
Oh sorry! The person I was replying to was getting downvoted for telling people not to make or upvote sexual jokes about thirteen year olds :D
Yeah, it such a good game, I just wish that the creators (and some of the fandom) were better :(
what did they post, it's deleted
i wouldnt want to repeat it, but it insinuated sexual activity between minors
Jesus man…
What did they post
Oh
Im sorry :(
Do you see how he is imagining his sister? Bro is strange
I mean, this is the artist's fault. In the game they all fine.
Im sorry what 
I'm talking abt sunny dude
also it's OMORI, not Snuuy
They corrected you because you named the wrong character. Omori might be the personification of some of Sunny's traits but he's not Sunny 1 to 1, he's a different character. Also I'm not in love with them, I'm on their side because they can actually think. Also also I'm gonna stop responding here, this argument is too stupid to be worth my time and energy.
philosophical ass answer
thanks for info! omori is going by the name sunny from now on <3
It’s Snuuy, not Sunny
The art was when OMORI was still OMORIBOY, so either the bra is someone else's (like MARI's) or it's just a reference to the initial idea of being able to choose SUNNY's gender . . . But if you want, SUNNY can also be transfem
Sunny is omori, sunny is a teen. Sunny takes the form of omori in headspace and whitespace,>!red space and black space!<
jumping this high to reach that conclusion would land you an olympic medal
I don't know what that means
Are ppl not allowed to crossdress what
If him and Sunny don’t kiss I’m gonna flip a biscuit
If they don't kiss, i will gamble 
LETS GO GAMBLING
*loud wrong beep* ah dang it
ah dang it
Aw dang it
Aw dang it
Aw Shucks
KILL YOURSE-
CHUCKAROONIES!
is that a Limbus Company??? In my OMORI subreddit???
He is the reincarnation of Jun Kuruso with Sunny being the reincarnation of Tatsyua!
thats how Sunny likes him
Because sunny got a little distracted describing his dreamy eyes in his mind
Sunny like him looking extremely gay
Ok cmon sunny at least give the shippers a challenge
Is call rizz he’s pro trying to rizz Sunny up
I guess Sunny can't imagine her sister being angry.
Can't or WON'T?
PEOR QUE >! SUNNY CAYENDO DEL HOSPITAL!<
This isn’t my first exposure to Omori I’ve been lurking around the sub for a few months but had never played the game. I know about a lot of big moments in the game especially the reveal at the end but I am excited for the next chapter. People who have played the game said that it’s too fast paced but I think the first chapter conveyed what it was supposed to convey. Our protagonist is being haunted by the guilt of his sister’s death 3-4 years ago and he was part of a friend group that fell apart because of her. Also Sunny is a little autistic, being able to live in a world he created in his mind with the ideal versions of his friends. I think something that could have been conveyed a little better was the fact that Sunny was a shut-in for so long but that’s just me.
Is it just me who kinda... didn't like it? The art is gorgeous and some of the panelling is really cool but if it's trying to tell the story of omori to a new unfamiliar audience it's very strange to begin with faraway town and to drop that Mari is dead before we even know anything about her, as well as having no knowledge about sunny or kel or basil or anyone for that matter. Mari's death isn't even outright stated until Aubrey talks to kel and sunny in the church later on in the game, which is a very impactful moment in how blunt it is, and Aubrey coming out and shouting it in the middle of a park after saying she was never even friends with Sunny (which isn't in the game, correct me if I'm wrong but she just kinda acts apathetic towards sunny in that first meeting in the park) seems very out of character, as well as going back into white space after Aubrey is stabbed doesn't adhere to the rules of sunny's retreat into head space established in game. Obviously it's interesting if it's meant for fans of the game with knowledge of the story, but still seems vastly inferior due to the character actions I mentioned. Is it just me?
Agreed, this definitely felt more like it was made for those already familiar with the story. I guess they wanted to flip the script by introducing the Faraway versions of the characters first and then hitting you with Sunny's idealized dream versions, but it happened a bit too quickly imo. The headspace sections seem kinda tricky to adapt so it'll be interesting to see how it goes.
I agree that Sunny showing too much emotion isn't great, and causes some issues with the characterization of some other characters too. >!Especially towards the end of the RW section, I think it mischaracterizes Aubrey a bit when she's still berating Sunny while he's freaking the fuck out. I personally always took it as Aubrey lashing out at him because he always looked like he didn't care. She's a good-hearted person so I think she'd have probably laid off if he was visibly distressed by the things she was saying. She just kind of looks like an ass here.!<
I would've loved seeing slightly differing artstyles between Headspace and Faraway, but maybe that's hard to pull off without being too jarring. I still really liked some of the wider panels especially, but this is very subjective ofc.
This is admittedly an artstyle complaint but I feel like all the characters look samey? Body type wise.. . They're all drawn with think wirey frames which makes them all look less distinct to me. Kel's athlecism and Sunny's state of malnourishment isn't communicated at all.
And why couldn’t they have made every real world panel full color? It looks so much better, and don’t they know Sunny isn’t black and white? Smh my head
shake my head my head?
lol out loud
Lmao my ass off
sunny you fucked up bro how is a single mother who can barely make enough money pay all that
Right? Like she’s fucking cooked
she will go to the hospital and see the bill and be like "yeah maybe your father was right"
“And I thought the funeral was expensive enough. Fuck you think Groupon can help me out here?”
won't they tecnically make Basil's parents pay since he was kinda the reason for Sunny's injuries (those fuckers deserve to spend their money for leaving their son go through so much psychological pain)
Sell the piano, those things regularly go for upwards of $10k and nobody's playing it anymore anyways
You also know that they will eventually become good friends again. If you had played the game , until sunny Reveal the truth I don't know after that lol.
Plot twist: Sunny snaps her neck.
Honestly, as a Sunburn enjoyer myself, I feel like they did us a disservice more than anything.. . Yes, Sunny’s crush towards her is more evident, and these panels are really cute on their own, but imo, they did Aubrey so dirty here.. . A thing I liked about their relationship in-game, was witnessing how Aubrey tends to be generally softer in his regard than she is towards Basil or Kel. She never goes directly after him, and the only times when she insults him are when they have their first reunion in faraway’s park (and even there, she immediately cuts the act once Kel points out how rude she’s being), and when she calls him a “psychopath who carries a knife” (which is optional and only happens if Sunny has actively stabbed her with said knife). . . To me, this reflects her more tender side pretty well, together with showing how much she still cares about Sunny’s wellbeing deep down.. . In the manga, however, she’s unnecessarily cruel towards him without much reason: she constantly calls him a “loser shut-in” (a thing she never does in-game) and is even more eager to use physically violence against him.. . I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish with this characterisation. Perhaps they thought it would make her look “cooler”, but to me, it only erases the complexity and good of her character.. . Anyone else feels this way?
I agree wholeheartedly. I feel like the excessive cruelty and belittling of Sunny was a unnecessary addition. I do agree that Aubrey was done pretty damn dirty. (But also, the cute panels were nice)
Might change as time goes on. We'll have to see how she acts in Day 2 which hopefully they do incorporate her being softer towards sunny, especially by Day 3 where she tends to glance at him a lot more due to his physical state.
oh sup sunny
Cuz sunny likes it
Cause Sunny is a bicon
snuuy bacon!?
I mean Sunny is also dreaming of himself as a 12 year old
Sunny: WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU, BASIL???. . Basil: I CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE WITHOUT YELLING, SUNNY!!!

“mom, something did a thing again!”
Imo headspace does take up a lot of time, but if you skip too much of it you loose the feel that sunny likes to spend time in headspace cause its safe there.. . It doesn’t look like they’ve added any new scenes to make up for the cut content so…yikes
Honestly that's not what bothers me, what bothers me is the "headspace" sections are happening too EARLY. . We're still on day one and unless Sunny wakes up in his bed during the next day, it'll be too early
Polly looks about the same height as Sunny in the first panel
Somehow sunny looks smaller as a 16 years old than as a 12 years old
Me getting goosebumps thinking of the Omori / Sunny fight. I am going insane. I am O B S E S S E D with the artwork
so then who is the ace detective?. fuckin Sunny? . . . like what?
no idea 👍. . sunny prob fits futaba or kasumi more tho
Hear me out... How is she suppose to summon her Persona? I figured out that Sunny and Omori would probably stab themself, but her? She just buy a 1€ mask from Hobbeez and she is done..? How is she suppose to do that? Is she stupid?
TEEN Sunny can show emotions???
I think it’s interesting to note that >!He sorta does look like Sunny in the last panel. The “calm down.” His expression. Could be foreshadowing to that fight.!<
I mean he literally has the collar/sleeve
"calm down, Omori!!!" Omori: na-ah!! Calm down is Sunny's skill , not mine! I just stab instead!!! 😈😈😈. . 
or what if sunny's handwriting is the font used for the omori textbox
How does Sunny have better hand writing than me, he doesn’t even leave his house :(
The little you know who this is from sunny makes me smile
adding onto this, it’s also really clever bc of the fact that in game they let you name your protagonist anything and how “you know who” fits regardless of what you name your protagonist
It's not good as a re-imagining of the story for the old fans, and it's probably just a horribly rushed and confusing mess for new folks. A side story, one of the earlier loops Sunny has gone through pre-game, a vague and mysterious epilogue, anything would probably be better than this. It's just. Shallow. Rushed. Lacking heart.
i completely agree.It would be so cool if we could see atleast some pictures of omori and his loops in whitespace
i think I’m the only one who actually enjoys it, i love the transition of sunny fainting into headspace, and I feel like its given him more emotion. I think the pacing is actually somewhat fitting, they fit in the flowers and reasoning for each character being said flower. I love the fight scenes even if they’re short lived, they still have shown the intensity and difference it makes when sunny/omori uses a knife instead of a bat, ball, plush, or pan. Overall I think it just handles it pretty well as an avid omori lover  I guess my one complaint is there hasnt been a ton of scenery but I assume that’ll change in later chapters (hopefully )
It's amazing . . I like Sunny with Emotions. . He's cute
Only thing I'm asking myself is how they'll do with Acrophobia. Since Sunny doesn't awake at his house and since during that evening he'll tecnically face Aracnophobia... I'm just asking where they'll put him.. . . Still great tho. Rearranging some events to male the story both new for old fans and appealing for new ones, while at the same time being faithful to the original product.. . . First chapter was good but a little weird, this one is just a banger. Hope 3rd chapter will spice things up
Just look at Sunny. I know he is pretty small naturally but even his face makes him look like he's still a child.
I- don't have any pictures to look at right now
. . I don't know if this is a good example but here you go
Skip the first chapter if you don't want to see Sunny being drew weird af.
:SUNNY.... . Why is everything dirty?. . **WHY YOU DIDN'T CLEAN?**. . # DID YOU REALLY THINK MY DEATH WOULD STOP ME OF MAKING THE HOUSE CLEAN?!. . . . # CLEAN ALL THE HOUSE IN THIS INSTANT N.O.W!. . : SIS YES SIS
She still loves you, Sunny.
One of my favorite parts in the final duet is where it shows a far off scene of abuery and Sunny sitting on the swings together. Not even swinging, just, sitting next to eachother, weather they’re silent or talking. That was an important enough moment in Sunny’s head to flashback to it when he was near death, just her and him together.. . He has moments in final duet with all his friends together, or just him and Mari (because grief obviously) but there’s no solo moment with just him and basil, just him and kel, or just him and hero. The only moment he’s along with someone other then his sister is with Aubrey. It’s seen from a distance, he clearly cares about this moment they had together but maybe that feels a bit out of reach now. It was a real gut punch my first time watching ngl made me cry even harder
The only reason he's not expressive in game is because we barely see him up close. . . The flies annoy him, he's surprised during the group hug, he hesitates to jump into the lake. . . Besides a manga where sunny isnt expressive would be boring since ue doesnt speak. . . One of Sunny's memories as he is close to death during memory lane is the rain scene where he realizes he has a crush on Aubrey. This is the only scene without Mari, and this is all after Sunny has seen how Aubrey has changed. Plus, Sunny's whole thing is not letting things go, assuming it's unlikely he doesn't have a crush is absurd.
Is this in Sunny's headspace? Like, is this what he thought it would've been like?
Yes this is his headspace eh
I love how disproportinately massive sunny's head is compared to the others'. . I guess that's why they call him "bulbous"
Erm ackshually sunny doesn't talk at all 🤓
"PIZZA DELIVERY" - Sunny Suzuki
I would've said that but it wouldn't sound as good with my sentence 😭
lol
Sunny is just so.. perfect… ig .. ><
"It's pride month sunny, you know what that means."
What do you mean. . Do you like. . Want me to swap Headspace’s color palette to rainbow because it already is. . What
. . this
YES
The only emotions Sunny shows in the manga is surprise, worry, fear and neutral. What are people yapping about? Wasn’t Omori the “emotionless” one?
Yes, omori is the emotionless one. And still, during fights, he feels emotions.
not to mention he feels stronger emotions than the other three
EXACTLY!
. . Sunny when a fly mildly annoys him:
OMORI fans when you ask them to actually play the game:
I never played it. . 
I would highly recommend you do, it's great .
Kay I will maybe get it 
It's on sale too rn. . 
OMORI fans when they find out Sunny isn't just like OMORI:
WHAT NO THAT CAN'T BE
When they realize Sunny actually has facial expressions in the game:
I mean a whole part of his personality that is very emphasized is that he feels things very extremely. I mean think about the emotions mechanic!
(Warning for spoilers ig). . This has kinda been my theory.. . The game is told from Sunny’s perspective (obv), But maybe he *feels* like in these situations he is looking/feeling stoic, but in reality from an outer perspective he is more expressive than we get to see? . . Maybe he is neglecting to see his own emotions until he is actually confronted with him? (The ‘something’ battles for example). . Like in the bathroom, Basil says Sunny looks scared, but in the mirror Sunny is still expressionless looking… maybe that’s just how *he* sees himself?. . Plus in the photo album, If I remember correctly, there are plenty of times where he is expressing emotions, so I don’t think it’s been an *always* thing where he’s stoic constantly.
They complaining about the sunny sandwich when omocat only gave the ingredients (I’m smart trust)
Nobody's trying to say Sunny is a soulless monster, simply that he doesn't often show emotions on his face often.. . There's few instances we *know* Sunny is showing his emotions on his face in the game are when he's angry against the flies and when he's scared against Something and scared/stressed out against Basil.. . One relatively funny situation (that still speaks something about his character: Sunny gets angry easily when something irritates him) and then 4 high tension ones. People aren't complaining cus he's showing emotions, but cus he's doing it when story wise it doesn't make sense. . In his fight against Aubrey (in-game) he still thinks he's dreaming, and then tension is added to the scene when he cuts her and it's pointed out to the player that cutting people does in fact hurt them. . Meanwhile in the manga, the tension of the scene rises earlier because (at least some people have thought this) it looks like they made Omori "control" Sunny to attack her which just isn't how it goes. . I feel like I had something else to say but I forgot
when did omori ever control him out of headspace, he only like partially controls him in headspace 💀
When he brings out the knife to slash her, Omori appears in the reflection of the blade. . Combine that with the "No... NO...!" in the side panels and it looks like Sunny is doing it against his will
is it really omori? I think it’s just sunny tbh because THE ENTIRE THING IS BLACK AND WHITE.
The face is Sunny's but it's the only time we see him with Omori's dead eyed stare
omori has emotions and they both have the dead eyes stare in their neutral icons
Frfr
Yup Sunny is just depressed, and kinda shy(?).. A soulless monster doesn't get angered by the local bee.
Lord forbid a kid have emotions
REAL people need to realise literally the creator of the game made this ??? this is literally how the characters are supposed to be ???? like i wasn’t expecting it either but that’s just how i perceive it yk
He omor
. . Mfw the drawn more detailed character has more expression than the pixel art character from an isometric top down view.
i read "sunny is too expensive" and was confused for a bit
OMORI is too expensive.
eh, think i bought it at full price and it was pretty cheap. . beauty of indie games
I was talking about OMORI not OMORI idiot
OH MY FUCKING GOD THE PPL WERE COMPLAINING BECAUSE IT WAS TOO EXAGGERATED THE REASON WHY HIS STOIC IN THE EARLY PARTS OF THE STORY CAUSE HIS  DETACHED IN REALITY AND IT DESTROYS HIS CHARACTER FUCKING DEVELOPMENT IN THE LATER PART OF STORY AS HE FUCKING TRY TO DISCOVERED THAT HIDING AND REPRESSING HIS EMOTION'S AND EXPRESSING IS NOT HEALTHY FOR HIM AND HEE NEEDED TO OPEN UP MORE . . U GUYS ALWAYS FUCKING ALWAYS CLAIM YOU KNOW SUNNY AS THE CHARACTER AND GETTING ANGRY AT PPL CRITICIZING THE MANGA CHARACTERIZATION WHILE COMPLETELY FUCKING MISSING THE FACT THAT'S HIS ENTIRE POINT OF CHARACTER IN THE STORY
Exactly what I said in other posts. I enjoyed his emotionally unexpresssive side as it made him stand out in the group. . . It was always quite eerie to see him not express any emotion at the basil bathroom scene, or any of the mirror scenes and it can be a realistic trauma response for Sunny knowing what he went trough as many people going trough traumatic experiences do report having trouble expressing emotions. . . Which makes the crying scene in the hospital bed so much better as it signifies him beggining to process his trauma. . . Yet the manga took that away, it just made Sunny feel like another more quiet version of Basil.
Also, if I may add one more thing. I think people here misunderstand what the difference between being emotionless and being emotionally unexpresssive is. . . We never called Sunny an emotionless monster, we just simply brought attention to the fact that he has trouble showing emotions on the outside, which is much more different than calling him emotionless. . . Being emotionally unexpresssive entails that you can still feel emotions, but you cannot express them on the outside via facial expressions or tone of voice.
A lot of his and OMORI's emotions still feel overly exaggerated. Part of his arc was to experience more complex emotions than just Being Happy, Being Sad and Being Angry - to pull himself out of a state of perceiving those as just stats in a game. The manga can't seem to decide if it has gameplay elements or not, so that makes it a bit of a challenge. Sunny should be allowed to be expressive, but at least in subtler ways...
In my opinion,he should Start Pretry Emotionless on the Outside and Slowly show more Emotion as the Chapters go on,i mean,its Character Development 101
Wrote a whole essay about why he thinks sunny being expressive is a bad thing and that it's out of character
how lmao
you know what's fucked up? . .   . in a way, you could say that by delving into Headspace and trying to create a world of delusions to replace reality, Sunny was in fact making (up) new memories of them being together. he followed the assignment to the letter, and in Hikki route he passed it with flying colors.
The way I read it at least was that it was supposed to be overwhelming. I think it was meant to be seen as if from Sunny's pov, and let the reader feel the same way that he felt. In an rpg, this viewpoint is inherently difficult to portray, and the game didn't really attempt it anyway, so it was fun for me to see Sunny's overstimulation after 4 years of staying at home portrayed. I also don't mind >!Mari's death being shown immediately. If it's from Sunny's pov, this shouldn't be a plottwist anyway. Leave the details out, hint at something sinister, but the fact that she's dead should be clear!<. Also, assuming headspace gets a much calmer pacing (which it should), it's nice way to parallel the game. Like the idea of "I like it here, this is much nicer."
like i said, i don’t mind the rearrangement of the events. the christmas scene being shown as a nightmare instead was intresting imo, my problem is with faraway town. I don’t think it was done intentionally. if it was meant to be overwhelming it should’ve been shown in the artwork and staging. it just comes off as lazy.
I thought it was implied that >!Sunny forgot Mari died, though.!<
>! He surely never forgot it. Else why would the something haunt him, or would Mari jumpscare you on the first night. Sunny locked away the parts of his memory where he actually killed her, which is understandable. That's why the manga probably won't tackle that part until the end as well. !<
Yeah, I'm guessing he locked away the reason why something exists in the first place, but couldn't lock away the something itself
>!I interpreted the hallucinations as Sunny having guilt, but not knowing what it was for. Sunny has the option of opening the door to hallucination Mari when she says she's returning, and I don't think he would've if he consciously remembered. plus, the whole point of headspace + black space was to escape from the horrible events that happened in the rw, and Sunny knowing that she's dead undermines the safety/comfort that headspace gives him.!<
>!Like, literally every morning waking up would be a reminder that Mari died. Sorry but you don't just forget you had a sister. He obviously remembers her, otherwise why would she show up in headspace and explicitly refer to him as her "little brother?"!<. . >!The "running away from trauma" part is him running away from the fact he killed her. Not that she died at all. Everyone knows she died. Hell, the player knows she died by the time basil disappears. The "comfort" comes from creating a world where everyone is still a kid in the Good Ol' Days and Mari is still alive and kicking. That's the comfort. Why would it undermine it if Sunny knew she was dead?!<. . Edit: >!btw, black space is not a place to run away to from his trauma. Black space is the part of his mind where the trauma is stashed away. It's the exact opposite of a comfort hideaway. The entire point of headspace is to create a place where Black Space would threaten Sunny's mind. However the trauma is so colossal that stashing it away is literally not an option. That's the entire point of the game.!<
Bro did you read anything I've written in this entire thread. It's not a core plot point. It's a plot point that Sunny is running away from Mari's death. It's a plot point that he's consumed by guilt. It's a plot point that sunny retreats to white space at the mere mention of Mari. If you think that Sunny magically forgot his sister *literally dying* then I'm sorry but you just misinterpreted the game. . . The church scene is relevant because it's the first time in years he's confronted with his sister's death. It's not news to him, but being confronted by something you're running away from is a huge deal. The reason why things change from there on is not because he's magically "remembered" that Mari's dead, it's because he can't run away anymore. . . Like I don't see how you don't get this. How in the world do you think someone with 12 years worth of daily memories to his sister can forget that she's dead. He's not in headspace 24/7, as even in the hikkikokori route you go through an entire day doing your chores. Every waking second is a reminder she's not there. Kel has been knocking for months to get Sunny to come out. Each knock is another reminder of their lost friendgroup, and subsequently of Mari's presence. He chooses to ignore it and to run away from it, but you best your damndest that he knows. . . All sunny does is choose to forget one (1) moment of his life. A huge one, sure, but still a moment. To forget that his sister is dead would be to choose to forget every waking second ever since that day, including each second in the actual present. Are you not sensing how absurd that is to even consider.
He didn't forget her death. He forgot he was the one who did it. He had a moment of disassociation after Mari died from being in shock. That was when he and basil did what they did, and Something was born from Basil and Sunny's imaginations. Something is portrayed as being the true killer/cause of Mari's death initially but it's actually Sunny which is why Something follows Sunny in hs
Yeah, but if you look at Something in the mirror, it looks shorter than Sunny does because it’s floating off the ground.
I assumed that Something was slightly smaller than Sunny (probably about 5 foot at most) but this makes Something look about 8 feet tall. Wow lmfao. . EDIT: Changed what person I wrote this in because apparently I’m the only one who thinks Something in the game is shorter than Sunny is. My assumption comes from the mirror jump scare since it seems like it’s floating above the ground.
I think it wouldn’t be insane to assume Something can just change it’s shape/how tall it is. To feel overbearing to Sunny.
That actually makes sense. Its phobia forms are proof that it can change shape or size.
I always thought it was pretty tall
We did?? I always thought SOMETHING was like really tall XD
Damn, this really puts us in Sunny’s perspective. Imagine seeing that in the middle of the night lol.
If you compare the sprites, something was always towering over sunny in height, it just always appears in mirror a lot smaller for some reason
Tbf, I think that's intentional by the artist. I don't think Sunny's eaten very well since the incident.
I wasn't really that surprised, honestly. the Something sprite towers over Sunny, and even so, Sunny is easily the smallest member of the group. (I personally headcanon him to be 5'7). >!Plus Something is based off Mari's dead carcass, which was a significant height off the ground. Sunny might've distorted it so that Something was Mari's height including the distance from the ground.!<
"The guiltiest hikikomori in history vs the guiltiest hikikomori of today". . Sunny:"If Basil had garden shears he might give me a little trouble.". . Kel: "But would you lose?". . Sunny: "Nah I'd win.". . Basil: " You were magnificent Sunny. I shall never forget you for as long as I live."

I guess everyone else at the playground witnessed it too... Oh well, I think this would work better if it had OMORIBOY vibes and it was basically always one main protagonist (SUNNY, whom was always called OMORI since the game's development?) without an alter ego.
Never realized how short Sunny is lmao 😭. . IK hes supposed to be malnourished and thats probably why, but homie looks like a 5 year old
you think a growing boy can grow without proper nutrition for 4 YEARS?
Fiar enough lol, I was just tricked by these images to think he's pretty much as tall as the others haha. Could it be dream world shenanigans with him imagining the gang as younger and shorter maybe?. . 
HS friend group is made from the memories before the incident. Kell grew a lot taller after it while sunny was shut in
Before the incident, Kel was the shortest one of the group, while Sunny was the tallest among the younger 4
Well I mean, they are children. I don't follow up on any controversy here but making them kid-like makes sense for the setting. Obviously it's weird as fuck if it's for any other reason
i mean it makes sense for headspace but they’re all getting close to adulthood in faraway, i’d expect them to be taller. prob just artistic choice though
Are they? Wait how old are the official ages in faraway? I always assumed they're like 14 in the real world, and about 10 in headspace. Hero being about 17 in HS, and 21 in Faraway. 14 makes sense for all their designs, kel and Aubrey look about that age, and Sunny is malnourished so he's smaller.. . Tbh all their ages look pretty accurate for early teens. Basil is pretty much the only one who looks a bit too young and has no real reason, but that could just be cause he likes dressing in a softer way that makes him look young
Might just depend on what culture youre from, but in my experience 16 year olds do not look like adults quite yet. Aubrey is a pretty accurate depiction of a 16 year old girl and kinda looks like some of my friends through high school. Kel is also pretty accurate. He has a baby face but otherwise he looks like a teen. Sunny again has an excuse, hes malnurished so he looks tiny. Sunnys clothes also make him look like a stereotypical school boy, which makes him look younger. Basil is the only one who truly looks like a kid in my opinion, but I think a lot of that comes from him wearing flower crowns and having a less mature personality. . .   . Could also be that we see them chibi-fied in the game a lot. Like they need to fit in tiny sprites, which means theyll have ambigous ages in game. They also have the small bubbles for expressions, which means their faces need to be exaggerated slightly. This means the designs need bigger eyes for expressions, and thats something we identify with kids.
It's not that Sunny's short, it's that Kel's so damn tall
It is her pushing her anger onto others, but yeah, while I’m okay with Omori’s story, it does irk me nearly none of them actually sit down and ask Sunny if he’s okay. I can get if they think it’s a taboo subject, but they started discussing her death and how it made them feel at Sunny’s house, that would have been the perfect time. Actually, Hero pissed me off by saying “Everything feels so different now... but it seems like you've pretty much stayed the same. It's kind of relieving, to be honest! Haha!” I know he means it’s comforting, but this isn’t your buddy in his 20’s that’s the same 5 years later, Sunny hasn’t really changed AT ALL since he was 12! I’m hoping the Manga fixes some of this either Hero and Aubrey, as they already started with Kel. Hell I’m already interested in how scenes will be handled given it seems Sunny is aware of the truth, perfect scene is the lake, since for all intents and purposes and purposes, Aubrey pushing Basil into the lake is akin to Sunny pushing Mari down the stairs, and I’m interested in his reaction.
I really hope the manga does have Sunny do more. When playing him he feels like a vessel with no emotions around people unless alone or pushed. I’d really like to see him being pushed to share feelings by others (ik the main bit of the story is him pushing out Basil for trying to say the truth to him as Omori and his friends as Sunny might be afraid of pushing him away in these last couple of days). Also tbf it doesn’t seem like anyone pushed him to get help in 4 years either…
I’m in the middle on that, I don’t want him speaking, but his body language and facial reactions are enough, as well as his hallucinations. Either way, I get you didn’t know the truth, but have the kid back away at the lake scene at least, that’s all I wanted…
While I agree the scene itself was illustrated really well, I still think that >!Sunny stabbing Aubrey!< happening before the entire headspace section makes it lose a lot of impact. It’s when Sunny realizes that “Oh, no, this isn’t my Headspace RPG, this is real life, I can’t just do that” and it just doesn’t work as well for me if we don’t experience Headspace first. Plus, the relationship between Sunny and Aubrey needs to be established. The manga just mentions they used to be friends while the game shows the group’s dynamic before revealing how it ended up in real life. It makes the >!stabbing!< hurt that much more because we know firsthand how they used to be.
I think sunny was just on autopilot
Sunny was locked in
correction snuyy was locked in
He used his domain expansion.
I think Sunny is just small, he’s a malnourished 16-year-old, I know non-malnourished kids older than him being like, 5’2ft.
it is canon that Sunny is short as hell so
I think its just Sunny thats short as hell
I'm pretty sure the next panel shows Sunny's height being up about until Kel's chin, the perspective is just weird in this panel
Sunny is short but I think the artstyle just makes everyone other than Kel look short too, I was expecting Sunny and Basil to be almost the same size but was kinda surprised that it seems Aubrey is around the same height too. . . . Edit: after looking at official art it seems that Aubrey is indeed kinda short, if anything Basil is the one that should be a bit taller, maybe it's just the proportions that are bothering me? I feel that in the game there's a very clear distinction between the ages of the group in white space and the ones in the real world, but I get the impression that it isn't that noticeable in the manga
Sunny looks like a toddler here
yeah in the first few panels sunny is literally a little kid vs kel even though it's a foot difference
Lmao why is Sunny standing like that.
Sunny has midget status.
sunny... so pretty ///////
Stop showing sunny >w< i’m simping so much omg 🎀😸🥹
Sunny broke his mewing streak 😞
We can’t see Omori’s expression and reactions in-game, nor Sunny’s. I mean, both react to stuff in some way, f.e. stepping back, jumping
Yes, and I think it's so good that the manga artist draws such unique expressions for Sunny and Omori.
Takopi's original sin reminds me of omori , I even drew this (Sunny's original sin) 
Yes, they are similar. They can both be described as "a bunch of kids spending the summer together" lol.
A bunch of mentally ill kids spending the summer together
Come to think of it, a Silent Voice isn't that far off from Omori either.
Well... Let me explain it like an Ai.... . 1•Some events or the order of events are different and the story progresses way faster than it does in the game.. . 2•People complain about the manga:. -"everyone looks like kids in this art style". -"characters are out of character". . 3•in my opinion: the manga had a cute and cool art style, quite fitting .. . 4•the change of script made the manga turn into a new experience.. . 5•characters' expressions were unique, expressing so many unique emotions.. . 6•Sunny and Omori didn't have flat face the whole time and could actually show concern and fear, which is quite accurate, because:. -Sunny actually shows fear through cutscenes and Something battles.. -Omori is controlled by Sunny throughout the game, so Sunny and Omori's expressions and personality will cross even if Omori himself can't have the AFRAID emotion on him.
She just got hit by sunny cursed technique   . (Outstanding work btw)
Y'know the blood was reminding me of a black flash.... . . . Ty btw!
This looks like a jjk spoiler hmm..
i'm so glad someone else noticed this, i've been saying since the release that Sunny used his dismantle technique on Aubrey
sunny turned into the autism creature on the last image 😭
EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT
Yeah, I love how the manga doesn't villainize Omori. Omori genuinely cares about Sunny, and he's just doing whatever he thinks is best for him which to him means repressing the truth regardless of the cost. I'd put him in the same category as >!Monika!< (DDLC), >!Pale King!< (Hollow Knight) and >!Ceroba!< (Undertale Yellow); they know they're doing something that isn't right but they know it's for another, more important motive that they believe is worth the cost. After all, Stranger also said that Omori *saved* Sunny in the past. I genuinely think that if Omori is still around after the good ending, he is 100% redeemable. Omori is just a goober trying his best.
The expression work has been some of my favourite parts of the manga. It humanises both Omori and Sunny so much without forcing them to speak, and I've always been of the opinion that Omori is merely a reluctant guardian who'll do what it takes to carry out his god-given task of protecting Sunny. Give me that redemption arc! (genuinely writing one as we speak)
That's a little unsubtle, eh SUNNY? Or should I call you OMORI?
I do feel like having a Knife involved with Sunny's "suicide" is a neat concept to parallel how Sunny used it in canon Omori.
I'm sure they knew what they were doing when they drew Sunny with sock garters
This minor drawing mistake will now lead to 500,000 jortrilllion AI accusations
I was looking for Goku 😭😭
There is no Goku in Ba Sing Se.. . 
. . Not for long

but there is
Didn't know Sunny was J. Geil's cousin
Don’t tell polnareff
Well Sunny does have a thing for >!killing sisters!<

I do??? 

red circle spotted, where's goku at

Nah i changed my mind, Nui unzestified Hero, but Sunny's hand were the price.
Similar fact about the omori trailer: at one point, it shows Omori walking, but every step his left foot steps forward, and the other foot becomes the left foot.
Tbf, his name is Sunny. Not Thumby.
I think he is checking the pressure or the blood, because if sunny had hit his head, he could've Tell.
i think everybody knows that, im just referring to the drawing mistake here
Ah, i thought it was because they are holding hands or some shit like that. After all the shit that i saw on this subreddit, I doubt nothing.
is this not his thumb?. . 

The fucking Reg explaining shit is so peak
Even sunny is shocked at the fact when it hit him after the peak ecplaining, just look at the face doll!
so this is what you are telling me?. . 
... I meant Sunny's hand
ok i think i see what you mean
Nobody's talking about how it looks like hero snapped sunnys arm 😂
Reverse J.Geil
sunny lowk serving with those nails
Other than the drawing mistake it also looks like hero is about to rip Sunny’s arm off for lunch with the way he’s holding it
They look perfectly normal?
Yeah! Perfectly normal for a LEFT HAND
The first is a left one and second is a right. My two cents is that Nui forgor which hand was supposed to be drawn
In this panel, she looks like the kind of person to steal Sunny's liver while he was sleaping and hold Sunny's liver hostage the next day.
it doesn’t matter if sunnys forgiven or not and imo would ruin the ending
Kinda makes sense in my mind as sunny in under nutritioned.
✿Peace be upon you ~ truly a work of art. I like to imagine the tiny man in the giant’s hand is Sunny. :)) god I love this community so much.
sunny tem 16
I don't think Sunny is small, Kel plays basketball so he could be around 1'75. Sunny could be around 1'65, in fact he is taller than Aubrey
Gotta love tiny Sunny, really tickles my brain worms for some reason.
It's a real blessing to see Sunny again, even if it's just for a moment 😞
DAMN sunny just pulled a sukuna slash
. . Totally not stolen meme

Nah I'd lose*
>shuts himself in for 4 years. . >suddenly goes out one day. . >immediately attacks the first woman he sees. . >a mimir in the park. . Sunny is so real for that tho

Don't need to pick up steak knife again, hehe.. . 
I want to see a version of this with steak knives instead of chainsaws
Less effective, need to stab rather than just let ‘em swing
But he chould throw said knifes and have a range advantage
True, stab shoot gooooo
Also his hands would be able to move much more freely.. Have you tried swinging a small knife compared to big ahh sword? You can use the small knife with more movement.
That’s basically Katana Man lmao
He also no longer needs the stairs 😭
>!Sunny, don’t open that door!<
I gently open the door-
>!(picks up violin, can't hear recital over chainsaw sounds)!<
More like violince
*Sunny now terrifies her*. . 
>!First the knife, now this.!<
chainsunny . . (also awesome cosplay!)
Fear me!. . 
 ... you're approaching me? I have chainsaws for hands, and you're approaching me?. .  I can't beat the shit out of you without getting closer. .  (Watching with popcorn)

Bro really just posted some pictures of Sunny and thought we wouldn't notice
LOLL 😭😭
sunny approved(in my opinion)
thank you!
uugh man, seeing 200 hundred comments and sorting controversial makes me feel sick
and the worst ones aren't even here because they got deleted 😭
ITS SO CUTE :3
thank u!!
You forgot a few things but good start!
yeaa definitely still in the works but i just wanted to put it on 🥹
Well congrats on the first step!
The hair isn’t on point but I don’t blame you for not wanting to mess up that spectacular cut.
what?

Kidding about suicide is so funny, yeah. Grow up.
Can't do that, I'm still 16. I belong on r/teenagers
Having that belief is very immature. Just because you're sixteen, doesn't mean you can't mature.
😕
probably the most hurtful thing i've seen on this thread 
Cool but damn, smile.
kind of out of character, don't you think?
Sunny ? Smiling ? Are you okay ?
Bro do you dislike my smile?
No of course I love Sunny's smile !
bro shut up
What's he say? Comment's been removed
honestly i can't remember but it was something racist about me 😭

Netflix Sunny
ight bruh
These are the "stop making everything about race" folks :)
I was going make a joke but I did not succumb to the intrusive thoughts
What type of jokes ?🤨
...okay?
Are you cosplaying Omori?
I was looking for a commemt like this, I am not glad to report I'm not surprised.
honestly i knew stuff like this would happen but it's whatever im honestly used to it 😭😭
What. 
Of course it’s a Florida man

well, you failed
At least, I tried(not really)
I could make a very easy joke right about now.. . Anyway cool cosplay.
kinda takes away from your compliment when you say it after that but thanks i guess
post urself so i can see u and i'll tell u what's really funny 💀
damn u really got em huh
hhhhh bro lets be honest it doesn't fits u
lmao ur skin darker than omori's life . stop escaping from reality
idc bro go tell your whopping zero followers about it
More like.. ehm.. am i allowed to finnish this joke?

Nah you snuuy don't lie
You sir, you are Sunny
LITERALLY SUNNY IN REAL LIFE. . 
Sunny got real 💀
Sunny boutta tell me my computer has virus.
Sunny stop gaslighting me 
that's it, now i can't imagine sunny not being asian

Oh my god Sunny!!!!!!! It’s them!!!!
fym. . you are the Snuuy


I mean like. I just like to wearing his outfit and stuff. But yeah. Thank for the compliment. Appreciate it.
bro you sunny irl u aint kiddin no one
No way snuuy irl???
You look like Sunny
Seems like sunny move away from farawaytown to bangkok
YOU ARE SNUUY. 
Sunny got a stand . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . I am fully aware
real "no bitches?" vibes from sunny in the last pic
Sunny kinda looks like Pride from FMAB.
Biblically accurate sunny
omg real snuuy 


Dude that's sunny
I kinda feel like this is exactly what sunny would look like in real life 🫢

Knife is missing 
Ain't gonna stab myself 😭

&#x200B;. . 
He didn't just stab himself 

You gotta commit to the bit
If it was closer to Halloween a plastic knife would be easy to find
Well. my country doesn't celebrate Halloween. And stuff. How unfortunately  , but probably finding a toy knife. Or use the real one.
Nuh uh
Just don’t go to a roof
Well in response to the caption, he already *is* Asian sooo more Sunny real life edition 😌. . Srsly though, cool cosplay, you look great!! Omori characters are so fun to do!
Thank! And i agree. 
I see sunny yet where's the cosplay

Omori in cosplay?
Pls don't take a knife and stab a girl with pink hair

We don't keep promises 
Kid named snuuy:
This isn’t cosplay, this is sunny. You killed it!!
No! Don't kill him

this is the most accurate omori cosplay
Thank! 
Asian edition? You mean the original??
Didn't know he was Asian 
So nice! I think u did realy good
Thank you. , Currently I'm ordering the pant. And shoes. So i can show the full body version. 
So cool! I cant wait to see that!

He smiled
Srry if late but Its great :)



What I love about this cosplay is that you can literally go out in public and people won't even think you're cosplaying
Yeahhh! 
Never even played the game idk why this sub is being reccomended to me,but good cosplay 👍
Thank you! 
>! now lose the eye !<

Sunny? Is that you?
I am not him. Not even look alike lmao 
r/hardimages

Asianny

Lookin great
Thank 
snuuy with phone 
Not canon. Real 
Real Sunny
You don’t look sick and tired enough. Put makeup dark circles under eyes and stay in ur room in the dark for four years to get more paler and sad looking.
I'll try. 
Sunny cosplaying as himself (real)

Aw thank 
Kek

I'm trying to reply as fast as i can. Before i fall asleep mb. 
Ok lol

Now cosplay fighting yourself
Gotta find someone that look identical to me. 
This will be omori graphics in 2015


nice bro.. (btw where’s the knife?)
I'm afraid. To hold a knife, since i was a child i accident stab myself once. It's hurt and painful so yeah. Traumatic event and stuff, gotta find some toy knife instead 
~~Bro forgot he wasn’t in Whitespace smh~~
Real. 

U really captured his  face
I just noticed that 
Sorry. The hair style is kinda messed up. And not accurate. I'll try to fix that. 
Yeah probably.
💀

It’s like looking at a mirror. 👍

Looks really good, man!
Thank!!! 
Bro just posted a picture of sunny and expected us to not notice

your cosplay looks great!
Tysm! 
So… you got an older sister?
Yes i do. 
Wasn't Snuuy canonically Asian to begin with?
Doesn't know that. 
snuuy!!! 

Thank

Nice one! I remember when i did that too, also got nervous, but it was worth it!

You're adorable. You deserve kisses.
Aw. Thank 
Be careful around the stairs
the fact that's i need to go down the stair everytimes. 
Looks good but doesn't have the dead inside look.
my bad.
The best way to gain this is to drop kick your sis down the stairs and seal yourself off for 4+ years
sorry, i already lost one, i don't want to lost more  , so no thank.
Oof damn sorry for your loss, and if I may, ask what happened to them?
nothing much, she's just passing away infront of me, at that time i was like 12.  it was hard, but i'll have to move on and stuff, so yeah i'm fine by now 
That is not nothing. I hope you find some peace from that and move on
thank, i'll try 
Not me falling for a cosplay again...  You're amazing bro 
thank. 
Damn. 
I didn’t get it sunny dear, who are you cosplaying?

That's really good! Keep it up! <3
You look dead inside. . Perfect.

For a first time cosplay, this looks awesome.
Man you're lucky 😭 . . I barely met any omori cosplayers </3 (I went to cosplay conventions as Sunny)
Yeah they are rare to find 
This is so precious  ! And Snuuy with Bnuuy!
aww thank u sm!! 
[bnuuy]()
Sunny is taller???
"Something" always appears near sunny/omori but basil has his own kind of demon . But I'm planning on cosplaying sunny as well and do some spooky something action
You all are way to nice omg <3 . I'm going to take some pictures of my sunny cosplay in a few weeks and can't wait to show them to you!
Excellent, now get a sunny to >!stab their eye out pls!<
Sunny, you lucky dawg.
Where snuuy 
I kept missing all the sunny cosplayers :(
Nice cosplay btw
Great I'll dress as Sunny!. . . . . . 0  0
Close
Your spine 
Don’t beat here soot
Your mouth 
PLEASE NO NOT AGAIN
🔫. . (nice cosplay btw!)
>!Aubrey would not survive that initial park fight!<. . Also fun fact: >!basil was originally supposed to have a gun instead of garden sheers for his suicide attempt/fight with sunny!<
Is this fr? If so thats…..not sure how I feel about that…
I’m pretty sure, yes. I remember seeing it somewhere but I can’t remember where
...:(
It'd be funny if sunny just got shot at 4am in his friends room tho lol.
Definitely, I'd die laughing and then whine to my family about how sad the ending was
Alright, who gave Sunny the hand gun
Lmao this guy on the left tho
You forgot the steak knife  🔪
I cannot afford one.
How could you not afford a steak knife but afford a fake gun?
Mercia
America
we should turn you into a meme
The game was rigged from the start
b<---He's had enough
Amazing cosplay 
Bro thinks he's Walter. . Also, amazing cosplay! Has plenty of meme potential for sure
Nice nice nice. Definitely good meme material
Awesome cosplay!
What convention is that?
SUNGUN. 
the snnuy. . (he needs a  in his life)
Mind if you send me the photos I have? I would like to see it, I appreciate for your photoshoot by the way 

ROYAL GUARD
Dante…
Trick dodge into judgment cut end
holy shit
. . “Yeah uh, he’s just kinda sitting there”
He’s my beeg guy, goes everywhere I go
Nice
You look like her
This looks like it was a lot of fun! 
They got the meats . . And the Omori decoration too ig
Thank god that the pretty boy key chain is English, since we know what happened last time
I went there on the first day because I like tea and it was so good (I got the sunny one) Your cosplay is so cool btw!
Sadly got there a few days before the pop up got set up when I thought it was already there 
Cosplaying just to go to a store?! Well… I guess the 2-d rpg communities would be the ones. Especially omori who is known for its amazing and diverse community
Uhm did you not know about the one day pop up event? 
Friend, I don’t know about any events. not to sound too critical but I played the game, joined the community, and have been getting nonstop notifications about different ways people torture their stuff, or show me things I’m half a globe away from buying.
Hmm okay  well hope you have a better day! I had a great day and just wanted to share good vibes
By no means am I trying to crap on you for enjoying/sharing your experiences, go to town. But it does kinda get frustrating when I see people talking all the time about cool stuff they bought that I’m a continent away from seeing. no need to change for someone like me, I was just having a bad day and had to let off some steam.
Honestly, don’t care. Didn’t understand if your comment was sarcastic or not at first, but now it’s clear you were being mean to “blow off steam” . . Don’t appreciate the weird racial comment you made. I’m POC, but I guess sorry I am not “diverse” enough for you. . . Plus being rude about someone cosplaying for any reason? Who cares if I actually was just going to the store? Don’t harass people. I don’t care about your frustrations, if all you do with that is harass others
I wasn’t being sarcastic. That was like two comments before any indignation I had given, and how do you get racist from “diverse”? I haven’t been harassing you, you’ve been talking to me, asking me questions, and I’ve been answering, that’s called a fucking conversation you moron. No one has been forcing you to talk to me, reply to me, or ask me questions.
Indian sunny is not real, he cant hurt you. . . Indian sunny:. . /j

we need more indian sunny
That's actually a REALLY good cosplay idea with the Something behind you! Sunny/Omori have really basic outfits, so unless someone knows the character, it can honestly feel like you're not even cosplaying a character.. . But with the Something behind you like that, it stands out much more!
Ty Yea when I wanted to cosplay Sunny my dad was definitely confused why I just wanted to be a regular boy, so I tried doing something to stand out.. . Also originally I was gonna do a big polaroid where it says “Sunny tagged you” but carrying that would have been a big pain so I opted for a hands free prop.
Lol, just a giant picture would've been pretty clunky yeah. But this definitely worked out for the best!
Sunny if his depression continues:

Nice cosplay, now find someone costplaying as Sunny and kiss them
Heheh, I wish…But I’d probably mess it up because I’ve never even gone as far as >!holding hands!< with anyone before…And as I’m 29, and most people my age have their shit together and wouldn’t want to spend too much time with a loser like me, maybe it won’t ever happen…Maybe I am destined to be forever alone …
Aw don't say that! :(
all of a sudden im imagining a sunny scam email
Now you need two more people to cosplay as Sunny and Doughie, and then you'll have the Reverie crew
Funny there isn't police officers in sunnys Town is there now
Chris Pratt as Sunny
i've cosplayed sunny, would definitely recommend 👍
Second Image:. . 
Stand user: SUNNY SUZUKI. . Stand name: 『MY TIME』. . Strength: A. . Speed: D. . Range: C. . Stamina: A. . Development potential: B. . Ability: Slowly suppresses its own existence as well as the traumatic memories of 3 opponents. Over time, each suppressed trauma turns into a dumb “autopilot” copy of its owner and will fight them. The copies can be defeated through conventional means or by recalling the traumatic memory using introspective, psychological or investigative means. When all copies are defeated, the “truth” of the stand is revealed to the target.
This has to be copy pasted..... Right? No way someone would make this entire thing just for this
you underestimate the dedication of this fandom *severely* 

Bro just told me to touch grass in the nicest way💀💀
Ong I didn't even mean it like that
Yeah yeah im jk dw
you look so good
thank you! 😊
I hope to see more cosplays from you!
Don't get your hopes up 😅 I just noticed I almost had a complete Sunny outfit already available in my closet and thought it'd be fun to dress up...
aw okay well if you find striped shorts you can always do an omori cosplay!
I don't have striped shorts, but I do know how to use photoshop...🤔
fruity af
It's a Sunny cosplay, what would you expect 🤨
The order of the pictures is hilarious tho, like you were slaying in front of the mirror, then you had to throw up in the toilet bowl, then you went back to slaying in front of the mirror like nothing happened 😂
"When you gotta go, you gotta go!"
cool
Man the 3rd picture made me laugh, and dang you look cool
Glad you like it! Had to make sure the toilet was extra clean before I stuck my head in there 😆
Nice try, Bowen 
tbh that's probably more accurate considering I am a twin 😅
Epic!
proper knife handling too!
cute
ok but why does the rolled up sleeve tshirt sweater vest thing look so good tho lol. .   . also i hope ur toilet was very clean xD
I made sure it was spotless XD
ok good xD the cosplay is so good tho like frrrr
tysm! I'm pretty happy with how the pictures turned out! 
I have become a simp once again. . (The 3rd image tho )
Cool as fuck
NGL, looks great!. Slay!
Thank you!!! 😊
:3
:]
( Well at least I can justify that it's "Sunny IRL" and not me )
wait I thought it was a meme 
( No, it pretty much is, I only did this because I thought of it and found it funny. But it is just me cosplaying, lmao )
Omori but Sunny spent all his time awake in his home gym during the 4 years
. . Sunny the second he wakes up from stabbing himself in white space
I gotta ask what was the point of censoring yourself in the first but not the second?
I didnt like my bangs in the first one.
Thats fair 
real
Makes sense
SO CUTE !!!!!!!!  Awesome cosplay !!!
Thankyu!!
Need to be more dead inside in the second pic
I did my best
Fr you look like Sunny if he pushed Mari on purpose 😭
Asa Mitaka ?!?. . 
I love it but prepare your DMS
Eccoci🙏
I dunno what that means 🙏
I think it means "Here we are" in italian
Here we go* :3
Oh dang, sometimes i confuss "Are" with "Go" for some reason. Also are you Italian?
Yessir ‼️
Sei molto Carina , all jokes aside its nice to see some italian fellas :D
Grazie mill😭😭😭
No problem 
I also don’t know what it means 🙏
Gesgundheit 
*jaw drops to floor, eyes pop out of sockets accompanied by trumpets, heart beats out of chest, awooga awooga sound effect, pulls chain on train whistle that has appeared next to head as steam blows out, slams fists on table, rattling any plates, bowls or silverware, whistles loudly, fireworks shoot from top of head, pants loudly as tongue hangs out of mouth, wipes comically large bead of sweat from forehead, clears throat, straightens tie, combs hair* Ahem, you look very lovely.

Dont bother by that a bit, cosplay is meant for fun

You did good!!!
Oh thank you!
Sunny in an alternate universe where he's happy?
Ehh pretty much but plot twist, he thai

Thank you!
I really like the attention to detail with the hair! You even got the little bangs thing that the characters have.
Thank you so much ! Yes we did it our best to look like the characters bc we love them🥰🥰🥰
Thank you so much !🥰💕
WoW ! So cool !
Sunny and Aubrey what crimes will they commit?
drug trafficking, embezzlement
Classic teenagers
I love these cosplay.

Snuuy
I hope the delivery instructions are clear.

YAYY thank you
PIZZA DELIVERY!
AYO THE PIZZA HERE

snuuy 👍
. . Here you go 
Monster...
🫶

Whoa. How did you replicate that look? Amazing!
I’m not really sure lol but thanks 
Zvvdjsndbshdh 👉👈
🫶
Cool! It looks great! 
Thanks 
That’s such a great cosplay :0
thanks!
NOOOOOO STOP MAKING ME JELOUS. I CAN PERFECTLY COSPLAY SUNNY, BUT…. . Uh, I don’t think my parents would support it… . . I’m Mentally Ill (because of loss), Asian, Malnourished,  And Terrified Of Facing Myself! Hell, I might even have an alter ego who I’m too afraid to mention at all to avoid being seen as a freak, which I am! I have snuuy’s hair, I have his face, LET ME BE SNUUY.. . I’ll see myself out now, I’ll get therapy too.
Well, I don’t know what’s going on in your life, but with the power of Snuuy on my side, I hope to send good wishes your way so you can one day become Snuuy
That a good thing?
Uh- bro I don’t even know I’m tryna be positive  I don’t think it’s working
Pretend it is working! 
Yippee 
I’ve seen quite a few mediocre Sunny cosplays, but this one definitely stands out!
Thank you
Thats pretty much the cosplay you could go outside with and no one would assume its a cosplay
Pretty much lol, but that just means I can dress up as Sunny whenever I want and not get judged 
I love the coaplay!!! It fits you really well!!! 
Thanks! 
IS that a Real steak knife?
Possibly 
Should i be scared then?
Very much so 
then this answer that i should run away before Sunny gets to my location and kills me in the most brutal way or more simply AHHHHHHHH
I’m already moving, start running 
Oh no 
 sunny and friends
It was probally a closet cosplay and they just had more clothes for sunny
Cool outfit, but what’s the school thing. Is it like a dress up day?
Dress to success day
Sunny? Successful?
Well, did you success?
Yes :3
Ain't nobody gonna know this cosplay
you look very cool c:
You even have stickers of Aubrey. . You are indeed Sunny😃
Wow I like the fit! 10/10
There’s a friend of mine that looks just like you but without blonde hair whatt . . Amazing cosplay though !
ngl with the lights off the clothes look like >!something!<
That's what I was thinking 😂
I’M DOING THE OUTFIT FOR COLLEGE HOW I MISSED THAT-,. Also you’re cute!!
Emo-ri
Why not go all the way with shorts and short sleeves
Too cold out for me
Cool
Following that logic, it must mean that she is >!Sunny is Ness is Sans is Matpat is the Crying Child is a Robot!<
but there is also a theory Asriel is sans and a creepy pasta that says Steven from Steven Universe is sans and a theory that the crying child is Gregory... so we gotta expand that logic:  . Sunny is OMORI is Ness is Sans is Steven Universe is Asriel is Flowey is Matpat is the other Ness is the Crying Child is Gregory is a robot. Holy shit, what a mess.
Now get a male friend to cosplay as Sunny
i love how you styled the wig! also cool photos!0
Thank you so much!! The little antenna was a real struggle haha
when you realize that Omori looks like an Asian in reality. . (I understand that it is consistent with the character but since it was a drawing I tended to unconsciously westernized)
Thank you fren 
Looks so cool!!
Thank you so much!! 
I don't know why, but when I saw the first picture I immediately thought of SIMS 4 Either way, the battle screen edit is quite cool, and that tattoo is awesome ngl
Haha I get it, I feel like it’s the contacts? :D And thank you so much 
Heyy, I've seen this picture on insta before 
Omg hi!! I did not expect to be found here :D
It's a coincidence that reddit recommended me your post but I joined the community here so it does make sense haha :D
Bro u look like you are AI generated 💀
Cool cosplay tho
I can't tell if that's a compliment lmao but thank you?? 😭 It might be my shitty camera quality making everything smooth
It's literally just him lol. . He needs a Sunny
THANK YOU CHUCKE
CHUCKLE **
Man, Sunny went out of his house after 4 years just to go to a convention center.. . Goals fr.
I wish I could cosplay Sunny in the future, but I'm much bigger than him tho.. Imagine a Kel sized Sunny lol
"That's sunny so you're actually wrong"☝️🤓. . Nah fam cuz even sunny pulled up to France.
snuuy approves
Extremely cursed (this is a compliment), maybe that’s what Sunny sees lmao
It's probably an exclusive he got from venting talks just by himself. Also, I think BunBun's name/ Sunny's annoyance toward rabbits/bunnies came from this(jealousy).
: Don't pet the bunnie, pet me!!!
That bun bun theory is kinda cute ngl. .  thanks for letting me vent sunny, just for that i will let you have a sneek peak into my room!. .  k. . *in the room*. .  this is my room! And thats my pet bunny bun bun! The cutest little guy ever!!!. . ……fuck you bun bun. .  SUNNY WHAT THE FU
bun bun:![gif](emote|freeemotespack|trollface)\*throws a carrot to sunny\*  . . . : that's my little boi  . . . :i f\*cking hate bunnies
My reason why sunny hate bunny's cause I think when he tried bun bun he got bitten accidentally
Is this annoyance the reason the B U N N I E S killing quest exists?
Probably
: *nail painting noises*. . : *nail painting noises*. . : I’m bored-. . : Sunny you’re only allowed to hang out with us if you let us paint your nails! It’s called girl time for a reason!. . : okay. . : oooh! Let’s paint your nails pink!. . : I was thinking black or blue.. maybe yellow.. what color do you want Sunny?
 beige
 isn't it kind of boring to have beige-colored nails?
 *eyes turn beige*
 your banned from the hangout.. . \*\*your'e
: No
Sunny refused to succumb.
: Wha-
 Succumb deez nuts
Sad beige child -->
Sunny gives random names to the people of Faraway. "Blue-haired girl", "American dad", and so on... It's to reflect that he's been so absent from society that doesn't know or remember those people, so he gives them nicknames by their appearance.. . But he does know the name of Bun-Bun... Implying that he must have been there before and remembers it.
AMERICAN DAD?!?!?!?!
Good Morning USA
i have a feeling that its going to be a wonderful day
he could be, but he could be unaware. Sunny doesnt speak that much yeah. fun theory, can't prove nor disprove.
to bad sunny abandoned her and killed her sister figure :D
>!(sunny hit omori over the head and it takes away 15 HP!)!<
Omori did not succumb
(sunny would shoot omori with the gun 47 times)
Omori will not succumb.
…. . Damn. When you put it that way…
…you’re evil, pal

" It's just a prank bro. "
>! Ayo pizza here !<
Oh no not the staircase itself
>! Why should you never trust stairs? !<
Come to think of it, perhaps when Sunny finally got into the car, he cried a bit because he had to let his first crush go.
if we go by the good ending, there's a chance they didn't move
Ik this a joke but Sunny probably doesn’t live THAT far away. Maybe only a few hours at most. I think they even mentioned that Aubrey was somehow able to get there during 3 days left (though that WAS a bluff). Wherever it is it would have to be somewhere far enough that Sunnys friends couldn’t hang out regularly but close enough they would all know where it is and could get there every now and again. . . But knowing the rest of the games story it wouldn’t surprise me if it wasn’t even in the same Solar System as Faraway town.
It may not equal it but there close enough to eachother that I imagine sunny would combine them into one area. His imagination has done weirder
it’s because aubrey was a USSR spy, her body was found nearby a lake after sunny’s “vacation” to germany (sunny became chancellor of germany and started ww2 till 1945)
Too bad sunny is moving away or straight up jumping off a hospital 
This is so wholesome. Makes sense that Sunny would know though. The quiet ones always keep secrets the best
Well, it could be that Aubrey really trusted Sunny because she saw him as her best friend/crush, or since she saw Mari as an older sister, maybe she saw Sunny as a brother.   . Or could it be that Omocat just recycled some assets.
Aubrey seeing Sunny as a brother would be weird... Considering how Sunny sees her. So I don't think that's true.. . To be honest, Omocat puts so much insane effort in to details that I could believe this.
Ok, I went only the Sunny route, was depressing enough to me. I don't think I want to explore even worse versions of his reality...
thats completely fair, this game is defo depressing af
I mean, sunny got into their rooms too. In fact that also happens during the gameplay, definitely happened before too
Both Sunny and Hero fist bump, due to their shared disgust and slowly disappearing anger to Sunny
It took Sunny four years to forgive himself
chop violet cow skirt ad hoc rain spoon fragile exultant political. .  *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact]()*
even in another universe Sunny still gets sent to the hospital. . man
I don’t know that the headspace characters would all forgive immediately.  They are all basically constructs of Sunny’s subconscious, and more likely to feel how Sunny thinks they’ll feel rather than have their free will.  As long as Omori wants to hide/deny the truth, I think the headspace gang might actually be less forgiving and understanding than their real world counterparts.
Yeah, I was conflicted on them.
Yeah but Omori wants them to be perfect for Sunny if his friends are awful to him, Sunny wouldnt wanna stay which is ultimately Omori's main objective.
I mean, assuming the laws of HS are consistent, they are incapable of knowing.
That’s kind of how I was approaching it.  Like IF they could know, it would be really bad, which is why they can’t know in the first place.  Real people are free to form their own opinions, but Sunny/Omori’s “idea” of his friends would probably never forgive him.
As you said it all depends on if OMORI wants them to forgive Sunny or not, but given what we see Omori tends to make them be nice to sunny even when they dont agree
Everyone talks about sunny, but have you ever thought about brasil? Do you think everyone else would forgive what brasil did?
It actually is kinda fucked up that Sunny spilled his beans without talking to him first…
I do and basically the same reaction from everyone that they gave Sunny. I think they can see it that all Basil was doing was protecting Sunny. And i think the added relief of it not actually being a suicide will add to the softening of the blow
It's hard to believe that because what subny did was an accident, and what brasil did was...welp, not an accident. Even if he was trying to help sunny, you know pretty well that making the accident look like a suicide was not the best idea, even worse coming from a 12 yo kid
True but also what he did wasnt as bad as Sunny. Like Sunny killed her Basil was at least trying to save the other sibling. ANd i think him being 12 and so innocent at the time helps them forgive. Like hey i was 12 i didnt know better
BRASIL 💀💀
That's his punishement for using the rope
Oh yeah, but Basil was PANIC PANIC PANIC PANIC PANIC WHAT DO I DO SUNNY IS GONNA GO TO PRISON MARI IS DEAD PANIC PANIC PANIC kinda of out of it whilst Sunny was "reality is not real, this is not happening, thoughts breaking down" kind of out of it.
I kinda disagree I personally think of it like, Basil is traumatised that his best friend had literally just killed someone. He believed that sunny was a gentle soul and would never to anything like that even if it was an accident. I think he feared not being able to be friends with him wether that he physically, socially or mentally and thought in the moment (while also being traumatised seeing someone so close to him also dead right before his eyes) that a suicide coverup (I don’t believe he thought it was actually a smart idea by any means) was the easiest quickest way to hide the truth, they both had mental breakdowns just in different ways. . Edits forgot a section when typing
They just don’t exist anymore for the Dream versions. And Omori isn’t a bad person. Omori can « accept » and « forgive » Sunny. After the true ending Sunny already forgave himself for the most part. Basil we don’t know that much, and since Sunny will be leaving soon they may never seen each other again !
Omori will never forgive Sunny. He exists as a reflection of his self-hatred and escapism. The moment Sunny accepts himself, Omori ceases existing, and as such will never forgive him. He will die instead.
Omori isn't a representation of his self-hatred, he's a coping mechanism. A method to repress information to protect sunny mentally. The reason omori even fights sunny is because he thinks that sunny is about to seriously endanger himself by telling the Truth, and comes to the logical fallacy that the safest option that produces the least suffering is dying. It's not a matter of killing sunny, it's saving him in his mind.
And everything Omori says to Sunny, those are not his thoughts of self-hatred being reflected back at him? The way that his manner of waking up is quite literally stabbing himself? . . Omori can be several things at once; His self-hatred, Sunny's ideal image, his coping mechanism, the vehicle of his escapism, and the barrier between memory and ignorance. But self-hatred is in there and quite a bit of it because BOY does Sunny have it in spades.
He's a coping mechanism, yes, but in the worse way possible. How Sunny coped with everything is to hide himself as Omori. Yes, Omori was created to protect Sunny, but deep under all of that, Omori also serves as an embodiment of Sunny's self-hatred and guilt.. . If anything, something else would probably take Omori's place after the ending. Perhaps a memory of Mari or the friend group as kids? That, I'm not too sure about.
I disagree with not knowing about Basil. I feel like the like secret ending shows that hes 100% forgives Sunny. I thi k at the end they only have each other until the others start forgiving them 1 by 1. Plus i doubt thats the only time the see each other. They all probably still talk and Sunny probably visits too
She was believing a lie for 4 years and now she learns that her best friend who was basically her older sister was (accidentally) killed and didn't actually commit suicide.  . I don't think that she'd just pay it forward and quickly forgive Sunny.
Did you mean to send it to someone else or?
nah i meant you jackass.
Hero was closer to Mari than everyone else, except for Sunny. He KNOWS how much Mari loved Sunny and how Sunny loved her back. He would know how shitty Sunny has been feeling after the incident. And that same Aubrey who "was closer to Sunny than Hero ever was" insulted Sunny for being a shut-in and disrespected Mari, his fucking dead sister, right in front of him.. . Aubrey has friends and what? How will it matter on Aubrey forgiving Sunny?
>He would know how shitty Sunny has been feeling after the incident. . Hero isn't some fucking Jedi who knows how to control his anger at the spot and will forgive Sunny in 2 days, he's still grieving. That's why i said Hero is a wildcard, he could genuinely (and rightfully) lash out at Sunny for the truth, just as he could just leave the room and return to his depressive state.. . If you wanna use pre-day 3 Aubrey as an argument, i'll also use depressed hero as one
>Hero isn't some fucking Jedi who knows how to control his anger at the spot and will forgive Sunny in 2 days, he's still grieving.. . Sunny spent 4 fucking years being a shut-in. You don't become a shut-in from good life, Sunny's beloved sister tragically died, Hero would at least have an approximate understanding of how Sunny must've felt. Of course Hero wouldn't forgive Sunny in 2 days, he needs time to digest this information and figure out his feelings.  . . . >If you wanna use pre-day 3 Aubrey as an argument, i'll also use depressed hero as one. . Ah yes, because people can change in 3 days at the same speed as people who change in 3 years.
>Hero would at least have an approximate understanding of how Sunny must've felt. . Yes, *eventually*, ofc he'll forgive him at one point, but faster than Aubrey ? yeah no, he'll still be pissed as hell, and way more than Aubrey . . . >because people can change in 3 days at the same speed as people who change in 3 years.. . How exactly did hero change ? he still studies hard for college according to Kel (so he just locks himself away at work basically) and Kel mentions that he's more closed off than he used to be, if anything he just tries his hardest to not think about it, so Sunny just revealing "lmao she didn't kill herself actually i did" would at best stop him from blaming himself, and at worst.....
Not sure if Sunny would even tell her about the photos tbh
Still, the only thing that matters is that Sunny forgave himself... whether others do or not doesn't matter in the end.
I mean losing yer friends is shit whether you’ve achieved a sense of self-actualization or not.
And unfortunately all that is left to the interpretation of each one (god how I hate open endings xd) and well I'll just say that if Sunny confessed the truth that means he was ready for the consequences that would come after that... it doesn't matter if they are good or bad.
I mean. By Omori not forgiving Sunny, that means a part of Sunny will never forgive himself for what he did
Hot take, but Sunny doesn't need to be forgiven for an accident. I mean, he probably needs to be *told* that he is forgiven to assuage his own guilt, but what happened really wasn't his fault at all and his friends would actually be wrong to hold it against him after the initial shock wears off and they have an opportunity to think about it soberly.. . What actually requires apology and forgiveness is the cover-up and lies. Especially on Basil's part, but Sunny went along with it of his own free will. That's what charts like this should be based on.
Oh, hundo percent agree.
yea fuck sunny
Honestly the inclusion of Omori in this list as well as Sunny is a brilliant move. The way they are positioned is almost better. Sunny will take a long time, but eventually learn to live with the guilt, but on some deep level he will never forgive himself.
I’m sorry, Sunny, but I don’t think I can forgive you yet.. . That’s okay, me neither.
What Kel did isn't even close to what Sunny and Basil did. He might forgive eventually, but I doubt it's going to be easy considering he's the closest person to Mari next to Sunny himself. Accidental killing is one thing, but faking a suicide and making your friends believe in a cruel lie is another.
Cause Sunny killed the love of his life.
wait sunny is gonna take a long time to forgive sunny was their a second sunny all along
To be honest I think Omori would end up forgiving Sunny, too.
So it took him almost dying to forgive himself and sunny, that sounds like Not immediately
I was thinking more *from the point where everything was out in the open.
So it took him almost dying to forgive himself and sunny, that sounds like Not immediately
THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY HAS FORGIVEN SUNNY ✅
I don’t see a reason to mention the DW friends when their character is completely dissolved post-humphery. . I feel like Kel would forgive Sunny significant faster than Aubrey that perhaps he needs to be moved up a tier. . I can’t see how it’s logical for Sunny to not be in the top two tiers considering he already forgave himself at the reference point of the tier list.. . Mentioning Omori here is weirdly against the game themes but I get what you mean I guess so I’m giving it a pass.. . Overall imo not bad at all
The list I found already had them there, so I just went fuck it. Better than the one that had every single NPC and enemy. . . And I’m not sure he necessarily forgives himself by the end. I got the impression that he began the journey to forgive himself by taking the most important step.
I think he truly does, he just started that journey immediately after the accident, so it does take him a very long time, 4 years…. . What I do think though, is that Sunny needs some time to properly deal with his Sister’s death as a brother and not as a mentally hunted criminal. But that’s purely speculation.
I mean the kid’s got legal issues, the fallout of how his friends behave, etc to deal with. And trauma doesn’t easily fade away. It’s a scar that might fade, but never fully heal. And it’ll still take a good while to become benign.
True, but that doesn’t mean self forgiveness or not 
That’s fair enough. But even still, I didn’t really read the ending as him completely forgiving himself. It was way too short a timeframe, and a lot of complications that a kid his age would need years of therapy to truly accept.
Fair enough. Well who knows really, anything post good ending is by definition headcanon anyways
Hector never forgave Sunny
>!Omori is literally Sunny lol. The part of him that wants to protect Sunny from the truth, but still him.!<
He’s the part of him that will never forgive himself.
The hug suggests otherwise
It ain’t Omori that initiated that hug.
I headcanon Hero not reacting as violently or cold as some other portrayals, but at the same time not really processing his feelings until way later. (Pushing it all away to focus on "what needs done", i.e. taking care of this group of kids physically and mentally, until he finally has to confront his feelings about what happened feels in character for him). . I completely disagree with Omori, however. Omori was created to be Sunny's guardian of sorts, and he strikes me as very "On/Off" in how he views things. I believe Omori fought in the final boss because he believed that Sunny couldn't handle the truth, and so he either needed to go back to burying himself in Headspace, or die from the weight of what he did (probably influenced by hiding Sunny from his own most destructive thoughts over the years). Sunny getting back up and finishing Final Duet got through to Omori that no, Sunny could face the truth *and* live on, and that's what the hug represents. The last we see of Omori in the good ending is him dropping his knife and hugging Sunny. I just can't view Omori as being super resentful towards Sunny after the good ending.
This is accurate, really with the dream world friendssssss that would forgive him immediately, but maybe when sunny is struggling to forgive himself they will be hostile. sunny who takes a long time to forgive is also accurate. Kel and auby really wanted to restore the friendship so it makes sense that they would forgive the snuuy earlier than hero and himself, this is the tierlist of all time (oh yeah someone already said this)
No way sunny's imaginary friends would forgive him immediately whaaat
Aubrey would kill sunny and then feel guilt about sunny's dead
AW SUNNY 😭. . Yeah no I agree with this entirely
I think Basil, Aubrey, and Kel would probably forgive sunny. Kel would be a little shocked, and would take him a bit to make sense of the accident. And Aubrey would likely forgive him even if she doesn't want to because:  . 1. She still has feelings for Sunny that have resurfaced, as shown by the cutscene before they head to the tree house where Aubrey blushes and tries to tell Sunny to visit her sometime after he moves away. And when you interact with the three friends before you go to save Basil, Sunny says he will really miss Aubrey, which implies that Sunny would miss her the most.  . 2. She would probably understand why Sunny pushed Mari down the stairs on accident in a fit of rage killing her, as Aubrey did something similar with Basil that got Hero to save him. She knows she may have done the same thing had she been in his place, as Aubrey is just as mentally fragile as Basil and Sunny, considering her dad left her mother and she has to live with a neglectful/abusive mother without her father in her life. That plus having one of her two closest friends at the time die can definitely destroy a person mentally, and thus why she of all people I feel would forgive sunny first, as she knows how Sunny must of felt at that moment due to the pressure that he had felt from everyone around him that caused him to lash out.
To be fair that was in Sunny's head too
That was a memory, not a dream...
A trip down Memory Street Lamp Lane.
Memory Street Lamp Lane, where your nightmares reside! Coming on cinema 19th of february 1985!
Tbf it was the opposite of Omori's nightmares, it helped him fight them
I mean that also only happens in sunny's head
I mean when the gang tag each other we can see that they are outside. So they probably were doing their one stuff until Sunny completely doze off.
Yeah , the point I'm trying to make is that Headspace is heavily skewed into what Sunny wants
ah k
Personally, I don't think the fights were exaggerated, just that Sunny's dreams didn't include some of the more friendly moments between them (like you said, Sunny's projected crush)
I mean let's be honest, memories themselves are not faithful recreations of the real events. When we remember stuff it's usually tinged with the main emotion we associate with those memories and as such interpreted that way.. . Whether Omocat was cognizant of this during the making of Headspace is not something I would like to debate but I would like interpret that this was the case and that the representations of Kel, Hiro, Aubrey, Mari and everyone else in Headspace is more or less how Sunny felt about them than who they actually were as young children.. . This only further matches the events of the game where even when Sunny saw the actual realities of his friends in real life, Omori only projected their idealized selves to Sunny in Headspace until the final act once the >!violin was restored, in that scene it wasn't the pastel Hiro, Aubrey, and Kel that were giving Sunny words of encouragement but the "real" versions of themselves.!<. . And at the end where Sunny is presented the option to >!follow the pastel versions of his friends or follow the shadow of Basil!< this can be interpreted to be a choice to either follow the idealic fantasy of how you want to remember your friends or the harsh reality of the truth.
Very true. Headspace is literally a safe space where sunny can be a kid again and not have to worry about and relive… you know. And when you’re a kid a lot of fights between your friends just seem worse than they were when looking back in hindsight.
Oh yeah for sure! Headspace isnt an accurate representation of how things actually were, only how sunny remembers it/fantasices about it.
It's probably because Sunny never liked when they fought so it ended up getting exaggerated in Headspace.
Well yeah that’s the point the entirety of headspace is an exaggeration of sunnys childhood
Yeah, well headspace is an exaggeration of everything. Besides, that was three years ago, Sunny might not quite remember exactly what happened.
sunny already had a rough time. please stop hurting.
they were pretty much best friends but all little kids fight. over the years their headspace counterparts have probably gotten less accurate since Sunny hasn't seen his friends in a while
Honestly, I think all of the other endings (besides the true end) end with Sunny committing suicide. Sure, we see him leave in his mom's car, but who's to say he didn't end up killing himself later?
He crashed the car

I completely agree, and it really just shows how Sunny's mental state got even more fucked up in the hikikomori route.
He did push her intentionally however he didn't mean to hurt her, hell this was the first time IIRC had ever done any sort of violence to anyone proving just how shy he really was. Sunny from my understanding simply wanted space but she invaded it so she got pushed
Well, now he surely has space. Three, even.

Yeah, on other hand the images are very powerful and tell the story well on their own, but if the descriptions were in the game, some people wouldn't think that Sunny pushed her on purpose. .   . Personally I prefer them not being in the game because of the haunting feel the images alone give you, but I wish the descriptions were easier for people to find without having to dig through the game files
I think it would be cool if there was some way to access them in the Hikkomori route. Like a hybrid route where you learn the truth but it’s already too late.. . EDIT: I’m not sure how that would work, but it would be interesting I think.
it's just that undertale doesn't make their bad route creepy, while in omori the only relatively good route is sunny route, in every other route either sunny or basil commit suicide, and all friends are depressed heavily, so you actually feel guilt
aw sunny :(
SUNNY's probably never been there before though...  Still a cool thing!
Minor note: it is not entirely true that Sunny's head space is only related to things from his childhood. Note: Ren and Shawn, two head space characters, are counterparts to Karen and Sean. Those two are the couple that have literally just moved to Faraway, that you can help with their moving in party. Another bit of proof - in >!BS2,!< there's a bit of text saying "You see two boys outside playing with their pet dog". Likely that Sunny was watching Hero and Kel play with Hector.. . Sunny actually *keeps up with what's going on in Faraway.* He's just too traumatized to go out and be involved.
holy hell i didnt know that i think that makes it worse 💀
Yes!!! In hikikomori route too, I think, in a certain place you see the grown up version of the gang!!!
Actually, if it's what I think it is, that only appears if you at least started the sunny route (you can abandon it on 2 days left however)
Oh... My apologies
Is there anywhere online I can find this I wanna seeeee
The eye doesn't "open" Sunny simply looks at it for the first time after Basil forces him to and see it appear with her hair flowing in the wind. If she awakened suddenly Basil wouldn't have stood around and force Sunny to look at it (that would make him definitely a bad and sadistic person which isn't his character at all) he would have tried to untie her or sth. Mari is long dead when sunny look at her but dead people don't close their eyes on their own. Also the "vitreous stare" of the dead is a very common trope and I'm surprised there's so much controversy around this, it looks like they look at you but they don't actually look at you
You may be on to something. >! I think Omori is indicative of Sunny's fear of himself.!<
What's even better is Omori's emotions unless it's neutral aren't anything how he acts, it's a player instinct and we ARE provoking him in some context to a certain degree of hate or sadness.. . There's not a sign of remorse and solitude in Omori, even when you beat him in the ending. He is that dissociated like Sunny he just doesn't care. That symbolism for the EYE could very well show he just doesn't care.. . &#x200B;. . Anyways that's my take, I'd love to hear your thoughts <3
To me i think it foreshadows >!Both of Something and the true meaning behind that, as well as Sunny losing an eye in the end!<
(Major true ending spoiler) >!I kinda forgot which eye Sunny loses in the True ending!<, maybe it's a small hint to that? I doubt it tho
Yeah it's the same eye but i doubt it
>!that's like a 50/50 chance of being the same eye so probably not intentional!<
I think it has way more story significance than that. It's could be foreshadowing >!Sunny losing his right eye, since his right eye is closed. It might just be a coincidence, but the resemblance to Sunny's portrait with his eye stabbed out is remarkably similar.!< It's also probably a connection to be made to Something, since you know, single eye. >!Also because Mari was furious with Sunny when she died, and the last time Sunny looked at Mari, was of her corpse looking at him with a single eye. It's entirely possible that it's another instance of Mari subconsciously showing up in Sunny's brain.!<. . Or maybe I'm looking into things far too much and it's just Omori being a shonen anime protagonist
right eye\*
Oh yeah, don't know how I still get that wrong
Sunny is a good boy, Omori would utter 20 slurs about the legal migrants alone.
Common misconception! Sunny's friends are all white because he can not see skin color. This is because he is color blind.
Are you sure? Whenever Kel asks Sunny a question he says "sorry, i don't speak mexican"
What if Omori’s colorblind and Sunny isn’t
Why are they low-poly? Is this because Sunny is in a 3DS?
Are you stupid??? It's because OMORI was made in the Geometry Dash level editor.
Nah, it was clearly been made on Sonic 3 AIR, is a mod from there.
These are avatars in vrchat
r/shittygamedetails
Sunny Tate holy shit
Omor, stop eating polygons Omor, you will end up low poly Omor
I almost thought this was r/shittymoviedetails and thought they moved on to video games

Now I can't remember if there are any black characters in the game...
Are you stupid??? Omori's wearing a black shirt. 🙄 Doesn't that fulfill the DEI quota?
Idk. Same thing applies to their hair. They all have black hair.. ish. I don't think sunny thought this through .
why is this the ps2 version
he's just colorblind
Maybe because Omori designed HS to look like if it were drawn on paper. And normally kids when drawing don't color the skin they just leave it in white
ARE THOSE 3D OMORI MODELS??' WHO MADE THEM??? (emoji of sunny grinning in an evil and comical way to show i love the models)
Sunnyology scholars have been busy
Gee wilikers, I can't believe sunny boy would do this, on god.
Tbh not even whitest white people IRL are as pure #FFFFFF white as the dream world kids are. Normal people aren't born with purple hair, either. It's fantasy.
... Okay, I'm just gonna say this now. No, Sunny's not racist. Not in the Dreamworld, and not in the real world either. It's the Dreamworld. DREAMWORLD! It's literally anything. And I haven't seen any clips of Sunny being racist at all. So, no. Sunny's not racist.
what happened to them in the image why are they ps1
Probably "-keep in touch with me?" or something like that. So like after Sunny (Maxy) moves away she could be able to call him every week or so and they could chat or somrthing idrk 
Sunnyomorimaxy?

I think this is the correct answer. The way Aubrey's character is presented, she seems to be the type to keep her true feelings closed off (especially at this point in the game, where she buries it all under anger). . . Sunny used to be the one she could confide in, and that really hasn't changed.
She actually manages to say it when you go to the swing. She will be more honest there and continue that sentence.
Yes
Agree also CHERRY BOI
Imagine Sunny coming out but exclusively speaking like he's terminally online.. . "Bruh, this is not pog champ. It's not even pepega. It's sadchamp, unbased, cringe that Aubrey stole your photo album.". . "S-Sunny? What are you saying?". . >be me. . >go outside for the first time 4 years. . >pink woman . . >turnoffvolume.mp4. . "Sunny please you're scaring me.". . "THEY ARE INSIDE YOUR SKIN YOU HAVE TO GET THEM OUT FORTNITE DANCE RIGHT NOW.". . *Basil fucking runs away*
does anyone remember that "white woman spotted" 4chan post
Link???

“Sunny, i want you to conquer most of germany and cause a massive world war”
SUNNY WAS AUSTRIAN ALL ALONG???
No, just a Hohenzollern
*Heil dir im Siegerkranz intensifies*
Sunny has uncovered a very unusual part of his family lineage
sunny… you’ll visit me right?…  right..? 

&#x200B;. . 
 Of course I will... In hell!
Oh, well, as I remember when you interact with Sunny's mom note at bathroom about cleaning teeth each morning, it gives you option to clean your teeth lol (at least on True Route)
Yeah i didn't know she left notes around the house too... . . Yeah i wanted to see where story goes so bad i might have ignored some things....
visit them, she said this when she was on the swing with sunny
It's more that she said this when they were >!staying at Basil's house, since you can get the swing scene before going to Sunny's house!<
this will be on his grave:. . Here lies Sunny, he did it, the madlad did it and he shall be remembered as a legend.
Holy OmoriSunnyMaxy!
I always found this dialogue to have some romantic implications since she probably wanted sunny to keep in touch with her, and the fact she pulled him aside to say it. That is how I interpret it anyway...
x2
She probably asked sunny to write to her every now and then
Everyone is saying “keep in touch” but at that point in the story she might have already said that to Sunny. I think she was going to say “Take me with you” as a spur of the moment thing but when she got interrupted she thought twice. Her home life is NOT good. But I think she changed her mind because she has friends in Faraway Town.
i thought she was going to tell sunny that she had a crush on him!
Sunnyomorimaxy???
Send me pictures daily on Instagram to remind me of what I’ve lost… no because I really love you sunny. So hum you see. Send pictures daily babe.
Jajaja
sunnyomorimaxy B)
"So Sunny, I heard the interesting rumor that you're single". . Most funny one I could think of
It may be optional, but it's pretty much implied it's canon, the non-stabbing option is more of a secret hid there by the developers, like the pepper spray on two days left. And yeah, she apologized, but you know what she was mocking right? It wasn't something light lol. . Plus my point stands: It's pretty annoying seeing people take this out of context just to ship two characters instead of acknowledgeing what's in front of their eyes: In Basil house, she confirms she was asking for him to visit *them*, not her. Developing a crush for someone you haven't seen in 4 years who just stabbed you is literally impossible. . And that's another: Aubrey never liked Sunny, rather the other way around: He was the one with the crush, and eventually this crush faded away, and the one who kept it was OMORI (pretty much because he's like some copy of 12yo Sunny full of regrets that is made to prevent the truth from escaping, so being like a 12yo Sunny that doesn't grow up it's obvious OMORI crush will stay, while I don't think Sunny is much of a romantic guy especially after everything everyone went through). So Aubrey starting to crush on him two days after he stabbed her and after she mocked him for shutting himself in for 4 years, plus all the other stuff that goes on in RW (like the church scene where she fights him once again, or the lake where she fights him ONCE again) would be extremely creepy, bizarre and overall not a healthy message. . I always say, live and let live, I don't have anything against the ship itself, it's just not for me. Problem is when the shippers try to spam it everywhere lol. Instead of seeing it as a wholesome moment between a group of friends they see it as a future wedding lol. . (Btw, this is not a critic to u, don't know if u did what I said lol, just overall for those annoying Sunburn shippers that try to force their ship down everyone's throat. I have some friends and buddies that are Sunburn shippers, and they agree on how annoying most of them can be. As I said, nothing against the ship itself, rather everyone who spams about it in comments sections not related to it lol)
How can I get the free robux you owe me sunny 
No one listens to The Cure anymore Sunny, get over it.
I always thought she wanted Sunny to take her with him, considering her family situation and all
*Sunny can't escape due to enemy's Shadow Tag!*
Makes sense tho
That's why the run option doesn't work against the Somethings
>!SUNNY I TURNED MYSELF INTO A POKEMON!<
Yeah, I thought she and Sunny wore those outfits because they look like what you'd wear to a recital at that age
Headspace is Sunny’s mind though and Sunny wouldn’t know about that since he was inside. I think it’s just a design choice seeing as Hero is the healer so he won’t do a lot of damage and the speed is so he goes last to help him heal people
While I like the theory, I can’t picture Sunny imagining him or anyone else as they were post-incident because they’d just remind him of it.
Lmao it was so obvious that even 12 year old sunny could tell they had a thing for each other and it transferred to headspace
Sunny canonically played Pokémon (basically)
>!This would be plausible if headspace was created by sunny before when Mari died. However, it's pretty clearly stated that sunny created headspace after her death. Sunny would have no reason to throw out over a half a year of information including several of his friends birthdays and countless other memories to be repurposed as headspace content. Many of the in-game references to faraways IRL events would have been straight up thrown out if that was the case.!<
Actually, didn't Sunny always had a headspace? They confirm this somewhere in headspace where the dreamer would be there before from time to time >!but when the funni occured, he took a doppelganger and went there waaaaayyyy too much!<. . cant spoiler for shit
It being at the church seems like a slight conflict with what we see ingame too.. . >!The memory lane segment seemed to show what looked more like a concert hall, possibly a school auditorium or something. But, I guess since it never actually happened, Sunny could've taken some liberties with it in his own mind.!<. . Not against this new information though.
That could’ve been just how sunny envisioned it, but also, this game is completely notorious for conflicting information, most people just say it’s sunny being an unreliable narrator, but that’s more than likely just an excuse.
darker theory, sunny just literally has no idea what year it is anymore, and headspace just changes it all the time randomly
Im just confused because i assume the breaven code is Sunny's birthday (07201969) making his date of birth July 20th 1969 and hes what 16 in the main events of the game? So it should be 1985 right?? But the gameboy was release in 1989
I think that's just a moon landing easter egg, which is also Sunny's birthday. Sunny is probably just a space nerd.. . It's most likely not 1985, but honestly, if you go by latchkey kid vibes alone for dating the time period of the game, it's not completely excluded.. . But there's other tech in the game that either was really not prevalent yet or just didn't exist at all in '85, like DVDs, the internet, laptops that aren't bulky dinosaurs, a somewhat more "modern" Windows-like OS, etc.
its between 1993-2000s. cus in one of the photos we see sunny playing with a Play It Loud red gameboy which came out in 1995. so if we add up the 4 years after the incident, we get a vague year of 1999-2000, so this is definetely a mistake.
Are we sure it's a gameboy? It could have been one of [these things](), which have existed since the 70s in one form or another.
on the birthday photo i saw a cartridge loading port on the back, which is on the red 1995 Play It Loud gameboy
I like to assume that it takes place in either 2000-2008. I assume that because of the technology, especially the computer SUNNY has in his room, seeing as it looks mostly like a Windows XP.
Sunny hates ketchup but loves tomatoes. It's quite strange
That's me
I used to be the exact opposite lol
Bruh that's me too
The Sunny one is literally why I hate ketchup
Sunny can by extension speak shakespearean english because of all the books he’s read/reading Shakespeare’s plays
The reason dream Hero, Aubrey and Kel look the way they do is because Sunny was modeling them of the style of the Captain Spaceboy comic. That's where a lot of the aesthetic of Headspace comes from, plus all of Sunny's memories of the real world.
Sunny can’t eat steak anymore. After he threw up that one time from eating it in the middle of the night, steak has unironically tasted like vomit to him ever since.
The mom says the power was going to go out that night and he hallucinated the microwave being on so he just ate raw steak
…Sunny’s mom did mention the power going out in the house…
I don't think microwaving a steak is enough to cook it...
That’s probably why he threw up now that I think about it. It wasn’t fully cooked.
She said that only the lights *might* go out. Not that all power would go out. He didn't hallucinate anything
He ate raw beef
Actually he ate a plate of fried tofu, he just hallucinated that it was a steak
Wait, is that an American thing? that the lights work independently of energy? I don't remember that dialogue clearly
I’m not sure if it’s an american thing or not, but depending on how your house is wired it is sometimes possible to lose power to only your lights while other things still work. I don’t really know the details of how it works, but perhaps omocat was thinking of something like that when the dialogue was written.. . It’s not entirely realistic in the case of Omori since Sunny’s mom presumably stopped paying the electric bills, which in real life would cause all lights and appliances to go out. But since they apparently didn’t lose power to their appliances then I think Sunnys mom only specifying that the lights might go out is important to note. Either it’s an omori thing or a weird oversight
I am American and can confirm that in certain circumstances, the Lights are on their own source, although connected to the main grid through the electrical box
It was a cat fight and Sunny didn’t have his knife.
>!Basil stabbed sunny in the eye and sunny woke up before he did !<
Yeah, that doesn't change the fact he is a malnourished child who hasn't seen real sunlight in four years
Basil explicitly woke up after Sunny in post credit scene in true ending and we know how fight went. Sunny beat his ass barehanded so bad even with missing eye he managed to get his shit together faster than him to do by far hardest thing in his life - tell his friends the truth.. . Game literally shows you Sunny is stronger and yet you bend your back backwards to make arguments not supported by any evidence. There is simply nothing more to it.
I like how people can't believe sunny really beat basil that hard for some reason
It’s probably cause Sunny spent most of his time sleeping and never going outside and barely eating anything for 4 years while Basil was at least active during that time
Yahp, and yet he got beat up by 4yr shut in malnourished boy for some reason
My brother in christ have you not seen the moves Sunny has?! Persist allows him to survive any attack! Focus makes his attacks stronger! By just calming down he can heal his wounds!
Imo this speaks more to willpower or emotional strength rather than physical strength tho
Sunny and Mari are the descendants of Jesus Christ their cousin is Sophie Neveu and the truth about Sunny’s lineage can be found in Sweetheart’s Royal Gallery where “Mona Sweetheart” is just a clue in part of an elaborate cover-up of the true descendants of the messiah.
Sunny buys an r32 and mods it and joins street racing events in the city earning lots of vbucks cuz he speedruns and always wins. . He dies like Hans from Tokyo Drift leaving behind a daughter and son who take on his legacy (legally)
Sunny can be very proficient, but only when he chooses to. This leads to him being usually lazy, or atleast seen as such, since he is saving energy for something he is actually invested in.
practice your violin more, my lazy brother . . I just know you could be proficient at it if you actually tried. You’re going to suck at our recital tomorrow. What a shame. What are you saving your energy for anyway you little brat? Tsk tsk.
- Sunny likes well done steak(everyone calls him out on it). - The gang tries to hook up basil and Charlie after the shenanigans happen . - Kel was prepared to throw the ball at the window if Sunny didn’t answer
-Omori and headspace are still around after the good ending, but Sunny only sees them when asleep or having a panic attack. . -Basil loves plants, so he eats mostly meat to protect the plants. . -Kel has a crush on Mincy the artist. . -Aubrey is part Italian . . -Hero switches his major after the good ending, to become a chef. . -Mari came up with the name Sunny for her baby brother. . -Sweetheart in the anime series is a lovable ditz, her headspace personality is based on the candy shop owner. . -Something is Mari's ghost. . -Sunny is a writer. . -Captain Spaceboy the animated series is Kel's favorite show. . -Sunny will only watch the Sweetheart anime in Japanese . . -Aubrey likes the Sweetheart anime. . -everyone has a headspace. . -the brand of Sunny's violin is called Hikiko. . -Hero ends up trapped in his college dorm one day, and calls Kel. Amid fearful tears, he tells Kel something horrifying happened. There's a spider in his room
i like the "everyone has a headspace" that's a cool concept i wonder what they would all look like
I-it was all a dream *sniff* sunny didn’t do anything wrong a-and they lived happily every after all of them.
*But the top stops spinning tho*
Sunny is autistic
He just like me fr
same
trauma induced autism. lacks affect, nonverbal.
Im sorry but what is trauma induced autism? I thought autism was a neurodivergence that someone has ever since their birth, and not through a trauma
You're right. The consensus is that autism is genetic. Sunny may have childhood PTSD which displays autism-like symptoms. Because of this, I think its possible that Sunny could recover from his disorder.
>!the tragedy of being the listener of a group of deaf people(metaphorically speaking) that talk too much about they problems and never let you to talk about your problems... what a sad thing of Sunny's life!<
>!Excatly, That applies even more to Aubrey since apart from owing Sunny for those talks on the swings... there's also the lake incident and if it wasn't for Hero she would have ended up worse off than Sunny (and even more so if the truth is revealed knowing that she killed two of her old friends because of a tantrum... and was only saved by sheer luck), not forgiving him would be hypocritical and even an insult to Mari in a way. Maybe when things calm down she'll try to go around the table and let Sunny vent to her... after all it's a favor she should repay.!<
>!Oh yeah that too!<
>!I always pictured that after the good ending, Sunny kept a photo of Mari with him in his wallet or something, as a constant reminder of what happened and to give him the resolve to move forward. It's like Edward's pocket watch in FMA, and like that, it's very private to him.!<. . >!Another Sunny one - I think even after the good ending he struggles crying and being vulnerable quite a bit. I think it'd take him a while to really have a breakdown in front of his friends. !<. . >!The hospital scene would play out very similarly to the scene in Spider-Man 2 where Peter talks about the night Uncle Ben dies to Aunt May. Sunny talks about it in an almost dissociated way, but not to the point where you can't tell he's one step away from having a breakdown. And this applies to how the friends would react as well, very similar to Aunt May they'd probably be horrified at it and need their space from Sunny, not immediately forgiving him. Here's the scene for reference: . . On a lighter note, I think Sunny would really like Jamiroquai.
Sunny is the one guy who would beat everyone in a video game once he learns all the game’s mechanics and strategies.
OMORIBOY is Sunny Post-Hikikomori Route.
-Sunny: has moved on to a building with His parents. Goes to a music academy, asked so hardly for His violin to be repaired. Also, has improved a lot in playing the violin.. . -Aubrey: has left the hooligangs, wants to reconsider all her thoughts and Is sorry for bullying an innocent child. Sometimes visits Sunny on holidays, because still cares for his health and safeness. Also, she got a job on McDonalds, so she didn't need to live in the misery. Keeps getting Angry oftenly, and secretly likes bunnies. . -Kel: same as before, resilient and positive, likes sports, ice cream and Orange Joe. Sometimes he and His family visit Sunny because he wanna see how Sunny's doing… and have some fun.. . -Hero: doesn't feel actually right, hasn't forgiven Sunny for almost a year. Still keeps being friends with Sunny and makes sure everyone is good, healthy, safe and happy. Kel seems to notice something wrong with Hero.. . -Basil: has confessed the reasons he considered suicide, cares very much for Sunny More than Aubrey could possibly do. Also, Basil takes care much More than before for His flowers, and has Made a pretty, beautiful garden in honor to all His friends (Mari included). . -Mari: even dead, she's the reason why all her friends are alive, together and happy. She Is happy when everyone Is happy. . Also Sunny: keeps going to the dreamworld, where he has fum with His dreamfriends… and keeps fighting Omori in order for self-improvement. . PD: pls make the kiddos play Sburb in Homestuck
- >! The big yellow cat was only made after Abbi was banished to the Abyss as a way the keep the headspace “in check” and make sure that it doesn’t spiral out of control.!<. . - >! Omori doesn’t know that it was Sunny who killed Mari, instead pushing all of the blame onto Basil because he is Sunny’s coping mechanism.!<
Sunny has serious developmental disorders and social problems due to his isolation and his friends are even more cool than the game indicates because he’s basically disabled at this point. Kel is bringing his special needs friend around town because he cares about Sunny despite the lack of speech and the knife-wielding.. . Oh and lots of people know that there was some sort of accident and that it was covered up. Aubrey can tell, but she blames Basil. Hero suspects something is up but he can’t bring himself to ask why or how. It’s in there between the lines, everyone’s waiting for Sunny to tell them the truth.
- >!Sunny kills himself after the good ending because he thinks he ruined everyone's lives again!<

































-sunny grew to stop fearing something and is now "getting along" with.. It (he learned to ignore it from time to time and focus on others stuff) . . -Basil owns a Venus fly trap and he likes horror movies. . -kel is trans no matter what you say to me he is trans. . -sunny used to own a sort of blond cat who he called basil (This was before he met Basil sadly the cat passed of old age) . . -omori likes to draw he is good at it but doesn't have time to draw since he most of the time hangs out with the dreamworld people. . -Mari and sunny used to wear matching braclets, sunny now wears his and mari's on both of his hands . . -hero gets over his fear of spiders and in the very far future adopts a tarantula.
Sunny dies and your an ghost watching Sunny Other Things Than Die.
Sunny wasn’t forgiven by any of his friends.
stop breaking my heart
The credits of the true ending is actually Sunny being taken away to jail in a police car.



A new photo album. He gave his to SUNNY. Happy Birthday Brazil
Yay
i would cosplay sunny and stab him. . yep thats my gift
:(
i want to give sunny his godamn eye
I would also like to add that even if the parents found out there were suspicious circumstances they would never suspect Sunny, their own son, unless he confessed. Arguably they would first suspect Basil and Basil would have cracked under pressure from any direct interrogation.. . Also, and maybe I should have lead with this, but there is actually a perfectly logical explanation for the parent lines not being about the crime but also still being true: **they are about Sunny becoming a hikikomori**. Think about it, all we hear about implies Sunny has barely left home at all in five years, to the point Kel mentions his speech skills have suffered. He wants to stay inside? His mother will protect and support him because he is their only son, and maybe dad disagreed, harshly.
^("Put another way: the bitter irony of Sunny's (and Basil's suffering  that we come to learn is that it is exclusively self-inflicted. You'd be  forgiven for thinking toward the beginning of OMORI that Sunny's trauma  must've meant he was, like, physically tortured or something from how  severe his fears are, and yet...no. He is  his punisher. The ultimate hurdle in his psychological journey is him  coming face-to-face with reality and choosing to accept and admit the  truth. That gets taken away if he loses total ownership over that act -  which he would, if his parents knew too."). . Well, you just completely changed my mind about the parents and in fact, gave me an informative take on the game that I really enjoy. Thanks!
But, I also want to point out that the memory/black space room of Sunny's father (supposedly) cutting down the tree does have some basis in reality- the tree that Mari was hung in is cut down after all.
it's also established, however, that sunny was able to keep up with a routine for some time after the tragedy. (in real life, aubrey says "when sunny stopped going to school with basil" implying he even went to school with basil in the first place) and therefore it wouldn't be a far stretch to think that sunny was, indeed, outside and saw his father chop down the tree.
Wow this is so good, like really fucking good. I hadn’t put that much thought into the parents knew theory but you managed, through a single post, to make me familiar with it and make me disagree with it also. Amazing read, totally worth it.
Damn good analysis goes to show how deep this games narrative really is! . . To me I never knew the whole parents knowing theory was a more negative light of the story but then again I tried to steer clear of the theory stuff until after I played through all the routes of the game and explored most of the black space(s) secrets. . . I just wanted to talk about the Father specifically as I realized some things in reading your analysis.. What I find really peculiar is that the father is super unknown, perhaps the most "mysterious" out if the main characters. Only 2 lines of dialogue (that I know of) both which come from black space, out of all places. Agreeing with your analysis in regards to Sunny being an unreliable narrator, I can see that the father could very well still be with the mother/family dynamic and after the incident either:. . A) refuses to speak with his son. B) Sunny doesn't have the courage, desire etc to approach let alone interact with his father. . This is just a theory, but perhaps throughout his life Sunny was held at a high standard from his father, failing time and time again to get his father's approval resulting in a crippled relation. We've seen in the real world album that Sunny is quiet, reserved, struggled in excelling in activities (violin in this case) vs his sister who was much more outgoing and excelled in many areas (piano, softball). Coming from an Asian background (Japanese), one "old school" element in such culture is that sons are more desired over daughters. Of course not all asian cultures have this element but it exists within mine.. . Now, saying this family has this "old school" element mentioned before, why would the father just up and leave the family without even attempting anything to help his son? Help solve the issues his son has? Regardless I wouldn't be surprised if there was a hidden narrative even though there is no evidence for such a narrative.. . Some additional things of note about the Father in relation to some aspects: . Does Sunny represent his father as Daddy Long legs? (I cannot remember the npcs full dialogue which I so desperately need to research) . Is there a connection with Sunny and his father with the interactions between Space Father and Capt. spaceboy? . The peculiar inclusion of the father in the family portraits? (This point I only mention due to the typical ways movies, media etc show the father figure or any parental figure leaving the family such as a greyed out face, cut from a photo etc.). The father could be or could not be around but since we are experiencing everything through Sunny's perspective no finite answer will ever be given, it's a matter of interpretation. . . Guess what I'm attempting to get at is the relationship between Sunny and his father is fractured and Sunny chooses to avoid his Father as much as possible. Seeing how Sunny actually erases real world events (the closet) from his perception among many other things, I don't think it's too far fetched to think he might've done the same with his father.. . Again just winded conjecture but wanted to provide another perspective to this awesome analysis of this gem of a game!
This is a wonderful theory, and one that genuinely made me think, but there's something that doesn't add up in my mind.. . If his parents, and more specifically his mother, genuinely thought Mari's death was a suicide, why would they leave their only (16 year old) son who already shows worrying behaviour home alone for three whole days? He doesn't answer calls, and yet his mother doesn't come back for him or even check up on him. And she doesn't hate him, either, we know this.. It's almost like she wants to protect him, but she also knows he's moderately dangerous to other people.. . To me, they know about Sunny's involvement.. Not because of autopsies, or the police finding out, but because they knew Mari and they knew Sunny.. Mari showed no symptoms and Sunny showed all of them - and where's his violin, if not in the toy box that Mari allegedly used for her own death?. Even if they didn't open it... they must have noticed something was off.. . This doesn't affect the story to me, though, as like you said, the parents don't really matter. The game is about Sunny's own coping.
Thank you. Some thoughts on what you wrote:. . - The whole premise of mom leaving Sunny alone is odd, mostly because of the mixed funny-straight tone of her voicemails. If the game played them straight throughout then I don’t think there’d be much question of what’s happening: a single parent had to leave their teen child home alone while finalizing prep for their move. But for the mom to just laugh off the fact that the power’s cutting out is really bizarre. I wouldn’t have written it that way.. - “Why did his mom leave him home alone?” and “Why doesn’t she check up on him?” are pretty similar questions to “Why would Sunny stupidly push his sister in the one direction that could cause her harm?” - we wouldn’t have a game if they didn’t. If we need in-universe explanations I think they’re easy enough to come up with: his mom is a single parent and couldn’t be in two places at once, and the game never specified where they’re moving to (besides “the city”). Maybe they’re moving out-of-state or somewhere far enough that it wouldn’t be practical for her to come back.. - I don’t think it’s super unrealistic for a parent to leave a 16-year old alone for three days. That’s essentially a weekend; he’s old enough to be able to cook and clean himself, and crime isn’t really a big concern in the suburbs. Note that she mentions that she *thinks* the power might go out, so even then it’s not like she’s knowingly leaving him w/o power - it’s just a possibility to her.. - All these aside, I definitely don’t see evidence for Parents Knew in this. If anything, I’d say it’s even stranger for Mom, knowing that Sunny is a homicidal maniac, to *encourage him* to hang out with Kel unsupervised! Does she want Kel to take a fall too? Like presumably if Parents Knew then mom would have to be keeping a close eye on him if she wouldn’t report it to the police...that makes the chance of her not arranging him to come to the city with her even less likely.. - What symptoms are you saying Sunny showed? He’s always been described as a shy boy, even before Mari’s death. His reclusiveness could just be read as him not making new friends when the old group fell apart four years ago.
I understand what you are talking about, again, but to me the weirdest part isn't the tone of her voice mails or the fact that she left her 16 year old unsupervised (I was left unsupervised at that age as well), but that she did all this while believing her daughter had commited suicide, and knowing Sunny doesn't seem all that mentally stable as he hasn't left the house in four years.. . I think she could have forced him to go along with her if suicide was really on her mind - it doesn't seem that hard to do something like that, knowing he is pretty weak both physically and mentally.. . I think that she let him go out with Kel in hopes that he would remember some of the fun times, when he still went outside and was less reclusive - she probably wants him to be normal, I don't think she believes him to be this unstoppable murderous force or anything, nor a danger to society in any way... if she knows, she is probably slightly afraid of being in the same home where the "accident" happened, alone with him.. . And for the symptoms that Sunny showed - of course he was shy, but I think his own parents would notice if something is off. They could definitely brush off him being unwilling to go outside as sadness from his sister's death, but I think it is probable that, being both of their parents, they could add up Mari's apparent absence of any motive or suicide letter of any kind with their son's changed behaviour, which could be read as closing himself off not to harm anyone else.. . That said -. I absolutely love exchanging opinions with other people who are as serious as me about game analysis, and I'm not trying to pick apart your theory, only stating some thoughts. I think both Parents Knew and Parents Didn't Know theories are equally enriching to the story.
I think she's just an absentee mother to be honest. Just like the father.
Just to ask: if Sunny's mom doesn't know the truth, and Sunny decides to tell her the truth...¿how do you think she would react?.. . It's just a question for a hypothetical scenario, if you ask me well...I don't think she takes it very well...but this is just the way I see it.
wrt sunny's mom just leaving him at home: while I think it's more of a plot device to show that he 1. has parents but 2. is alone for the main story to work, i try to explain it away like this. the mother's first born, her only daughter, has killed herself in her backyard while presumably away from home. instead of turning in the direction one might expect—overprotectiveness of sunny, never letting him leave her sights, always pressing him to open up—she goes the opposite way. her husband left her shortly after her daughter's suicide, her life is completely falling apart and she just wants it all to go away. she's tried staying at home but it just brings back bad memories. she wants to feel like everything is normal, so she travels for work, travels for sales, finds any reason not to be at home. seeing sunny just remind her of mari's face, and it can hurt. she would never say that to him of course, but she finds reasons to avoid looking at him. it's not for a lack of love—she makes sure to leave him phone messages, to leave sweet notes all over the home, to leave food for him while she's gone—she just can't bear to be in that house with that face reminded her of the worst moment of her life. sunny clearly goes emotionally catatonic, so perhaps because he's not broken down externally, the mother further allows herself to indulge in her fantasies of everything being normal. her whitespace is abroad, while sunny's is inside. . of course, this could all be a total load of horse shit that i'm using to explain away plot holes, but yknow ... ¯\\\(ツ)/¯
I'm still of the idea that she did know that her daughter did not kill herself.. First of all, it is unknown if she was away from home or not when she died, but it happened during the day, the night of which the recital was to happen. You can clearly see light in all of the truth album pictures, so one can assume she probably was in the house.. Your theory is good and plausible, but I don't think it is a plothole in the first place - it is never said if she works far away or not, during the game she's away because of the move-in, and even then, I think it is because she knows he killed Mari, and she knows he partly did it on purpose. You're right, she probably does not want to look at him.. But to me, she loves Sunny a lot, she cares about him, and if you genuinely thought your own first born daughter killed herself and you could have stopped it, you would not create the same exact situation where you could lose another child.. Mari showed no symptoms of being suicidal, not with her parents, nor her boyfriend, after all. She was looking forward to the recital, and Sunny's violin mysteriously disappeared - I think a parent could piece together what happened without an autopsy.
My opinion on the matter is that the parents do not know because they could either be doing something early in the morning, (ex. Getting a haircut or groceries or etc.) or if we assume that they did or do work close to there house, they could be on a night shift (ex. My mom worked night shift when I was a kid)
To explain why the mother wouldn’t believe that sunny killed Mari, we can look to three thing. One was that Mari was a perfectionist that was clearly stressed, and if she was more stressed than usual, she may have felt that she was not good enough to play and that would lead her to spiral out of control. Another possible cause is what would lead basil or sunny to kill her. If either of the parents were not there when this happened and returned to see that she killed herself, there may not have been any justification given for them to kill her. Thirdly, there are many cases of suicide where there is no cause given, and as I have displayed with my first point, this could have caused her to do it. Furthermore if you came back to your sister being dead and your son not having any emotion, it could be read as him closing himself off because she was so important to her, and that her death eventually shocked him to the point of closing himself off, like a hikiomori.

good bot
This is super compelling, excellent job on this, just gonna preface I haven't finished reading btw, this is just a thought.. . The only thing bothering me is that lividity isn't considered here. If you don't know, lividity is the gravitational pooling of blood post-death, and it sets in pretty damn fast. . . Assuming Mari did die from the fall, the fact that she was laying down for a long time (Lividity can set in after like, 30 minutes, and I reckon Sunny would have been crying for much longer than that, especially as it looks like Basil wakes Sunny up to move the body) before Sunny and Basil hung her would mean that she'd have red/purple colouration along the back of her body. The parents discovering this would think that it's surely odd that all the blood colouration would be on her back, and not in her legs, right? After all, we never actually see her back clearly, so it's a possibility. . . Just a thought. . Edit: Finished reading, I agree with you on the writing aspect, but at the same time it's still fun to think about these things :P
Thank you. Y’know, I’m a fan of crime fiction/true crime and so am vaguely familiar with the decomposition process from that, but even now this is the first I’ve heard of lividity in minute detail. I would bet my left kidney that the game’s writers were unfamiliar with it too, lol. So, while it sounds like your observation is accurate, it feels more appropriate to me to slot this into the “blame the writers” category along with the physical outcome of her fall.
This is true, I feel like on a forensic level, a lot of stuff can be disproven in this case, so you're probably right :P And yeah, I remember hearing about it in a Bailey Sarian video and always thought lividity was such a bizarre thing.. . I recommend watching [this]() if you're interested in true crime! Especially as it goes into some similar stuff involving hanging, and lividity giving some things away.
The thing is, there is a photo of Sunny putting Mary's corpse to bed and then a photo of him carrying her back down the stairs. It's not necessarily true that she was left there on the floor for very long.
I think for most people (including me to be honest), the "parents knew" scenario is the only way to explain away the game's biggest (and unfortunately, most crucial) plothole that the **coverup is completely, utterly unbelievable**.. . The amount and type of trauma sustained by falling backwards off a staircase would look absolutely nothing like those found in a hanging in an autopsy, since there would be bruises, fractures etc from blunt force trauma all over her body, while hanging would be localized all into one area. Like, let's be clear here, I am not a forensic expert, but **Jesus Christ** I thought it was disappointing that the main twist seems like it's a gigantic writing blunder considering the rest of the entire game is written so damn well.. . The notes on the Black World photo album do mention that her body appeared almost immaculate after the fall, but I don't see why these album captions have to be any more or less trustworthy than any other source or interaction in the game; it could simply be Omori's last glimpse of Mari in her not-hanging state thus remembers it more fondly. You mention internal decapitation, which if we really stretch our suspension of disbelief and accept that it's possible literally only her neck got damaged in the fall, the type of fracture would almost assuredly not align with self-hangings (since I would assume most people don't have enough height to produce the force for this and rather would have crushed windpipes). It would be up in the air whether or not police would be willing to do an autopsy I suppose, but considering she (no offense to anyone) doesn't fit the general description of someone who would hang themselves combined with I'm SURE hangings have been used as a coverup before, I would wager they would push for one. They would assuredly find chips Sunny missed from the violin on her clothes and a toy chest locked in a closet combined with a key attached to a photo saying exactly where it goes to ain't exactly the most air-tight hiding spot.. . Basically, to reiterate my starting point, holding onto the "the parents knew" scenario IMO is a band-aid I'm putting on the story to cover up this (again, IMO) massive blunder in the plot. If you take this assumption, the hole appears to be nicely filled.. . One other way you could fill this hole, (looking over that the photo of Sunny pushing Mari down the stairs literally says "Photo of a Murder"), I think the final photo may imply that she may actually not have been dead at the time. This would allow the "uninjured body" reality to exist, as well as it looking like a death-by-hanging (because IT WAS). I think the final caption at least intentionally leaves this open as a possibility since Sunny didn't just internalize their own reaction, they internalized BASIL'S reaction as well meaning they both saw the same thing.   . . There's also that one black space room with the hospital beds that eventually flat-line. If she was dead already, then she wouldn't have been able to go to the hospital at all, right? Again, black space, it might have never happened, but why is a hospital in his black space?. . That's just my two cents.
Thanks for the pushback. While it seems like I’m in lockstep with the game’s explanation of things here let me note a few things I’m also skeptical of:. . * It’s a bit hard to believe that Sunny’s parents would never inquire about the violin, given that he’d been practicing so long and so hard for the recital and that the recital was just around the corner when she died. * There remains some open questions about the circumstances of the night of her death. Basil seemed to sleep through the violin and Mari crashing down the steps, which strains credulity. And so would the parents, unless they weren’t home that night.. . So I would agree that an editor or two would have been helpful to the writers (and a doctor, I suppose, to clear up the medical issues).. . Regarding challenging the veracity of the cursed photo book captions, a big problem with a game like OMORI is figuring out where to draw the line of what information is trustworthy. Since the entirety of Dream World is at the behest of his (sub)conscious mind and even the Real World can’t always be trusted at face value, what serves as objective info? If we go by the most conservative metrics to be safest (must be in Real World, must be verified by someone besides Sunny) we have very little to work off of.. . Take, for instance, Mari at the end of normal route when she appears with the piano to console Sunny and encourage him to forgive himself. Short of spiritual readings of the game that this is literally her spirit speaking to Sunny (which I’d strongly disagree with), what are we supposed to make of this? Is this an accurate portrayal of Mari’s thoughts on the situation being relayed by Sunny, or is just a deeper layer to the psychology that explores how he’s pivoting to accept the truth and forgive himself?. . How you’d draw the line in that scenario, let alone the tons of others the game presents, will probably boil down to personal preference, esp. one’s own first thoughts that occurred while playing the game. For me, I’m inclined to support the cursed photo captions because they not only align with the events depicted in the photos but they offer novel insight into Sunny’s motivations on that day. If you lower your threshold enough that corresponding with the photos is enough to prove them valid, then you’ve now got a new trove of reliable info *including* the firsthand insight into the state of Mari’s body.. . Ultimately, like I said in my conclusion, if Parents Knew makes your experience with the game better, than that’s good. I’m not here to take that away. Part of my writing this was just not understanding why people were so drawn to the theory, but I think I get it now: since your biggest sticking point wasn’t the emotional drama but rather the plothole in the sequence of events, this made the most sense.
Most of the game's tragedy is rooted brutal mundanity, so I get why you think Mary's ghost could not be a literal thing, but many parts of the game imply that there's an ever present supernatural element to what is happening. Just because it all has surface level plausible deniability in "it might be a delusion by a very deluded person", that doesn't explain everything perfectly.
The nightmares about people flatlining comes from Sunny's realization that Mari is not breathing when in a panicked state he carries her back up the stairs and tries to lay her down in her bed before Basil confronts him, I think.
He also helped carry her upstairs. Sunny mentions twice that "[Mari's] body feels lighter than you think" in the cursed photo album, either because Sunny had a fight or flight response, or because someone helped him. This is using datamined evidence though.
This point is the only thing holding me back from fully accepting the OP’s theory as potentially canon.. . I don’t understand why the annotations in the Mari photo book are considered as 100% factual in OP’s theory and Omori’s visual experiences in black space aren’t. The photo book annotations are written in a purposely biased way to frame you in the mind of Sunny’s panicked and aloof mental state during the whole ordeal (“You think she’s just sleeping...”, “You pinch yourself to wake up from this dream..”, etc.) It’s clear the photo book annotations are also unreliable, so it shouldn’t be held as proof that Mari didn’t appear bruised or damaged.. . I can believe that the authors most likely didn’t take into account forensic knowledge while writing this segment, so I could forgive the fact that the parents and medical experts happened to gloss over it— but then it would essentially be considered a plot hole.. . I personally choose to believe that the parents were aware of what Sunny did as this would resolve the autopsy plot hole. Realistically, it makes no sense for a girl to appear completely unscathed after falling down a fleet of stairs and landing on a broken violin.
Very well thought out.
Thank you!
I'm so glad I read this. I really got a new appreciation for how Sunny's mentality of black space isn't 100% accurate and what happens there through the lens of self-inflicted guilt. The cut photo content was also a very interesting way of explaining Sunny's thoughts throughout the whole incident, even if it isn't completely canon in the final version of the game. Goes to show that the game is a lot more than what it says and has a lot implications.. . &#x200B;. . (On a side note, I like to explore this idea that the parents are experiencing their own guilt inflicted trauma like Sunny did. So I am making this story where it explains why they had to move, how they felt about the incident, then confess all of that to Sunny after he explains his side of the story when they visit him in the hospital.. . &#x200B;. .  I'm not even sure if you are still reading comments so uh sorry for tooting my own horn haha.). . &#x200B;. . Wonderful job with this analysis and theory!
Man I know that some things can be held in headcannon but seeing proof that Aubrey might not have a thing for sunny makes me feel bad for him since it would be nice for him to get a win but now I don't feel so sure :(. Other than that this was a fantastic read even though this is an month old
quick question if you don't mind, how do you get to black space two in the hermit route? I'm playing it right now and Im on the last day, I already went through normal black space and I'm afraid of missing the second black space. will it come along later in the story?
Lol no worries. You have to interact with the laptop in White Space on the fourth day in Headspace. You shouldn’t worry about going too far either; in fact, you can only manually move on to the ending by stabbing back to real life, selecting the bed, and selecting to proceed to the next day
thank you so much!!
I know this is old, but hear me out:. . People often use the "unreliable narrator" as a way to justify any of their believes about what happened in the story instead of actually looking into what is shown in the story. The "unreliable narrator" is a technique that always works when:. . 1. You have evidence of them being consistently wrong about something, which is not the case with most of what the truth segments reveal about what happened with Mari.. 2. The "unreliable narrator" cannot be always unreliable, because part of what makes this trope work is that the narrator is often someone we trust, which is why they say something right from time to time, think about Obi Wan telling that Luke's father was killed by Darth Vader and then Darth Vader saying the good within him died. They were not always wrong, but the few moments of them stating wrong stuff does not diminished the truth of the stuff they said. Obi wan is still right about the force being around them and Darth Vader is still Luke's father, you cannot expect them to be wrong all the time unless you show it.. . Because of this your counterargument to the idea that the parents did not knew doesn't work, because you have no proof that this assumption is wrong and use unrelated events as evidence for this and even then, the examples of him being unreliable aren't all good:. . \- Sunny denying the existence of the door was when he repressed the truth and it was not until he comes slowly in terms with it that it reappears to Sunny, so you ignored the context of that scene and just called him "unreliable narrator" without explaining why he did that and why the dialogue of the man is thus false. Everytime we see through the cracks left by the correct keys, more details are revealed, like what happened to Basil's photo album and the tree where Mari was hanged. . . \- That Sunny projected his romantic interests for Aubrey onto her dreamspace counterpart is largely true, but there is a piece of dialouge that hints to this being somewhat mutable, when Aubrey wanted to talk with Sunny alone in the living room with huge implication of it being romantic until it was stopped by Kel. Even if this scene had no romantic undertones, it would not prove that the black space segments are unreliable as a result, because if we cannot trust the negative parts of his memories because some of the positives ones are made up, then we cannot enjoy the game, because we need to believe in the POV of the protagonist, since it's through this lense we view this story, other than Basil's. By that logic we can say that Sunny did not kill her and that he was acting in self-defense when she blocked his path, but that isn't supported at all and all of the pictures and dialouge show clearly that no, Sunny pushed his sister in a fit of rage and the datamined text proved that as they are not contradicted by anything else in the game. . . To the parents dialouge? you need evidence to prove that they both didn't knew it because the dialouge coming from the guy cutting the tree strongly implies that this man is Sunny's father and he is calling him no longer his own son. Sunny's father is also characterized by his strong love to Mari to the point of Basil fearing his reaction to Hero being too close to her, which would make sense with how and why he would leave Sunny and his wife behind; He cared more about Mari than Sunny, even to an overprotective degree. . . The segment with the real-life scrutiny doesn't prove your point, because the Parents could always decline an autopsy and even bribe the police to keep it secret. Also Autopsies aren't done all the time on suicide vicitms, so there is that. . . Finally how exactly would them knowing about it make the story worse? They never had as strong of a tie to Sunny as his friends and them being too broken about it for them to care for Sunny would actually **justify his fears about being hated by his friends in his own mind, since he has a proof of how terribly they could take the news with his parents.** However there is a better reason to not consider the story ruined by them knowing: Sunny was never close enough with them to care about the same way he cares for his friends and considering how very little interaction he had in the past with them, it's save to say that they were mostly absent from his life and only provided him with enough care to survive, but could not create a very strong bound with him or shaped him to an individual that can regulate his emotions very well, because then the entire plot of Omori would have never happened. Mostly likely out of shame would they keep it and even then, it would be Sunny's responsibility to face the truth and not them, because as Basil said, it's Sunny's descision to carry on and make everything ok in his life and no one else, because not giving Sunny the chance to do it lead to Omori becoming powerful enough to completely destroy Sunny, which can only be prevented by Sunny choosing to reconnect with his old friends. . . Overall you need more evidence that Sunny's parents aren't knowledgable and rather than use random examples that have enough context within the story to understand why they exist and why aren't related to the very reliable segements of the game spouting the truth out loud. They could very well not know it, but then would they not have shown dialouge about them eating up the staged suicide story?
Agreed! Ps, the dream space is just that, a dream. Obviously it isn't supposed to be all that accurate, that's the point of it's existence. The black space is an entirely different place (imo it's his subconscious) that holds the truth that he buried deep down inside him. If you want to pick and choose what's real and what's not in the black space, I could say the suicide never happened. Both sunny and basil imagined it since nobody in IRL ever said to was suicide. heck! Nothing could be real!
I think this really does show the infinite possibilities you could interpret the background details of the game AND I LOVE IT.
this post was amazing, you clearly did a lot of hecking research and this post helped clear a lot of questions i had about this topic. You're writing was really well and this theory discussion was really good, earned an upvote and my thanks!
This is an amazing thread, I find the games story is way more impressive and masterful from the twist actually incorporated into the story. So people bringing up the plot twist as a negative is so strange to me cause that's really what makes the game incredible, especially when you consider that maybe Omori was hoping he would get caught, and the guilt of not makes everything hit so much harder. The game is so much better and is raised to that masterpiece level cause of that amazing twist, so I'm glad to see someone defending the situation in such a detailed manner, thanks for this, I'll make sure to remember it.
This was a great read. Thank you for compiling these points.. . I do have one question, though. Does the game actually indicate/suggest that Sunny's family is Asian-American? It's totally possible that I'd missed something, so I thought I'd ask.
Thanks. It’s never outright stated but presumed by most due to how Sunny looks. Mari’s name/his parents’ looks/the Omori-hikikomori connection/some stuff from the game’s marketing/some cut features of Sunny’s house (which you can check out by viewing my recent post on Beta OMORI) would be supporting evidence. Honestly I think there’s more ambiguity over the ‘American’ part of ‘Asian-American,’ lol.
Sorry to respond to a four-month-old post like this, but this thread was linked in a YouTube video I watched today.. . I do agree that Sunny is of Asian descent, but Faraway Town is like 99% likely to be in America.  Based solely on the icon for the Real World currency in the UI.  What other country would associate George Washington with money?. . The only real ambiguity comes from the fact that the prices listed in stores is actually what you pay, no tax applied at the register.  But that's probably for game convenience.
My thread got linked in the NicoB video? Cool, lol. Sadly all the top comments there are pushing Parents Knew and he hearted them all, so I guess he bought into it…. . Yeah, the George Washington currency thing slipped my mind at the time of posting that. It’s safe to assume the setting is the US. Taxes and whatnot are def more realism than the game is going for.
HOLY SHIT THIS  IS INCREDIBLE 10/10 WOHOOO NICE JOB
My biggest question now is why did they fake her suicide? Why not just say she fell down the stairs while practicing Violin? Seems like that would make more sense than to stage something much much worse.
What seems obvious to us as well-adjusted adults may not have been as obvious to Sunny and Basil at the time of the incident.. . Take a slight detour with me and consider this altered version of the [Trolley problem](): a little kid has their favorite teddy bear tied to the side of the tracks the train is set to hit, and on the other is a random person. They know to save the bear they need to divert the train to the person. . . They pull the lever. To us, this action is ludicrous, even unjustifiable; after all, the bear is replaceable, a person isn’t. But consider the child’s perspective: they may not be old enough to understand the permanence of death. Moreover, they have *strong* attachment to the bear, so much so that in the heat of the moment they made the rash decision to save it without considering the consequences. The point of this example is that while a decision in an objective sense can seem pretty unjustifiable, it might make more sense coming from a warped perspective in the heat of the moment.. . The question then is what exactly could’ve put Basil in the state of mind like the child in this example. For starters, we know the trauma of the accident would’ve left them both very shaken and irrational; we see the irrationality on display in Sunny dragging Mari’s body back to bed like everything would be okay. So that alone suggests they’re susceptible to taking extreme measures to resolve their problems at the moment.. . Basil’s motive is also firmly established: he wanted to protect Sunny *at all costs*. We see how he grew particularly attached to Sunny in the past, two introverts growing closer in a friend group of extroverts. His protectiveness took on a zealous fervor when it became apparent that his best friend was in grave danger. Whether they recognized the legal danger involved or it was more about protecting Sunny’s reputation with his family or friends is unknown, and probably doesn’t matter; in the end it led Basil to one conclusion: it had to look like Mari did it herself.. . After all, essentially telling the truth from that point (returning her body to the bottom of the stairs, but telling people she fell) would not only be a freak enough of an accident to warrant more scrutiny, it wouldn’t preclude Sunny’s involvement. A struggle that led to her falling is a hell of a lot more plausible than an apparent suicide actually being a manslaughter-coverup. **The only way to totally remove Sunny from scrutiny is to make it look like Mari did it herself and wanted to**.. . Now the question would be why Basil opted to stage a hanging. Lots of little things could’ve contributed to this choice. One is that Basil could’ve recognized from what he saw or what Sunny told him of the circumstances that Mari had a broken neck. “Suicide that leads to only a broken neck” pretty much only fits a hanging. There’s also a question of what potential alternatives he had. I’m loathe to do a breakdown of other common suicide methods, so let’s just say that most other methods that might occur to a preteen are messier, wouldn’t account for the broken neck, and are more likely to appear obviously faked.. . One other thing that occurred to me relevant to this is that it’s curious Basil knew how to tie a functional noose at 12. It’s not like he was a Boy Scout or anything. The implication here is that he might’ve had some personal experience with suicidal ideation by that point. Granted, big supposition on my part since he’s mostly portrayed as happy in what we see of the past, but that’s also always from Sunny’s perspective, never what’s happening behind closed doors...if this is true, it would also be a major influence in why Basil opted to stage a hanging.. . Also, they couldn’t say she was practicing violin because she wasn’t a violin player - she was a piano player. The possible presence of violin shards at the stairs could have also contributed to their wariness about just leaving that as the apparent crime scene if they were to say she just fell on her own.. . So, yeah, that’s about it. Essentially: Basil’s sole goal was to ensure Sunny’s safety. He took his duty to the extreme and chose to remove any reasonable suspicion of Sunny’s involvement by making it seem like Mari was the only responsible party. His shaken state of mind made him jump to that extreme instead of just going the more honest route and saying she fell down the stairs, which as I note would’ve been a spottier story than the hanging. (This response ended up being as belabored as the OP, lol, but I guess I had a lot of thoughts on this apparent plot inconsistency too.)
Fair points all around.. . I feel like this is just one of those times where a twist makes you go one of two ways.. . Either: “Aww, no!” A feeling of being enraptured by the story and the journey thus far to get to the sudden twist that ties it all together. . Or: “How?” Asking questions because the event is too far fetched to believe in that moment.. . It’s with those in the second scenario that Omori’s impact is lost. I’ve been told by a friend that I’m taking the game too seriously and trying to hold it to too much real life scrutiny. Not sure if I’m missing the point, but I feel like I shouldn’t have to try to jump through so many mental gymnastics to arrive at the same point others are.
Another point that popped up for me is, you can't explain the reason why Sunny's dad cut down the tree, without having to mention Mari's hanging. If they knew she didn't die by hanging then why cut down the tree?
Late, but the visual or her being hung there would be enough to loath the tree imo.
This game is so well written, it's mind boggling.
Wow thank you for this, you really put it down clearly! It makes a lot of sense
Me, who thought he would never play the game so spoiled himself anyways: “interesting.”
Wait where do you see the mom say that? The:  "My only daughter... is gone.
Wow! With the structure, flow, and argumentation of this post, I felt like I was reading a draft to a full analytical essay on Sunny's guilt manifesting and warping his psyche l!
ay yknow its cool seeing posts like this that go in depth with theories!
Thank you so so much for this well-written, complete analysis !! :)
damn, it feels wrong that this is 2 years old already
It could mean a few things. . * a child died who lived in the home. * someone who lives there is part of a designated gang. * Sunny's mom sells drugs from home because she needs the extra cash for being a single mom. * Kel
>!"Play the violin right this time, SUNNY."!<
 how did you get your shoes up there!?. .  catch went wrong. .  why were you playing catch with shoes!?. .  I lost my ball!. .  ...how'd you lose it. .  catch went wrong
who says it can't be all of the above 
Sunny's mom joined a gang to sell drugs after her husband left home because his daughter died.. . Kel buys the drugs.. . The drugs are just extra-potent Orange Joe.
I think my brother explained to me the shoes on the powerlines are for a drug place, or a place where someone killed their self so.
>!hanging sis huh...thats dark!<
>!No one can know the truth..!<
 you come into my house on the day my sister died, and you ask me for $20?
Where I'm from, this simply means ppl bullied someone and launched their shoes on the power line to piss them off 
I’m pretty sure that’s true for most of the world and people just make up myths about it. People always said it was a way to show you sell drugs around here but that’s 100% made up lol someone just threw shoes on a line to be a douche
Same
sunnys real name is tony
no its Dean
Dean Snuts
XD
𝐚𝐲𝐨 𝐩𝐢𝐳𝐳𝐚 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞
Wow, SUNNY *really*  hasn't learned from >!last time!<, did he?
where i’m from it just means hehe i put my shoes on the power line haha
We would do it to our old shoes we grew out of or to our friends as a joke.
Where I'm from, this means someone graduated
>!graduated to the afterlife!< 
Here means they are selling drugs.
Sunnys mom is a mafia boss
>!Fuck it, this is my new headcanon for why the police would seemingly overlook the bizarre circumstances surrounding Mari’s death. Sunny’s full name is Sunny Corleone.!<
What about SUNNY CADAVERINI?
huh, maybe that’s the real reason sunnys mom was away; she was threatening loan sharks with hospital bills and her claim about buying new furniture was a coverup
Probably trying to >!get therapy for herself and SUNNY!<
ok I’m dum, ignore my last comment, but did ya not get the reference 
I got it :P
This is how mafia works
Your existence fuels my hatred.
I was banned, it was miserable having like 7 unchecked comments
from where im from shoes on powerlines can mean that someone has committed suicide
That is strange never heard of that before. . where are you from?
from poland but im also kinda from a small city it might be only in the city and well im obviously not gonna say the citys name
Damn that’s interesting hahaha!. . Guess you learn something new everyday thx for info lol
no that just marks where you can get some weed. that means sunny had a prime spot for weed right outside his house and still didn't leave for 4 years to get some
Sunny gets his first edible 
Funniest shit I've seen in the Omori fandom so far, other than water
What I’ve been told is that it just means someone died before graduation. Sooooooo……

shoes on power lines also mean somebody has went to college. . >Many cultural variations exist and differences abound between socioeconomic areas and age groups. In some cultures, shoes are flung as part of a rite of passage, like to commemorate the end of a school year or a forthcoming marriage.. . as [somewhat alluded to by wikipedia](), since a rite of passage is a large step in somebody's life, and going to college is a big deal.. . 

I always thought that just meant someone who lives there graduated but apparently it means someone who lived there graduated from life.
that's a possibility, [shoe tossing can also be a rite of passage!]()
Where I'm from, this just means some kids just threw shoes to the powerline. That's it.
>!well shoes also mean that someone died!<
According to my dad who grew up in the lower east side of NY it usually means someone that wore those sneakers in that neighborhood passed away.  The drug thing was just a connection on many young men getting killed, so often it was intertwined.
FIGHTING GOOOOOOLD
Isn't a sign for a place where drugs are sold?
could've belonged to someone who died
Wow, interesting, I didn't know that, thanks for sharing
In my city kids just did that to be assholes lmao. . Once I saw a guy trying to get the shoes down with a stick😭
I always thought it was a prank we pulled on each other when someone left their shoes unattended. Never knew it had any sort of sinister implications lol.
I, Sunny Suzuki, have a dream...
i've looked into this before. . . possible meanings:. . rite of passage. . bullying. . gang turf. . (most interesting) dead gang member. . &#x200B;. . a 2015 study in Chicago rejected the possibility that it could mark a spot for drug deals btw
its gonna take a long time to get used to so many comments on my posts
Just a 90's reference.
 Where I’m from even it being a rough area kids just use to throw their old sneakers up there without a real reason but to be like “hey that’s my sneakers up there”. But every hood is different so it could have meaning other places
where im from it means a kid died😭
I mean, >!Mari actually was killed by Sunny SO!<
It’s ‘cause Basil obviously has weed and helped clear up her death. Sunny is innocent, as 99% of the time
>!Basil hung them there to remind sunny of his sins!<
I ain't heard crap about it being from gangs in fact I ain't even heard anything, I'm from British Columbia they used to be everywhere but not anymore,. . what do they actually mean?
Where I’m from it was an indication that someone lost their virginity there
Mafia AU??
sunny runs a fascist operation
real

it just meant that kids threw away an old pair of shoes in my area. lot of shoes tossed up
I saw those in game but I didn't know thier was a deeper meaning to it turns out sunny and basil were cooking something other then lies
so there are a couple good ideas as to what this could mean, but Id like to suggest that since this game's theme is based around mental health, it could have something to do relating to the [stamp out stigma]() movement. One of the several ways people have shown their support for it is by tying shoes and throwing the up in trees, structures, or power lines. I may be over thinking it, and I cannot come up with any canonical reason the shoes would be there, I just think it may be a nod to the movement and its history.
I once saw shoes like that and wondered what it meant.. . Please tell me you don't live in Washington
no i dont live in Washington but i think in washington it means a drug dealer is near.
Hm.. . I don't think I'll be telling my family that little factoid. Also, I'm really glad we moved when we did.
the secret train ending of omori where sunny gets arrested for slicing a train in half
Soon enough it will be black short hair skinny guy = Sunny whitch are most protagonists in anime
Welp than that means two thigs. One probebly sunny got so many girls. Two sunny has seen alot
The bridge is Newton's Law (F = m × a). We plugged Sunny's mass in and got a normal force. This proves dream gravity follows a real rule The bridge is the definition of a manifold ('looks flat up close'). The game's tile grid fits this definition perfectly.
Yeah, the normal force which you derived from the assumed gravitational acceleration and the supposed value of Omori’s mass (for statement 1). Yet we see no such indication within the game that the normal force is that value. So I don’t see how that proves anything. As for the 2D manifold issue, I believe the layman can clearly observe that it is a 2D space.
For omori's mass please look AT THE REFERENCE
As for the 2D issue I'd like u to try one thing, go to white space and move to î axis and then you will realise you came out from -î axis
He could have also grown out of flower crowns, but I see that as unlike as neither him or sunny have really grown much since... The recital
Sunny's not wrong
“SUNNY THIS IS THE 15TH TIME THIS MONTH JUST CONFESS TO ME ALREADY!”
There is a fic about this. It is called [Losing my mind]().
11 days later, I finally finished, and I have no regrets. I spent 30 minutes finding this comment again so I can tell you how glad I am that you shared this. TYSM <3
Thanks. I agree that it is a great fic.
It hits me right in the feels :(
I LIKE THIS, FOR ME THIS IS CANON, YOU CAN'T CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT IT.
The last image was funny
Great art but that's definitely not the reaction to that information

**IT HIT RIGHT IN THE HEART!**  . this is wholesome but sad at the same time
Well, wouldn’t you also choose the peaceful option when he BEAT THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF HIS TRUAMA DEMON WITH A VIOLEN.
It's a neat concept.
that last slide is beautiful
Depressing... ❤️
I really don’t get the last one
Poor Sunny  Nice comic! 
Theres actually a fanfiction very similar to this called "Stuck in Paradise", it's kinda long but I liked it when I read it 
You cant just say that and run without giving us that good and old **S A U C E**?
I’m so sunny
(Can't remember the lore well, so please kick me in the teeth if this contradicts anything.). . New theory - yes, the HeadSpace friends are remade when they become toast. It's a temporary state of being, as the defeated version is cast down to Black Space, and a new version is quickly made to take their place when they're "revived". Why are they sent off to Black Space, instead of just being resurrected? Well, would you rather keep trying to fix a broken part of a machine, or just get a new part? If the HeadSpace versions of Sunny's friends are insufficient enough in a battle, OMORI sees no reason in keeping them around.
In breaven, the party is turned into toast and Omori brings them back, and they thank him, telling him they were toast.
Aim for the molars.
Nah, I'm going for the wisdom teeth
&#x200B;. . 
i think at this point in the timeline sunny is stressed out about the recital so him retreating into himself like this (in a white space-y way) definitely makes sense
Yeah, fair point.
I thought this was way before he even got his violin.
the first photo in the album is sunny getting his violin, so everything else had to be after. (the photos are in chronological order)
maybe not an intended reference to whitespace but since omori and sunny are the same person it just makes sense that they'll show similar behaviour
Yeah if you look at the end Sunny retreats to white space after sitting Mari on the bed and basically creates OMORI because of that. Sunny was the one to create white space I think.
slightly off topic, but man, sunny is really cute in these photos.
HE IS THOOOO
Imo it definitely is. It's the first thing I thought when I saw the photo. And it's the first thing that made me realise that headspace didn't exist and was Sunny's shelter from reality.
10/10 gif with an accurate depiction of Snuuy
. . Ikr!
Yes my friend. I know that you know and now you know that I know you know so we can know together

This is by far the best fannon. Its a jarring gut punch to Sunny at first, but it significantly makes it easier for him to recover with his friends already there to support him. It resolves a bunch of the plot holes surrounding and tension around the discovery by revealing that Sunny and Basil were deluded in thinking that people wouldn’t figure out what happened. Finally, it undercuts the antagonist’s claim that no one can forgive Sunny by showing him he’s the only one in his life who hasn’t forgiven himself. It resolves the central conflict of Omori in a bittersweet way that leaves no uncertainty that Sunny will overcome his trauma with his friends.. . Honestly we were robbed a cutscene sequence between “I have something to tell you” and the secret ending with Basil. With out that cutscene, the audience is left at the highest point of tension, and can understandably spin off into a dark ending just as easily as a good one.
Mid-sentence, Sunny realizes that he still hasn't waken up yet. Suddenly, all his friends turn into Omori.. .  () : "You loved her and you killed her.". .  () : "You loved her and you killed her.". .  () : "You loved her and you killed her.". .  () : "You loved her and you killed her."
pain
() : "you loved her and you killed her."
 : you know what they say, all toasters, toast toast
(): "You loved her and you killed her."
REDDIT?!?1. . &#x200B;. . (![gif](emote|freeemotespack|snoo)): ”You loved her and you killed her.”
: I loved her and I killed her? Killed who?
: You know what you did, Sunny.
:Did what? What did I do? Where am I?
*(Omori has left. For now, anyways.)*. . *(Then, Sunny wakes up.)*
I think Hero is the most mature, so he knows how Mari would feel about it. That would be his first thought: that Mari loved Sunny and would never hate him for what he did. And he knows how much Sunny loved Mari too. He would be the first to think past his own feelings. Kel would need time to figure things out and Aubrey might hate Sunny at first, but Hero would forgive Sunny and Basil, probably on the spot.
I fully agree with you on Hero, but not with Aubrey or Kel. While I don’t think Aubrey would forgive Sunny *immediately*, she’d be an absolute hypocrite to hold a grudge forever, considering she spent the last 4 years being an asshole. It would render her entire redemption arc pointless if she never forgives him. That being said, I don’t expect her to forgive them on the spot. I’d give her a few months at minimum before she fully forgives them for what they’ve done.. . . And Kel, while yes, he wouldn’t just go, “it’s alright, I forgive you!” After learning the truth, saying he wouldn’t forgive Sunny and Basil doesn’t fall under his character at all. Sure, he’d probably be angry at them, but he’d more than likely still want to be around them. Mari’s death had the least impact on him in comparison to the other 4 in the friend group, so he has far less reason as to why he shouldn’t forgive them after he tells the truth.. . I honestly think that Hero is the only one that would forgive Sunny immediately(or at least within the first few hours after the truth is revealed), as that’s just in his nature. But I don’t see any of the gang *never* forgiving Sunny and Basil. Not only does it feel like needless angst, but it literally goes against the entire end sequence of the game about having trust in your friends. I don’t agree with either “everyone instantly forgives Sunny” or “no one forgives Sunny” headcanons, because they both feel pretty contradictory to what the game tries to tell you.

: you what.. . : damnit sunny right when I was going to ask you out. . : hey can we talk for a bit by those stairs
What goes around comes around
Really again that subjet, Sunny?... we knew that long time ago. . &#x200B;. . Sorry i forgot that... my bad.
I omor 
Ok, so here are my headcanons:. . Kel would be shocked. However, once the initial impact of the truth goes away, he'll almost definetely be the first to forgive Sunny. I mean, this is Kel we're talking about, he's the very definition of optimism. To say Kel wouldn't forgive Sunny would be like saying the Sun isn't going to be hot tomorrow.. . &#x200B;. . Aubrey would be a bit more of a tough case. Mari was a massive inspiration to her, and she saw her as the ideal older sister role model. When she had that stripped away, and Sunny shut himself off for four years, she had no one to fall back onto, and so she took it out on the world. To learn that Sunny was the cause of all her suffering could cause her to initially want to hit him as hard as she can, but she'll probably realize that after all the harm she's done in the past 4 years, she's not in any position to go after Sunny. I think that by the time Sunny gets dismissed from the hospital, she'll have forgiven Sunny.. . &#x200B;. . And as for Hero... he'd forgive Sunny. I don't know why this entire fandom is so stuck on the idea that Hero would hate Sunny or never forgive him after the good ending, as while it makes for admittedly good angst fanfics, it doesn't feel very true to his character whatsoever. This is *Hero*, after all. He's a big brother to the friend group, and he's not going to hate Sunny for an *accident* that left him just as damaged as Hero. Hero would be struggling after the good ending, for sure, but while it might take him a while, Hero will forgive Sunny. He's a good person stuck in an awful situation, and he's not gonna abandon Sunny for being brave enough to tell the truth after 4 long years. Honestly, where does all of this, "Hero will never forgive Sunny" nonsense come from? It honestly feels like people see his only personality trait as being the boyfriend to Mari and big brother to Kel.. . &#x200B;. . Anyways, those are just my thoughts, feel free to reply for elaboration.
Kel would forgive sunny sooner than most.. . Aubrey would take longer but eventually forgive sunny. Hell she almost killed basil by pushing him into water out of anger. . Hero I feel as if he would never forgive sunny. He would be able to still hang out and be friends, but wont be able to truthfully forgive sunny.. . . Put basil in a blender
Interesting. I don't see hero forgiving sunny but I can see kel not forgiving sunny first
: actually understood that it was an accident and tried to make sunny better.. . :stood in the same place 5 minutes then beat the shit outta sunny.. . 
: Oh yeah, it wasn't my fault. I no longer have to think about my dead gf. Get ready bitches, The Hero is back (proceeds to dance like bully maguire). . : Oh, anyway, Kim is a better friend than her. . : What the fuck Sunny?!, it was your sister, how could you? How could you lie to us for four years? because of you my brother was depressed for a year, I thought you were my best friend, kys, see you in hell.. . : This is unexpected, but...KEL, NO, NOT MY SUNTAN, YOU TWO WERE MY FAVORITE SHIP, PLEASE COME BACK FOR THE SNUUY. . (proceeds to oyasumi but falls on some cactus and survives)
What the-
Kel would probably forgive after like a day. . I don’t like Aubrey and Hero’s chances of forgiveness if I’m being honest. . . They’ll still be friends I think? They’d definitely have limited contact since Sunny moved and I presume it’s the 90s-2000s so cellphones won’t be as good as today. I don’t think either Sunny or Aubrey and Hero will want to talk to each other for a while though.. . They might forgive Sunny SOME day, when they all move on with their lives but right after the confession? The chances are slim.
 Sad but realizes she had made mistakes in those four years and will eventually get over it, and become friends with Sunny again. .  Sad for a few seconds, but smiles because he learns he wasn’t the reason >!Mari died!< and consoles Sunny that he did the right thing.. .  Nae nae before you get a whooping. . But seriously, Kel might be mad that the whole reason their friend group fell apart was because the truth wasn’t told, and he might feel anger at those moments at Sunny, but Aubrey and Hero will hold him back. He’ll eventually forgive Sunny.
i saw some animation or comic or something and i’ve never been able to not see this happening, i imagine hero walking over to sunny all blankly and everyone thinks he’s going to hurt sunny but he just leans down and hugs sunny and cries and says something like “how could you keep that in and not tell us you dealt with that all by yourself for years” it made me cry (especially being a sunny kinnie who is awful at handling guilt, i imagine kel also coming in and hugging sunny idk about aubrey though, i think she would need time but hero and kel would talk to her and she would forgive him
An original headcanon and theory that I have: all three of them already know, since the beginning. Sunny and Basil  have no idea they know though. Many in the comments said that as a joke but I legit think it's a possibility:. . Think about it, to me there's no way the police and the  investigators didn't find out about the made up suicide. I think Mari was bleeding, too. A coroner probably would have detected the murder.. . And look at Aubrey, I don't see how any sweet child like her could turn into a ruthless bully and tyran, if there wasn't a gruesome backstory behind it.. . Kel probably was sad, but eventually coped and that's why he tried to forget about it and went to see Sunny in order to get a fresh start in their relations, as if nothing happened. . . Hero was probably very angry, but being Kel's brother, he most likely followed his steps and forgave Sunny. . What about his mom? I don't think she disowned Sunny for this, she knew he would have never done this on purpose. He was a kid.. . As for Basil? Well I'm not documented enough about his parents but it could explained why they left and privileged work over their child.. . . Feel free to debunk my theory though if you feel like it, I haven't played OMORI a lot since my first playthrough 🥲
I believe all of them will require time, but definitely won’t abandon sunny as long as he gives them proper context.. . It would obviously hit hero hard to know what happened, but it would also be a weight off his chest knowing that he wasn’t responsible. I for one don’t think he would get mad at sunny, after what happened when he got mad with kel.. . Aubrey is complicated, because she is known to be hypocritical, but also compassionate at times. It’s likely for her to lash out and cut herself off from sunny, but it’s just as likely she forgives him on the spot. Once she puts her own actions in perspective, and how they’re similar to Sunny’s, she’ll forgive him. It’s just a matter of when that realization happens.. . Kel would forgive sunny.. . As for what they think of basil, that is a lot less straightforward; he is much more in the wrong, after all. I wouldn’t be surprised if basil needed to get professional help after the things he’s done (and been through).
Okay, this is gonna be long and of course it's all theoretical.  I think that all of them would need time to process except Aubrey who would react in anger right away. Dealing with a suicide of a loved one is very difficult and people can be confused and angry. It can feel like a betrayal. At least this is what I experienced after my mom did so. After four years I think it seems that a lot of them have mostly healed from it and are starting to try to move on with the exception of Aubrey who has only just done so in a healthy way. (Not including Sunny and Basil) To find out that it was actually an accidental death and then set up to look like Mari had done it to herself would be like whiplash. I think that Hero would be the first to forgive because he is so level headed and loved Mari so much. He would definitely try to think of what she would want and I think she would want Sunny to be forgiven. Hero may feel more responsible now to act as the older sibling because Sunny doesn't have one anymore. Also I believe that he may take a sense of comfort somewhere in the future knowing that Mari didn't make an active choice to leave all of her loved ones behind. I thin that somewhere in there even though he is trying to carryout what Mari would want he may still feel a sense of resentment towards Sunny that will take a long while to overcome. For Aubrey, she would probably be extremely angry and hurt. I could see her being more angry with Basil than she would be at Sunny because she has already directed her anger towards him. With Sunny he has accidentally committed a terrible act towards a loved one and his mind is all over the place and he doesn't know what to do. He tried to bring her to bed and let her wake up. I could see her thinking that Basil should have been the voice of reason for someone who has just lost a sibling by their own hands. When a mind is frantic and scrambling for what to do sometimes all we need is for someone to push us in the right direction. Basil was unable to do that and knew the truth all along and still spoke and hung out with Aubrey for a bit. So yes, I could see her not speaking to Sunny (perhaps ever again) but harboring anger towards Basil. Kel is the most difficult for me. I'm not quite sure what his reaction would be. He always tried to be there for Sunny. I think he would feel betrayed and confused. I believe it could shatter his happy go lucky attitude knowing that after all of that time Sunny and Basil hid the truth. I'm looking at the situation realistically and am unsure that a group friendship could withstand that. At the very least, I don't think things would ever be able to be the same again. After all, a huge part of the group is missing now. Mari was a safe space and a glue that held them together. I would like to think with time they could remember the times they had together fondly again.
To be fair, it's a great read, but how Sunny is shown to internalize the trauma does make him more suspect, so it's not that much of a reach.
How? How she know sunny is a factor? Ask her how she understand
To quote from her “why would sunny hallucinate about his dead sister as a monster, that paired with sunny and basil being the only two that see the ‘something’ makes me suspicious of sunny”
Woooow she is amazing
She's aware of Sunny having a part in it.... . That's a bit more than "a bit", huh?
I think this might be an intentional parallel. It makes it difficult to be so mad with sunny when something exactly like this happens right in front of us beforehand. They both lash out in an almost identical way, but the only difference is that one ended tragically and the other was only a close call. I think that in the ending this would be why Aubrey would forgive Sunny. She did the exact same thing literally a couple days before. To judge him is hypocritical, even if he did something horrible.
She better forgive me or ill need to make her remember that over and over again and i dont want to do that because i know that she will get sad
Eeeemmm Sunny i think that is a bit ruthless, but yes she have to.
I know thats ruthless and thats why ı dont want to do that i mean i really love her after all
Yeah you right Sunny
Well, except for the part where she and a friend faked a suicide and hid it for years. But yes, there is a parallel.
That was entirely basil though Sunny was too traumatised to do anything.
Intentional parallel to make you feel like a hypocrite for thinking sunny is a fucking murderer
Tne one I really enjoyed was tree mini boss at the start of the game. You gotta make sunny sad then use the move stab, cuz you know \~the tree holds bad memories
Go on with your life Sunny
So looking into it further its probably reused from [the real world tv about recycling](), however the sound of it is just *different.*. . It also plays Sunny's violin motif at the end as well.. . [
I suppose I should've stated Omori not Sunny, I consider them the same entity. Omori possessing and asserting full control would make sense since Omori just wants to kill.
Late but I dont see that either. Omori's main goal is to protect Sunny while also concealing the truth of what happened while also being a representation of Sunny's anxieties/depression. Omori may at most have interest in killing Basil since he was directly involved, but not much else. Killing Sunny's friends would do more bad than good.
You mean him going further into a depressive state only to take it out on everyone else seems unrealistic? I don't. I mean by virtue of going for the omori route you're already isolating yourself. That idea of isolating yourself and further feeding that depression could end up making Omori stronger and merging with Sunny completely.. . You could represent it by going further and further into dark space, game already does a good job of that by giving you abilities unique to Omori.
Omori isn't some axe murderer. He's a sword of damocles pointed at himself.
Not gonna lie, the last two sentences made me tear up a bit
Oh man same...
Relatable
Yeah, I feel like the intended interpretation is that is friends (eventually) forgive him. It would have been cheap to just tack it on at the end explicitly since that forgiveness is going to be a whole process, giving us the ending we got.
>After all of the interactive story elements the game gave us, it's asking one final thing from us. It's asking us to put our trust in Hero, Kel, and Aubrey to forgive Sunny, just like he has to.. . I just thought that the vague ending was to allow us as players to leave it up to our own interpretations (and it still is to an extent), but.. man, that's so clever.
What a beautiful post, it really made me think about why Sunny’s friends would forgive him. Thank you for sharing your articulated thoughts! I finally have a reason to believe why Sunny and Basil would eventually be forgiven
Damn, that's cool
The last two sentences was all i needed to delete the trauma.
That was beautiful
Theres a lot of meme and discussion about this too. Most people think that the gang( Hero, Kel, and Aubrey) will be pissed and hold resentment toward Sunny. In that, Hero will be the one who would hold most resentment and Aubrey will be the quickest to forgive Sunny (because this happened with her before). This stem from the fact that this is the Real world and in the real world, people don't forgive others so easily. Hell when I know the truth, Im not sure if I can forgive him that easily.. . However, most people would agree that given enough time, Sunny will be forgiven. There will be struggle and Sunny and Basil will suffer more, but atleast they are ready for it, and thats what matter the most.
Brilliantly said 👍
I had the same feeling! I feel like the game wouldn’t put quotes like “last time, we made the mistake of leaving each other when we needed each other the most.” And “friends, friends are supposed to be there for each other.” And I might be trying to deny my depression away but I really hope sunny doesn’t go through more shit
I'd say that if you look deep enough in the real world, you will only find evidence pointing to the friends eventually forgiving ##.. . Kel has been asking for Sunny to come out for months, Aubrey had the same experience, minus the consequences. Hero couldn't forgive himself for not seeing nonexistent signs, and also knows what it is to blow up at a sibling.
Yeah, it doesn’t make narrative sense for them not to.
Damn those last couple sentences hit different holy shit
Wow. Firstly I have only watched livestreams of this game and have not played it for myself (because what is money) but Omori possibly has one of my favourite stories in a video game.
well shit man this was a brilliant read, excellently done
Those were true words you’ve spoken!
My reason is that any of them not forgiving him just seems completely nonsensical whichever way I think about it
That doesn’t prove they are forgiven. They could still be calm and happy even if their friends didn’t forgive them knowing that they overcame their trauma and revealing the truth. It would be like a massive weight was lifted of their shoulders. They can still be happy even if they weren’t forgiven there.
To show that basil and sunny are happy again. They just recovered from the worst part of their lives of course they’ll still be happy even if they aren’t forgiven in the hospital. I agree that they would probably be forgiven given enough time but it’s way too hopeful to think that they were both completely forgiven that quickly.
Like I said I think they would all forgive him given  enough time. It’s still possible for them to be happy at them point even without complete forgiveness. In the cutscene basil just woke up he would have still been knocked out and unable to hear if they forgave him or not and he was still happy. The others just now found out sunny and basil we’re keeping the truth from them for 4 years at this point with all of them still believing it was a suicide and not knowing why she would do it and the sunny just now says it was staged. They would probably forgive him eventually but it is unrealistic for them to forgive him right there , right then in the hospital.
Wait what
I dont think thats the one. I think the reason they are calm because they forgave them self. But also they trust their friends too.
The point is to show that they are now ready to tell the truth, and have forgive themself.. Ofcourse every body have different interpretation. Thats just my opinion :))
Sunny ignored basil along with everybody else for 4yrs. His 'bestfriend'.  Basil was prolly scared shitless sunny hated him. Them forgiving each other and being finally ready to tell the others, come what may, would make a lot of sense for it happening beforehand. In my mind anyway.
Hmm. Good point. I hadnt considered that.
Heavy Spoilers ahead obviously for those who haven't finished the game.. . Not necessarily. The secret ending just shows that Sunny and Basil have dealt with the brunt of their guilt and shame that prevented them from facing reality. It's still up to the player as to whether or not they think the rest of the cast would forgive them.. . My interpretation is that Kel would likely immediately forgive them given that he's already dealt with Maris death and takes change on the chin.. . Hero would likely need some time and as the levelheaded adult would likely be more critical about the way in which they carried out the act. But the truth would give him the closure he desperately needed and allow him to stop blaming himself so I'm pretty sure he would forgive Sunny and Basil in time.. . Aubrey is the real 50/50 I can't pin down. Like Hero she would definitely need a lot of time and thought but she also never really blamed herself for it happening. She also isn't very level-headed and has shown she can hold grudges for years. She is the most sympathetic to Sunny's struggles though so maybe she'll understand. I highly doubt she would forgive Basil assuming Sunny doesn't frame it as all as his own act with Basil merely helping. To be clear, Sunny may have killed Mari accidentally but Basil was the one who suggested framing it as a suicide and encouraged the devastated Sunny to help carry it out that way.
There's also the fact that Aubrey nearly killed Basil, by pushing him into the lake similar to what Sunny did with Mari and she was much older so I think that's a very intentional parallel.
You know I recently keep asking about the forgiveness up this game and. . I even asked that:. . **Will forgiveness is the potent point of this game ?**. . . And everyone pick yes so the majority will even agree with your theory.. . ***I Have thought every last reason for the gang to forgive both Sunny and Basil from the most logical point to mental heath.*** ( so there are no reason not to forgive them at all ). . Because the worst part is not only no forgiveness but is also about loneliness and just depressed make the game is the same with almost every horror game out there.. . So yes I trust them and that make the fandom more awesome no toxic
Thank you for putting this into qords. . Truly a fantastic way to explain it. . And i completely agree 👍 . . This game changed my life a little bit... . It hurts to to put into words how
Finally I can sleep peacefully and move on past this game also if anyone says otherwise you are objectively wrong
Sunny's
sunny is high on meth the entire time. . (methaphore)
i am just joking . also i can see truth in your theory especially how it's stuck to the seeling and other stuff being there to "decrease" Sunny's pain . i can see omori choosing this (considering he choosed to suicide when he was in control)
Yeah that's also a possibility.
Wait! I like this! approved!

Sunny has 2 hands though
Omori plays the piano then?
I like this.
This is an absolutely amazing theory
Is this in the duet cutscene?
Yeah



Nice reference to if I remember the old concept of Omori boy, but that's just weird dude
Not really, if there was a second camera then it could have been the previous Halloween. And if you didn’t notice, Sunny also isn’t in these photos, meaning he could have taken the photos.
that wouldnt fit in with the current games timeline either thiugh cause the photo album didnt start til february thats what im trying to say.he is in the unused photos too. . 
my stupid ass was thinking that these were ships. Sunny and Mc as a couple would be goofy 🗣️📢🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think swapping Sunny and Hero would actually make more sense here.
Seems like Sunny was the one who made the game /j
Basil and Sunny are more like yuri
pretty solid theory
>!MONIKA FALLS DOWN THE FUCKING STAIRS????????!<
Why can't I see the comments?
The hell, your right
Mc-sunny. . Sayori- Mari . . Yuri- basil. . Natsuki- Aubrey . . Monica- omori
This is not anime tho?
Im pretty sure he was hallucinating since his mind was so fucked up
schizophrenia
oh, maybe! I was interpreting headspace as maladaptive daydreaming
Interesting thought, but its heavily shown that its him actually sleeping and dreaming.. Some instances show him hallucinating headspace stuff irl since he spends so much time dreaming, but otherwise he sees reality as is if hes not confronting his fears.
Headspace can certainly be interpreted that way yeah. The stuff in the real world is explicitly hallucinatory though. Speaking as someone with C-PTSD, yeah, sometimes flashbacks can manifest as quite vivid sensory intrusions of the memories making it seem like you're half present half there. What Sunny's experiencing most here relates to that in my mind, personally.
at its peak
Although your health is still reduced; the game even puts a first aid kit at the bottom of the stairs incase you fuck up Calm Down
I think it might just be an oversight and the free first aid kit is for when you go outside (if you decide to, that is). Another oversight is, if I’m remembering this correctly, >!Sunny having the lightbulb in his inventory in the time between waking up and going to fight Basil.!<
I mean I imagine that putting a healing item right after a fight that you can get hurt in would be intentional
The thing is you auto heal back to full when you wake up the next day regardless iirc and there’s no RW fights between acrophobia and waking up
honk mimimimi tho
?
In the same way that someone who is delirious will bump into things because they dont know quite where they are/whats around them, or swing at things that arent there because they think its there
I took everything we saw in headspace and some things in the real world with a grain of salt.. . Like we see the things more vividly than he does.. . For example, we can clearly see SOMETHING as a figure following us through the whole game, I interpet that, especially in the real world as more so a flash or sudden fear and panic, like a memory being triggered then going away or lingering for a moment. What we see isn't what Sunny sees but an interpretation that lets us feel exactly what he's feeling. I have no issue with the events being taken more literally, but this is how I think this game can feel closest to reality.. . . I'm pretty sure each SOMETHING fight (heights, spiders, and water) all are panic attacks. Think of the spider one where he sees spiders everywhere in the house, but once the delusion ends, it's just one small spider at the top of the staircase. So I don't think Sunny is ACTUALLY fighting the monster like it's visualized, but he's metaphorically fighting the fear and dread and truama caused by it, and it's only when he simply tries to calm down and let it pass does he come out of it, like an actual panic attack.. . So I think the visual of slicing here is more so him fighting against his fears and guilt rather than actually hurting himself or wanting to. The best thing about this stuff though as it's a valid thought process, and media like this gives you so much detail to look into. You can find everything.
I really like this interpretation!! the only reason I thought it was perhaps more literal is because I heard that in one ending, if you grab the steak knife before sleeping and stab yourself in white space, it manifests as stabbing yourself in the real world too. So I wondered if he was also stabbing a real thing in this scene
Something is his burden, personified. He defeats his fear, all in his head. The boss fights are metaphors for controlling his mind in those moments
He's just hallucinating and lashing out at them.
Sunny never actually has a knife during any of the three Something fights. He picks up a knife, but it's part of the hallucination. After each one he still only has "Hands" equipped. The only time he has a knife is from the time period after the first Something fight when he eats bad steak until Kel takes it away after the Aubrey fight in the park. You can also pick up another one if you go home instead of helping Basil at the sleepover, but that's after all three Something fights (and doesn't end well for our boy).
In my head canon he literally has a heart attack at this moment
You know what? That might be a very valid explanation, lol
I saw it as a metaphor, the hands are like inescapable fear and something is the physical form of that fear, so in the >!hikkiomori route, where you stay inside and get consumed by that fear you can use the red hands skill!< . . Basically the main part of the fear changes but the fact that hands are constant for everything shows how you are always afraid until you overcome the source of your fears
Whatever it is, SUNNY isn't safe within his own house and home.
Well in my interpretation he's just terrified of heights and since he's going through the stairs he feels like something's dragging him and could fall at any time. He's just hallucinating because he's traumatized because of stairs (if you finished the game you know it's for obvious reasons)
It was dark and he was not able to get down the star without tripping every couple steps due trauma and limited vision, so he was hallucinating that something down the stairs made of lot of arms is dragging him down to make him fall from the stairs exactly how someone fell from the stairs 4 years ago, so he freak out and start waving a knife at the imaginary hands (not sure if it is canon he was carrying the real knife at that moment or if he also was imagining that he was holding the steak knife while he was not) its similar to the microwave that magically worked while the house is having a blackout in the middle of the night and eats unwarmed cold and maybe uncooked steak imagining its fully warmed up steaming delicious steak, his stomach doesnt agree with the imagination and hallucinations and end up to yell at him "THROW THIS SHIT OUT OF ME"
Dolls, I think I cooked with my explaination, but if someone notice that I missed *something* or was mistaken somewhere correct me immediatly because I care about the accurate lore of omori and will always appreciate if someone points me to lore points and things I missed or misunderstood.
In his head- not only can you hallucinate visuals and sounds you also can trip so hard (usually via drugs or delirium) you think you also felt or did something when in reality something else was going on. 
No, it is more closer to trauma. It doesn't necessarily to equate to self harm (even this part is not about harming yourself). This part is more about when you have something deep inside back of your skull and you immediately face it for one time. You have chance either you lose it or you pull back.
Yeah no your theory makes no sense to me, sorry
This is sunny battling his fear of heights. the arms are emanating from the darkness at the bottom of the stairs, they represent gravity pulling him down. These arms also appear when standing near the really tall ladder in headspace. Similarly, legs represents his fear of spiders and hair represents his fear of drowning
i think it is just a simbolic thing about him fighting his fears and he is not just stabbing the dark or himself. I think he heals on his own as soon as the fight ends.
. . It seems to me that he didn't harm himself, but like an idiot in a boxing pose, he punched the air, thinking that he was fighting a phobia. I think this is the version of events.
Only Snuuy (and Omor) can hate Snuuy!
fax
:  I hate 
Snuuy in a nutshell:
: I 
Literally the first thing I said out loud upon seeing the reveal was “god damnit Sunny.” So based.
yea plus she already forgave sunny so idk why op thinks she “needs a minute” :/
She needs a minute to compose herself after "HOLY SHIT SUNNY IS ACCEPTING THE TRUTH AND TRYING TO MOVE ON YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. . Ahem, of course I forgive you, little brother!"
i would befriend snuuy in a heartbeat :’)
But that entire theme and message is based on the fake reality that Sunny's friends have been led to believe. The "incident" they know of and try to move on from isn't even real. The rekindling of their friendship in the last 3 days is based on this fabricated premise.. . I fail to see how the game was building up to the gang forgiving Sunny and Basil when they didn't even know the truth until the very last moment.
If the game was building up to a bleak ending, then it wouldn’t have gone so hard in showing the playable characters come together 100%. They literally rebuilt their friendship. The ending you think happens would be better portrayed if the characters were all apprehensive about getting back together, but did so in fear that Basil would harm himself/he deserved to get the photo album back/one last good bye to Sunny. . . Instead we get a game where they go all out in mending their relationship and doubles down with a bunch of cute scenes showing their chemistry still works. . . The game we got shows that when they stay together,  they can work it out. It’s gonna be difficult because no punches were pulled, but they’d eventually come to understand the immense guilt Sunny felt and how it broke him for 4 years.
I still disagree. Just because the game showed the characters rebuilding their friendship from the ground up, doesn't necessarily mean that the ending is going towards them all being happy and merry together. It works to show that the gang still care about each other and can mend things out, but like I said the motivation behind this is... fake. Yeah they can work it out, but what they are trying to work out never even happened.. . The entire point of the twist towards the end is to show that Sunny's friends have been led to believe a horrific lie. The twist works BECAUSE the game has shown how much the gang care for each other, that makes the lie so much worse. It enhances the image of the betrayal the gang would feel once Sunny reveals everything. I don't believe the alternate storyline you suggested would be effective for this reason. OMORI's story and characters aren't one-dimensional. Yes there's cute fluffy moments about friendship but there are also plenty of realistic scenes, the game does attempt to show realistic depictions of how people would react differently in the given situation.. . The bonds between the main cast is a strong theme for sure but when Sunny reveals the truth, is he not the one who's cast their bond aside for years? Whether he intended or not, regardless of the reason for hiding the truth, Sunny and Basil's choice caused their friends unnecessary damage and suffering. Heck from the gang's perspective, they were just getting back together, talking about how they would move on and always be there for one another, then Sunny just shows up and claims the whole reason they broke up was because of him. That definitely doesn't scream "friendship" to me.
But that’s what I mean, before Sunny faces off against Omori he even has that scene with the colored versions of his young friends and then his grown up friends. Right before the climax, but after we know the truth, the game goes out the way to remind us how good their friendship is.. . That would have been the prime moments to twist the knife, for us to see his friends berate him in his own mind. But that is simply not the message the game wants you to have going into the final boss. . . Ultimately this is an optimistic game, it’s going to be hard as hell but they can get through it. I’d be with you and the crowd that wants that gritty but more grounded ending if the game didn’t execute this the way it did. . . It makes a case for the entire game, and it’s pretty damn consistent about it. The only thing left is the final scene (which the true ending is a scene of Sunny having it in him to smile at Basil and vice versa after Sunny said the truth), but asides from that it consistently builds this messaging. The premise of their friendship was always tainted by the worst accident that could happen, and ultimately, as hard as it’s gonna be, that understanding is eventually going to get them through it.
Ehhhh... are the friends before the final battle even real? I've always interpreted that as what Sunny wants to believe his friends would say, since it still takes place in his mind. To me the things they say is what Sunny tells himself to build up he courage to confront Omori, rather than the actual thoughts of his friends.
They’re not real, but it’s not about that. If the game wanted to prime you for a bleak ending, at that point of the game right after you know the truth, it’s the storytellers final chance to twist the knife and plant the seeds of that ending. It would have been perfect too.. . By reinforcing their friendship right before the climax, it does the opposite. The alternate end would have Sunny doubt the strength of their bond only for him to pull off a last second win against Omori, but with the knowledge that his friends would leave him.. . Instead the entire final sequence is built upon your belief in your friends eclipsing Omoris self hatred and doubt. . . Basically the game never swerved towards the bleak ending even after you find the truth, in fact after you find the truth it never really plants any doubt in your mind in preparation for the final boss, you come in swinging on an emotional high (but what makes it so good is that even with the emotional high, Omori is still an impossibly tough enemy to take down). . . It feels hard to believe the game would take the any of the darkest outcomes because it just didn’t execute the story with that as the trajectory.. . It’s not about what’s real or realistic, it’s about the story that the writers told and the messaging behind it.
I think we just gotta agree to disagree. I just don't really see your points and I don't think you see mine.
I mean I see your points, you’re looking at it was the premise of friendship being warped, and I’m saying the messaging of the game never leads the player to believe that this would be an unrecoverable situation, in spite of that.. . There’s logic to what you’re saying, and the game could have easily told that story and it would have still worked and been great. I just don’t think that’s the story they focused on theme-wise.
Oh sorry I meant like, our points aren't really convincing each other. I also see your point and reasoning but I just don't agree.. . And honestly that's fine, part of what makes Omori so great is people can have differing depictions and opinions about the story, just as we have here.
>!Poor Hero, I think he'd actually be the first to forgive. He's the only one that's actually been through what Sunny's been through. Locking himself inside his house for a year would definitely be enough for him to tell that Sunny did *not* enjoy being away from everyone for 4 years. Especially with the guilt of killing Mari. Hero also feels like since he's the eldest of the group, he should take care of everyone and be the one to make things right (like when Aubrey pushed Basil in the lake), and he also promised to be there for everyone when they all needed it the most. I don't think he'd just say "lmao fuck that shit sunny can go jump off a hospital for all i care". If there's someone Hero wouldn't forgive, it'd be Basil. Hero was depressed because he didn't know why Mari killed herself. And he wanted to know why. If he knew Sunny pushed her down the stairs, his anger would be directed towards Sunny, but his depression would be a lot shorter.!<. . >!Something that somewhat bothers me is people saying that "Hero was the closest to Mari, so that's why he wouldn't forgive Sunny". If we're going by that logic, then Aubrey should be the one to not forgive Sunny, since Mari was like the mother she never had to her. Heck, if we go by the OMORI fight's logic, then everyone loved her equally. So would that mean no one would forgive him? Honestly, that's pretty fair. It's pretty surreal to think *everyone* would forgive Sunny. Sure, they *are* friends, but that doesn't mean Sunny gets away Scott free. If there's someone who wouldn't forgive, it'd be Kel. His world is simple, you're either a good guy, or a bad guy. Sunny would be a bad guy.!<. . >!Basil is a whole other can of worms, and I honestly don't know if they'd forgive him.!<. . but that's just a theory
SUNNY NO
The Snuuy  will never forgive Sunny for his crimes. 
Hey, so like both of you think his Headspace friends would forgive him? I mean Headspace is just a reflection of his mind, they love Omori because they do not know the truth. If they did, Sunny's mind would warp them to unrealistically hate and despise them I believe, just like Omori. Unless you're going with the "Headspace character have their own consciousness" theory. I think his Headspace friends would be the most hateful versions of the two, Sunny's guilt ridden mind could not accept the idea of his friends forgiving him, and Headspace would reflect that. The escapist fantasy breaks when they all know the truth, he can no longer imagine them ignorant of his sins.. . Just a theory though, share your thoughts?
they love omori no matter what he does, every skeleton you see in the game is a previous version of them and during the monologue after Humphrey it states they still seek  your love even after what you did. . and if you think about it headspace is a fantasy world of what sunny wants/thinks of his friends to be, Aubrey having a huge crush, kel being super childish, hero being loved by all and always having the answer to a problem . . so headspace would make them love and forgive sunny because that's what he wats most of all
Does he though? Does Sunny really want to be forgiven?  Does Sunny think he deserves it?
no, he doesn't think he deserves forgiveness . . but he would be over the moon happy if he was. . if you remember before the truth, dream basil tells sunny that "you need to believe that your friends would forgive you, there good friends" a false delusion he made himself believe to keep his sanity, of course he wants them to but he doesn't think it matters if they don't, he just wanted to tell the truth. . also during the good ending the dream friends can be seen trying to lead sunny to the balcony where he commits suicide, they lull him with a cheery smile and friendly jesters, just what sunny wants his friends to do, "be nice not make him commit suicide...just for clarification "
. . If this takes place after the Hikkikomori route, this comic I realise is much sadder in that context.
u/Moninka123 has become DEPRESSED.
It leaves a giant, gaping plothole in the form of >!Abbi!< though.
And horny as fuck
You gotta cope in the afterlife somehow
Huge spoiler for the hikikomori route but >!Sunny literally kills himself at the end.!<
I got the other Hikkikomori/Neutral ending where . >! Omori lives, Sunny dies metaphorically and he leaves his old home and real friends behind while Something haunts him for the rest of his days. !<. . So Omori Boy is what they would have become on this route.
Oh, your spoiler didn't work btw, might wanna edit.. . >!I didn't even know that there were multiple hiki endings lol, I just thought there was 1.!<
Just fixed it 😅
My HC now.
*Is this the real life*? Is this just fantasy? . . \- Omoriboy
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality!
>!no mate, hes fuckin dead!<
 ok
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|feelsbadman)THAT SOUNDS SO COOL
Achtuallyy 🤓, they have always been there, even in the Sunny route.
I thank you for the care of making a more interesting response. Anyway mine was just a joke referring to the last fight. Joke's aside i do can relate a bit on what Sunny felt. The finger around in BL was very triggering for me (even so i appreciated that detail). Futhermore with the expetetion from the others that makes you hate the instrument as a rejection. I interpreted the true ending to  sunny trying again to play violin in the future as he might recall about the good and bad feeling about it and like it once more.
Omori is just sunnys pianosona
And even then it's not even confirmed it's still there after the 4 year timeskip. It was clearly one-sided before and I think that Sunny held a grudge to that? >!In the Dream World he never reciprocates except for one time which was still very...Omori. And many of the enemies are bunnies which is Aubrey's pet of choice, is jut something to think but it may explain why there's no reaction from either of them!<. . So yeah basically there's the possibility that there's not even ONE current crush in the Real World since >!Mari died (sorry Hero), and Sunny's crush most likely has dissipated.!<. . Which is nice, since at least there won't be those annoying ship wars that every fandom has. And I think that the game doesn't need to think about romantic stuff when there's all the other stuff going on
Oh believe me it doesen't stop anyone from shipping and setting the sails.
The game kind of implies they both had a mutual crush when they were younger and might have some lingering feelings, but who knows
tbh any Sunny ship is plausible (except for Hero and Mari for OBVIOUS reasons).. . Sunny and Kel makes sense. . Sunny and Aubrey makes sense. . Sunny and Basil makes sense. . &#x200B;. . I think the game just left Sunny's current feelings very ambiguous.
Funny thing... before I ever played Omori, for years, I thought Sunny x Mari WAS canon. Apparently, the places I frequent posted lots of pics of it, to the point where I really thought that was a plot point of the game. Having just played it at last and finished this week, I see now how that one was WAY off.. . Just goes to show you, if it exists, SOMEONE will ship it.. . (I'm sure Sunny x Hero exists out there for the same reason too. I mean, who else would remind him more of Mari and make him feel still close to her, but Sunny himself?)
Wellp you know how this games work if sunny like someone it's probably gonna be canon
Adorable Aw :) I don’t know but I love the ship! I think Aubrey and sunny is cute and sunny and basil too actually
I think she might have had a crush on Sunny in childhood, but I can only imagine her current feelings mostly rooted in being worried about an old friend. I think it's possible they might get together or something, I just don't see Aubrey holding a flame for Sunny for 4 years without ever seeing him, especially after how much she changed.
Why does sunny have a gun? Is he American? 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸
* Sunny looking through the photo album after looking up the insect\*. .  "FUCK!"
He wouldn’t have to deliver pizzas and suffer all day 
It does for sure, and it's meant to haha. The whole point was Sunny finally having the courage to accept and tell the truth to his friends. We don't get to see them actually forgive him, because the story requires us to overcome the same fear that Sunny had to of risking his friends not doing so.. . Sunny didn't get to know what would happen next after his confession, so we get to feel the same way.
Noooooooooo
We're not talking about your post's sprite. We're talking about the end of the >!console-exclusive BOSS RUSH in the fight against MARI. OMORI changes into SUNNY at the end, but the person I'm addressing thinks it's still OMORI at the BOSS RUSH even though it changed to SUNNY!<
And Sunny = Kris 
sunny and kris both:. . have a neutral expression.. . go to a fantasy world and have adventures.. . stab themselves.
When does frisk stab himself
Sunny and Kris. . \- Both are quiet introverts. . \- Has access to a fantasy world. . \- Both play classical instruments. . \- Has a crush on a tough delinquent girl. . \- Is friends with a femboy. . \- Have older siblings they both look up to
What does kris play
They play the piano
Learned sonething
And kris doesn’t have a crush on susie noelle does
I think the last resort feels so out of place due to its location in the narrative. By the time you reach the last resort, Sunny is further getting closer to facing the truth and thus I think Omori compels new fantasies out of desperation regardless of if they flow from the last. When you find your friends they act as though they weren't even at Sweetheart's palace, and begin to forget Basil even exists. It's as though the fantastical world is beginning to unravel as Sunny continues to push forward, so thus the fantasies become more and more fantastical.
Wow, then I guess the last resort really is a last resort of sorts to keep the fantasy world intact
oh.. my god...
...this makes a *lot* of sense.
oooh, i love the idea of Last Resort being thematically linked to growing up. Getting a job would be a very 'adult' thing to a kid, and casinos must seem like a particularly 'adult' environment too.The idea of Last Resort being a metaphor for Sunny's desire for all his friends, who have drifted apart over the years, to pull back together one last time before he moves,  is super compelling too.  LR definitely seems to parallel the time spent in the real world in game-- even down to Sunny interacting with Kel first, Aubrey second, and Hero third, both in the real world 'collect-a-friend' quest and in the Last Resort 'collect-a-friend' quest.  Maybe Sunny subconsciously recognizes that the 3-day reunion effort is his last chance to save Basil and therefore is their "last resort" in that sense as well?  . . . (although TBF 'collect-a-friend' quest might be a generous way to phrase what happens in the real world... given that Kel just wants to hang out with Sunny before he leaves and isn't planning on reuniting everyone, heh)
ooh, no yeah that's a fair point. Headspace does seem to be all about suppressing the truth, so i can see how in that sense it does make more sense for Last Resort to be one last defense against Sunny getting closer to the truth.
Last resort comes from the shitty blackjack game on sunny's computer, the cards have sharks on the backs and their is contruction in the games background like in Last Resort.
I love all of these theories in the post and comments. . There's only one problems tho. . Hasn't it been said that Sunny just keeps dreaming the same loop over and over again and that in the game we manage to break the loop? So even if those metaphors were true, how would Sunny be able to know that early on before the final days?
> So even if those metaphors were true, how would Sunny be able to know that early on before the final days?. . There was a line of dialog towards the end that implied Sunny only very recently (like within the last year or so) stopped going to school. So he probably would've witnessed some of it firsthand.
As Flame says, yeah i think so too. . It's been mentioned that Sunny hasn't gotten out of his house in years possibly, so i think he stopped going to school a few months-a year after Mari's death
Could you elaborate more on this? I've never seen anything to suggest that.
IIRC It was Aubrey saying this, at the treehouse on the 3rd day - she mentioned that after Sunny stopped showing up to school she tried to hang out with Basil at his place and that's when she saw the vandalized pictures, took his album from him, and started bullying him. . . Given that on day one Kel and Sunny encounter him desperately trying to get Kim to help him get his album back I'm assuming that the theft was kinda recent (like within the last week / couple of months or so), and by extension Sunny's truancy as well. . . I might be reading into this a little too much though.
: I need that \[HEARTSHAPEDOBJECT\] for my divine pledge to \[50% off divorce papers\] Sunny! I must achieve \[KRISPY-KREME-LINK-BLOCKED\]
>!Well yeah that's because they were together when hanging Mari. I like to think that the reason they have a specific "something" is because of each other's POV. Like Basil sees something behind Sunny because he was leading Sunny out of the yard when he looked back and Sunny sees something behind himself because he also looked back. Sunny sees Basil's something probably from when Basil was trying to calm him down; considering Sunny was under a lot of stress his view was probably fuzzy. I know the game has fantastic elements and I believe that the fantasy happens in the game (like Sunny entering whitespace as Sunny or Mari's spirit playing the piano) but I know some people like seeing it in a more realistic context, I just like seeing different view points!<
People can have actual physical reactions to hallucinations and also psychological, that's why stuff like LSD can cause PTSD. And correct me if I'm wrong but whenever you >!fight something in the stairs at the end of each day, when you check your stats after the fight your hp is full so it supports it being a hallucination!<.. . Also it is true that it'd be weird if they shared a hallucination, but to be fair >!Sunny's something is something (lol) that Basil actually saw with his own eyes, so he could probably imagine the same something too. Also I don't think we ever leave Sunny's perspective of something outside of maybe the post credits scene in the good ending so Basil could just be seeing something completely different. That could be backed up by something showing up whenever Basil mentions it, which would trigger Sunny's trauma manifested as something again!<. . BTW just to clarify, I don't want to come off as trying to push my interpretations into you or anyone else, the beauty of art is that every interpretation is correct and I would never force you to change your mind. Your interpretation is really good and I just wanted to back up mine :). . Also if you ever feel comfortable with sharing your writing I'd love to take a look!
Some people guess Hero would be pissed at Sunny after the true ending, but I've always wondered if he would be relieved instead? It would probably be a huge weight off his chest to know that it wasn't his fault/why.
He could still be mad about it, but maybe instead of mad at the fact Sunny accidentally killed Mari, it's more about hiding the truth
My take is that Hero would be more mad at Basil than Sunny due to the whole "let's stage a suicide thing", also add the whole stabby stab on Sunny's eye on top of it and it definitely makes him easier to hate at the moment.
Hehe shears go stab
my headcanon is that Hero will forgive Sunny but not Basil(well not after a long time)
its a good theory really, it really fills in the plot hole and makes a lot of sense
When it comes to this game, reading too much into it is usually the correct approach
no yes they all absolutely blamed themselves
Hero like Sunny suffered a lot with the death of Mari.
Black Space has so much fucked up secrets.. . >!Red Space!< being probably the most significant of them. . . Really goes to show how fried Sunny's brain is.
What's so significant about red space? Isn't just the stumps and the something zoo?
It's also the origin of the Red Hands. . . It's where Omori is most powerful. . . It's where Omori goes after he kills Dream Basil and where Omori brings Sunny when Sunny confronts him.. . Red Space is sort of a stage of acceptance where Sunny considers himself to be a monster. It's the source of all the guilt and self-hatred in Sunny's mind.
this comment made me remember how messed up the game is after a few months without much contact. . thanks
so.. sunny's dad is a communist?!??!?!?!
I think you mean capitalist
same thing !1!!!!!1!!!1 (i have no brain)
Always has been.
Omori 2 is about sunny helping him out by entering Boyspace, where the tomboys have silly mouse chases and the boykissers shower him with love. To hide amongst them, he becomes a boymoder.
After reading the wiki to make sure, yup! It brings you to red space (Sunny route) or docks
What?! 
Yup! It’s terrifying, actually. I recommend it if you still have a save >!and don’t plan on doing a hikkimori run since you can only get to black space 2 normally in that route.!<
Are you able to do it if you've done the hikikomori route already?
Yes! I did the alternate route in both as I was trying to 100% and wanted to try it out in both.
Ohhh ok!
. . It's litterally this image wtf
Ngl I think that OMORI kinda looks like a piano too, his shorts are piano keys and his socks are the pedals😥
Makes sense, the black and white keys
WAIT
Nooo . . Great theory by the way.
I didn’t even think that OMORI could’ve been the brand name of the piano, I just thought SUNNY carved the name OMORI into it to remind him of the death of his sister.
I initially thought so too, but there is a piano in the town church that also has Omori etched on it. Which leads me to believe it's a brand name for all of those pianos
I thought this since I beat the game. I thought this was a more widely accepted theory?
Literally putting a piano in the dark world
I thought it was also partly because OMORI can mean weight in Japanese (重り= おもり= omori = weight) (correct me if I’m wrong) and OMORI is kind of like the weight of everything that SUNNY carries with him. And as the other comment mentioned, hikikomori. But this is also interesting to think about!
Yeah this clicked in my mind immediately when I saw the piano and I was surprised nobody was talking about it.. . Sunny felt like Mari loved the piano more than she loved him.
I thought it was a shortened version of “memento mori” because well…
I think it’s just because he is a hikikkomori 😭
Same. People wayyy overthink his name and try to add deeper meanings all the time
I mean, the reason is valid. It's literally in the game that the pianos are Omori brand.. . Also in one of the keyholes, you can choose between two tapes labelled "Omori" and "Basil". Choosing Omori shows you scene with Sunny sitting at the piano looking dejected. It's easy to assume that this is a moment where he creates that name for his alter self.. . And the fact that Omori's design/clothes are like a piano.. . They basically gave the name "Omori" an extra layer of meaning beyond it just being taken from a Japanese word.. . There's so much worse when it comes to overreaching, this is within normal grasp and logic.
I mean, the name Omori is on the two pianos, that was a deliberate writing decision. It would have been simpler to have left them unbranded.   . . Clearly she picked that as his name and as the brand name for the pianos because of the word hikikomori. But it is implied that the piano brand where he got his other name from in-universe. We see it written on the pianos, and only on the pianos. . . She doesn’t spell out the exact reason for the connection. But it’s not exactly a coincidence. She chose to put it there.
Omori fandom try not to reach challenge

*Accept the choco Sunny,the Omori plushies won't go away until you have tasted the true power of the Choco Sunny....*
Sunny's true trauma
The thing is that you don’t really question why it’s clams. It’s like opening watermelons as chests. Then you look deeper into it and it makes you sad. . . God I love this game.
Wait whats up with watermelons?
its a major childhood memory for him, smashing watermelons to eat them in the summer.
That, and "clams" is slang for cashy money, akin to "dough", "bread", and "cheddar".
Sounds like a tasty sandwich
Yeah, you don't add Clams (one explosion's worth) unless you're making *The Ultimate Sandwich*.
Who the hell says "cheddar"?
I've heard people use "cheddar" before, but not as often as them using "bread." Maybe the frequency of using "cheddar" depends on where you live.
Why use CLAMS when you can use CLEMS the currency of the future
i better invest everything into CLEMS, i cant lose!
But hey! That's just a theory. A GAME TH-
Its possible. I like to imagine its a spongebob reference
good bot
Good human.
For some reason it fits with how shells were currency in some ancient civilizations
because the future currency is clems
There's more to be found in this game for sure
ancient civilization
Where/when did it say he liked picking up CLAMS?
Wow, I completely forgot I made this post! How'd you find this lol  . I'm assuming it's implied... it's said nowhere that he likes collecting clams. I just found it interesting that CLAMS was the currency of Headspace, precisely because it isn't mentioned anywhere.
It seems like a very SUNNY thing to do

True, but it's funnier/sadder if he still is Sunny's dad and they just awkwardly meet without acknowledging each other.
certified gendo moment
Sunny get in the fucking red hands throne
I think they just re-used that sprite because we never see his father, I dont think he is Sunny's father in the actual game, thatd be weird if he just talked to him normally
Didn't we see a shadow sprite of him in a memory? When he's trying to cut down the tree and says Sunny is no longer his son? I wonder if the sprite matches up with this one (probably not).
If I'm remembering correctly: I think that sprite is only seen from behind, and hairstyle isn't really visible in the silhouette.. . It would be pretty cool though 
I'm sorry ****WHAT****!
oh my god. that's amazing. nice catch.
**WAIT WHAT!?**
😳
Most likely that's either a sprite that was repurposed, they decided to leave sunny's dad unseen, etc etc.
NANI!?!?!?!
I feel like the point with stuffed animals is jsut a children thing rather than an autism thing, my sister had stuffed animals when she was younger (hell she still does) and she doesnt have autism at all.. . But other than that, id say its possible sunny has autism, dont feel like its enough to say that he for sure has it but its possible.
Thanks for at least reading before giving criticism! I was mostly referring to the huge amount that he has. I will admit though that this point is probably the least firm, but since it’s common in kids with autism I thought I would include it.
Fair enough, tbf i did have some stuffed animals as a kid (i have very minor autism) that i was attached to but i still think its just a kid thing.
I also have very minor autism, and I had way too many stuffed animals lol. I had enough to fill just over two trash bags with when we were moving lol. (To be clear, we weren’t throwing them away, we were just moving them in the bags lol). . I wonder where all of them went. They are probably in our storage since I grew out of it as I got older.
sameee, i have so many damn stuffies, my mums concluded to keeping them in the shed til we work out what to tdo with them, we just keep getting more, i moved with like, 3, and now have like, 10, and a several pillows
Sunny is the box for me it's just to show something like "Hey he's very quiet and shy, look at him!!". . About Sunny and her toys: well he was a kid back then. . About the onigiris, I think it's because the color palettes =🍙
Who hasn't sat in a box that was bigger than them as a kid when there was an opportunity to do so?
Me (but even now I would do if I had the chance)
I never had a box that was bigger then me when I was younger
I understand the Joke that they share a color scheme and the names sound similar, but I wasn’t really focusing on the fact that it is onigiri, I was focusing on that it was made a point in the cook book that it’s not a normal way of serving it and that it’s bland.
If you can see the joke it's probably because that was the original point here
The very same joke could have been made with any form of onigiri, but the cook book goes out of its way to say he prefers it bland like this.
regarding the onigiri color scheme, they are white and green
Yes I know. It's more because it's pretty similar to Omori
The only one I can only confidently criticize is the Onigiri  one. I just believe this one isn’t correct because of the way Omori is set up to be a completely minimalist like when basil says in HS when comparing Omori to a. Flower:. . “And these... These are white tulips. Tulips aren't very flashy. plants. They're not too big or small, not too elaborate or. flamboyant.. If I could put it in another way... I guess I would say that.... They're comfortable, simple, modest, and perfect.”. . Not to mention the fact literally almost anything he owns, wears, and lives in is white and monochrome. It just fits with his theme to have a plain onigiri with salt. It’s black and white, no other colors. Plain and simple just like Omori. I do understand that the fact that autistic people do sometimes have odd food tastes, but Omori is a monochrome emotionless boy, so the food choice is a joke that just fits. Plus, it’s omori’s favorite food and not Sunny’s. For all we know Sunny’s favorite food isn’t Omori’s and he’s just fitting that theme of minimalism. . Now I’m not saying this disproves the evidence you out up for Sunny being autistic, in fact I’m not going to try to argue against the other points because:. . 1. Not trying to disprove sunny is autistic just one piece of evidence I don’t really agree should be evidence . . 2. Don’t have the knowledge available to try to disprove the other evidence. . 3. Since it’s not explicitly canon, it’s more like a head canon and there’s no point in disproving those. . So yeah that’s about it. I can see why people would think that sunny is autistic, and if it makes people relate to him better, I see no harm in doing so.
I agree but I just want to point out that the white tulip dialogue you mentioned is about Sunny, not Omori.. This one is Omori's:. >Ah... These are white tulips.. Plain, simple, and bulbous... just like OMORI!
Ah ok thanks
The attraction toward the box, I believe, is a parallelism to Mewo, where Sunny’s timid personality is compared to a cat. Fun fact: according to Dr. Mikel Delgado, cats instinctually like boxes because of warmth.. . The onigiri is also a parallel to Omori’s admittedly bland color pallet and personality.. . As for the stuffed animals… He was a kid, and I’m pretty sure he was planning to throw them out.. . According to [this article](), “some 70-80 percent of people with ADS suffer from hypersensitivity or undersensitivity to neural stimulation through the various senses, including sight, touch, and taste.” Going back to the stuffed animal photo, Sunny seems unfazed by close contact with multiple people. \*I know I am generalizing, and please correct me if I am incorrect.. . Edit: Though I am not autistic and cannot speak for those who are, I can confidently say as a timid child, I displayed many of these traits. Me disagreeing doesn’t necessarily mean I’m attempting to invalidate your theories; it just means through my similar though limited experiences, I have a hard time seeing Sunny as not just being shy. 
It’s definitely a valid interpretation! This game is written in such a way that you can draw many conclusions about many of the characters.. . Sunny is often credited with DID, Autism, and other diagnoses. . Kel is almost always interpreted with ADHD or ADD, Aubrey I’ve seen interpretations of acute stress disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, among other things, etc!. . That’s one of the great things about the game. It can tackle a lot of these issues without ever directly calling to them
Maybe I'm just projecting with ASD myself, but I remember beginning to think that at the beginning of the game after turning off the computer in white space. More of a sensory thing. "The heat from the laptop warmed your lap. It felt nice". It might not be ASD but I know that mf isn't neurotypical.
Yeah, since a lot of people seem to disagree I’m starting to wonder if I’m just projecting, but I agree that he definitely isn’t neutraltpical
he just like me fr
You definitely have a point and tbh another great detail is the way emotions work. They are a game mechanic, a combat strat to use in battle to get an advantage over your enemies. They are tools, that you can learn and acquire in order to complete a task, they aren’t an experience. Idk if this makes sense but to me it kinda adds up to the autism argument. . Still I don’t agree with you but it’s an interesting pov nonetheless
It's a very well stated theory, although I disagree with it
Good bot
a lot of people here are stating that bc omori's colour scheme is black and white: it refutes the fact that he could be autistic. . however one autistic trait that isn't talked about bc it's not super common is synthesisa & colour sensitivity. now i'm not saying he has synthesisa, butttt i know lots of autistic people who pick certain colour schemes for their furniture and stuff bc it doesn't overwhelm their senses. think about white space. empty. barely any sensory input. the only extra colour we see in there is red... . . idk i feel like a lot of the comments here are from people who don't have neurodivergency n won't agree but of course i doubt this'll ever be confirmed or not... but remember it's ok to have headcanons, op !! you made some great points there tbh and i see what you mean. ^^
As someone with autism I can confirm, this is relatable. Every point.
 well, Sunny, do you have autism?  .  uhh.. sure?  .  well there you have it
As someone with autism (and depression unfortunately), I relate very heavily to characters like Sunny. So I could say it’s a possibility.
I’m autistic and this was my headcanon. Idk I just vibe with him.
As someone else with autism i completely agree
I agree! And I think the fact that he doesn't speak definitely points to him being nonverbal or minimally verbal. It would make a lot of sense.
Cool theory, even though I disagree with it
This is the first time I've seen someone suggest that about Sunny and honestly, I'm not sure. I'm not very educated on how conditions like Autism and ADHD work (despite having friends who have both and are very open about it to me).. . I never had the feeling that he was Autistic, but I related to him anyway because I was a pretty quiet, shy, imaginative, and depressed kid around his age. . . Honestly, I think anything's possible. Regardless if that's what was intended or not, I think a mark of a really good character is if nearly everyone can see a part of themselves in them.
I think so, yeah
It's one of my hc's!
Sunny has PTSD, he locked himself away for four years after mari... Leading to most of whitespace and lack of social interaction. Same can go for Basil.
He definitely isn't neurotypical
I think he does
I’m convinced tbh
i have autism and this is a headcanon of mine, but i don’t know if there’s much hard evidence in canon. but that’s the fun of headcanons!
As an autistic, yes.
I'm autistic and I relate to SUNNY a lot because of these factors. It mightn't be canon, but I like to believe it is! 
And in Foe Facts OMORI complains about an enemy because it was too noisy. And at one point in the game, if you interact with Sunny's bed, something like "Your bed, it used to be Mari's, but she gave you the bed when she realized you couldn't sleep."
this just proved more that i might be sunny
Kids being kids = autism?
Come on Sunny was NOT the typical kid lmfao, not saying Op is right but still…
this post is making me think i might have autism lol
It goes undiagnosed in a lot of people, but don’t use this post as your deciding factor. If you really think you might have autism I recommend asking around the official subreddit or talking to a professional.
I don't think so,. Sunny is a typical introvert.. If he is to have anything anymore it is mutism.
Not talking much =/= autism 
Did you even read any of my post? Only one of the four points I made involves him not talking, and even that point isn’t about him not talking throughout the game, it’s about a note made in the photo album.. . If you are going to comment with criticism, at least read the post first. I specifically made this post starting off by saying that I wasn’t going to use something like that as one of my points.
I did read the whole post. The other points make even less sense to connect him to autism so i didn't point it out.
Could you please explain why you think they don’t make sense? Maybe you could help me improve the points by going more in-depth, or I could just try to better explain it to you.
You don't diagnose people having autism just because of  these behaviors that anyone could have. Not talking much, liking other food and stuffed toys, anybody could have these traits. I respect your opinion though, have a great day.
I’m sorry but I don’t see any other way to possibly diagnose a fictional character. Thanks for sharing your opinion though
≠    . have this for future copy+paste purposes
was too lazy to find it 
hes not autistic, just shy
Sunny with autism?... nah i dont think so but is a good theory
no
Come back after you finish the game. It'll all make sense eventually. 
He just shy boi
imo it's not concrete enough without examples that don't have double meanings. Also imo a theory of this caliber needs to be very rigor because it potentialy goes against some of the game themes.. . I wont expand on this because it's spoilers. Have fun with the game OP
ik you said you won’t expand on it because spoilers, and that’s perfectly fine, but i’m curious as to why this would go against some of the game themes? you could just spoiler tag it
Sure thing. . >!The idea that Sunny is on the spectrum could have a varying impact on the plot of game, and depending on interpretation, it might even be a pillar in the causes for the accident and the events following it.!<. . >!This essentially introduces another force into Sunny’s and the game’s dynamic. One of the problems with it is that without extensive knowledge about Sunny’s autism, we cannot precisely know which events happened because of it, because of the Trauma or because of some other cause. This is what I meant that it needs to be properly rigor!<. . >!Another problem is that by definition it weakens the affects PTSD has on Sunny in general.  Since the force that was originally one, is now split into two weaker forces that affected Sunny’s actions.!<. . >!I say that it is potentially against the game’s themes because my interpretation of it is that its purpose is to describe trauma. And that by loosely introducing a different major idea, you muddy and hurt the game’s meaning.!<. . >!That is not to say that Sunny being autistic necessarily contradicts the game’s purpose but without clear intentions and strong thematics it would be very hard to understand it in a way that is up to the game’s standards.!<
it's definitely possible, but it also sounds like he's just a normal, but quiet kid (before what happened at least) But, i can definitely see where you are coming from
not a huge fan of the use of the word "normal" here. autistic people are normal people, it's not weird to be autistic
¿How do you think everyone reacted when they saw Sunny's body?...I can't imagine how broken it will have been after the fall.
i find it funny how a lot of you are talking about the comically large hospital but i actually found another comment of theirs where they calculated the exact height of the hospital based on how far and long Sunny was falling. i was originally going to post it with this (but figured it would make the post too long) but i think they wrote about how it ended being up being somewhere above 12,000 ft. tall or something lmao
Missing the fact that Sunny ended up like a broken egg after impact , and what's next...¿Sunny will end up in hell? because apart from killing his sister by accident he committed suicide, well I'm just saying.. . oh wait...forget what I said, this says it all...except the SPLASH part.
I dont think Sunny ends up in hell because he tried to defeat his demons but was unsuccessful, I think he goes to hell only during the hikikomori route or the "hell route"
mmm that makes sense
İ think omoris knife orginated from the time where mari accidently hurt herself with a knife and it was the only time sunny seen her cry. . İ think this is supported by the red knife which says you see something aka mari on it . . So basically because both the knife and sunny hurt mari,sunny thinks that he is no differant then the knife so he uses it and as sunny fades the massage changes accordingly "you see a reflaction on the blade" "You can no longer see your reflection." . . And after sunny dissapears in the omori route "It's not what it used to be." "You can see something in the blade.". . İ also maybe say thats why omori letting go of the knife is a big deal,as sunny no longer sees himself only as something that hurt mari but thats bit of a strech
It's just before memory lane in sunnys house,you can go to the kitchen and intract with the cutting board
Oh! Interesting!
Omori is the name of Mari's piano.  You can find this out by investigating the piano at the end of the game.  Sunny took on the name "Omori" in his dream world because he wanted to be something that he knew she loved.
Damn you're probably right
140 days late but ow my heart
how does it feel now 4 years later?
Gosh I really don’t care at all and have entirely forgotten this game
oh, sorry for summoning you back then
owh man that's such a switch up
I’m not saying it like I don’t care about the story or the characters, I’ve just consumed so much content since this post that I genuinely barely remember anything about omori. It’s been over four years.
ahh i see
Also the name of the piano in the church though
I think it’s meant to be like the brand of the piano, like e.g. ”YAMAHA”
Yeah, that's what I thought
"Omori" (おもり) is a japanese word meaning "weight" or "sinker"
and this is why u should ALWAYS check all ur options before making a decision *coughcough* sunny…
>!Just finished it as well. The ending feels a lot bittersweet but I'm happy I got to play this experience!<
So I have a few questions. Was Sunny just a psychopath? Did he kill his cat?  Was it his idea or Basil's to stage the suicide? Why is Basil so significant to Sunny? Did his dad figure it out?
It's heavily implied that Mari broke his violin, they got in a fight, and then he pushed her down the stairs.  He didn't kill his cat as far as I can tell.  There isn't anything to truthfully imply the he did in the real world.  It was Basil's idea to stage the suicide.  Basil convinced Sunny that since they were both good people that there was a "monster behind" Sunny that pushed Mari down the stairs and killed her.  Accepting the responsibility for their actions is the whole point of the story.  Basil is Sunny's friend and was a witness to Sunny's manslaughter.  There is nothing to imply that anyone knew about the manslaughter outside of Basil and Sunny.
The police aka an autopsy would figure out really quick the cause of death. Which means his family aka Mom and Dad knew that she didnt kill herself. Which explains the 2 points in the game with the unknown shadow figures one being Sunnys Dad saying: "You are not my son anymore". . (Its strongly implied his Dad left him & his Mom). . And the Mom saying: "I dont want to lose another child" (Implying she took Sunnys side in a argument between her & his Dad/her husband). . There was also a scene where (implied to be Sunnys Dad) a shadow figure trys to cut away the cursed tree saying "Why wont you fall". . Over and over again.. . Tho no idear if he killed cat or not. If he killed the cat it could explain why he always throws up at seeing meat/his favorite steak. (If he cut up the cat he would have seen all the innards etc). . Techniclly the cat should still be around at that point if there was no illness etc. But we never saw the cat again so maybe Sunny killed it but idk why he would do it or at what point/timeline wise it would happen/happend. . Maybe the whole violin thing and Mari implied to be hard on him/putting tons of pressure on him made him do it? The Dreamworld gives us the "perfect Mari" but the implications are that Mari was just "perfect" and he coulndt keep up with her which made him resent playing the violin & spending time to pratice with Marie rathern than enjyoing his time with all his friends.. . But again i dont really know why he would kill the cat becaue its was also his pet and he seemed to care a lot for it according to the photo comments.. . PS: The only hint as to "why he could/would do it" was that Mewo was a "bad Cat" whatever that means. Its tricky it could just be another Nightmare but then again it was in Blackspace the place where he stored all the rejected/sealed of memories of his guilt. So maybe he did kill his cat but what his motivation beyond "was a bad Cat" was/could be idk.
> The police aka an autopsy would figure out really quick the cause of death. Which means his family aka Mom and Dad knew that she didnt kill herself. Which explains the 2 points in the game with the unknown shadow figures one being Sunnys Dad saying: "You are not my son anymore". . Autopsies on suicides are not common.  The family has to opt into them.   They also cost thousands of dollars, so most families don't do it.. . > (Its strongly implied his Dad left him & his Mom). . This is common after a child suicide.  I know several families this has happened to.  Most don't stay together after the death of a child.. . . > And the Mom saying: "I dont want to lose another child" (Implying she took Sunnys side in a argument between her & his Dad/her husband). . It would be understandable to assume Sunny would kill himself after his sister did so.  This is very common.. . > There was also a scene where (implied to be Sunnys Dad) a shadow figure trys to cut away the cursed tree saying "Why wont you fall". . I would cut down that fucking tree too.. . > Maybe the whole violin thing and Mari implied to be hard on him/putting tons of pressure on him made him do it? The Dreamworld gives us the "perfect Mari" but the implications are that Mari was just "perfect" and he coulndt keep up with her which made him resent playing the violin & spending time to pratice with Marie rathern than enjyoing his time with all his friends.. . It's left ambiguous on purpose..  . > But again i dont really know why he would kill the cat becaue its was also his pet and he seemed to care a lot for it according to the photo comments.. . I don't know why he would have killed the cat either.. . > PS: The only hint as to "why he could/would do it" was that Mewo was a "bad Cat" whatever that means. Its tricky it could just be another Nightmare but then again it was in Blackspace the place where he stored all the rejected/sealed of memories of his guilt. So maybe he did kill his cat but what his motivation beyond "was a bad Cat" was/could be idk.. . The game says that the "cat" was one of the old ones that looked over the boy.  I believe it's trying to imply that the cat was the last thing keeping him sane.  But now that the cat is gone, he has nothing.
It’s implied that the mother and father knew. The mother didn’t want to lose her only son after the altercation and the father completely abandoned his son after what happened. They definitely knew it wasn’t just a regular suicide.
I don't think he killed the cat in real life but in his head space he views himself as evil/soulless so killing the cat in his head is revealing how he views himself as a killer by nature, if that makes sense.
I have always thought Sunny's father took the cat.
Perhaps blaming Mewo over the death of Mari, after all he “was a bad cat” and Sunny didn’t kill her, it was “a thing behind him”
Maybe as Sunny pushed Mari she tripped over Mewo which caused her to fall down the stairs? This could be why Mewo is a "bad cat" and why Sunny possibly killed him
This was my theory as well - it would track with the "bad cat" line and the dark mass line (obviously not perfectly, but it is still a black cat).. . In a stressful situation like that, I could see a young child like Sunny grasping at anything that could explain away his culpability, including the cat.
Maybe? But i thought "that thing behind him" was just the "monster" Basil & Sunny saw. Basil that weird dark mass of tentacle -like things & Sunny the floating "eye" (the corpse "looking" at him). . Its a really weird sequence with Mewo.
Actually I don't think Mari broke Sunny's violin, as they've been practising for this recital for a very long time together. And also, according to the Wiki, they found transcripts of the photos from That Day. In the transcript, for the photo with the broken violin, it says, "Photo of a Broken Violin - Your precious violin lay shattered at the bottom of the staircase. You threw it in a rage. Your fingers were shaking in pain... practicing over and over... but you still make mistakes after mistakes. This was all a bad idea.". . &#x200B;. . Link to Google Docs (which is from the Wiki): [. . (transcripts of the photos are found towards the end of the document) . . &#x200B;. . In case you want to see the Wiki page: [.. . (link to the Google Docs was found in the last sentence of the Wiki page, "All information regarding the OMORI route can be found [here]().")
Ohhh. From the "blood and hair" in the violin, I had assumed Sunny hit Mari over the head with it and knocked her down the stairs that way. If she was already bludgeoned, she'd be less likely to catch her fall. (Though I guess her "bad knee" also kept her from catching her fall.)
no sunny threw the violin himself. its stated under the picture of the broken violin in basils truth's photo album that sunny threw it in a rage because he kept on making mistakes
Sunny killed Mari by accident. I don't think it's ever said whose idea it was initially, but they both made the conscious decision to stage her suicide. Basil is so significant because he knows the truth of what happened to Mari, and his photo album kinda makes him the keeper of Omori's real world memories. Because he knows the truth, he is also the one to lead Sunny out of his headspace. So far I haven't found anything in-game about his Dad other than their family photo.
This game was incredible.
God I feel destroyed after finishing the game... Definitely gonna take me a few days to emotionally recover from this :') . . But yeah gotta say that this game was definitely worth the wait. Although very dark, I really do like the story and how it depicts Sunny's inner struggles in a very impactful way. The second hand guilt is real, even just by watching the game I'm able to feel the weight of his actions. (Also that final duet at the end hit me like a trainwreck). . One thing is that I feel like the game really hits you with all the heavy stuff at the end (and in a rather fast paced manner compared to the dream world stuff). Maybe that just makes it more impactful but yeah my mind went from like: cute fluffy RPG to Oh God I'm gonna have nightmares for days (even tho I knew it was gonna be scary at some point but damn psychological horror hits hard).. . Also although I know Basil is probably one of the most crucial parts to the story, I kinda wonder what would have happened if he wasn't there. Would Sunny still have faked the suicide? Would he ever be able to escape white space without Basil being there to represent reality? Just some random questions I guess haha . . Anyways, wow that was a journey and definitely one of the most emotional games I've played / seen in awhile (oh and bonus points to the game for having an absolute memorizing soundtrack)
And the question i have. What if Mary was still alive? What if they killed her by hanging her up? (on accident of course cause they though shes dead)
Uhh, Basil is the one made into nothing, since Omori keeps erasing him, not wanting his presence to remind him of the truth.. . Sunny is the one who's split into two. Sunny and Omori.
Well to be honest, the "why Mari died?" Answer is such a terrible disapointment.... . Ok so, just some things we (wife and i) picked up before finding out... . . . . . . . 1- so many hands: massive múltiple hands usually show up on drawings of molested children.. and they we're friggin everywhere in the Game whenever sunny tries to repress something Bad.. . 2- the showers: there is a drawing on the notebook and some appear in blackspace.. . 3- many, many, many, many chopped up bodies: a Lot of them in blackspace, mostly in one particular room.. . Sooooo... See where i'm going? Up to a certain point we believed that, the "Saint Mari, loved by all, puré and white" was maybe molesting sunny, one day, while showering she tried to, without knowing that basil was surprise visiting and he Saw her molesting sunny... She tried to silence basil and sunny tried to protect him, and smashed her with the violín, alowing basil to fight back, witch caused her to fall to her death... Afraid, they tried to dispose of the body (maybe tried to chop it? But didn't seem likely to us), afraid to accept the horrible truth about who Mari was, sunny blocked everything about that, and also blocked basil pushing Mari to her death (that's would explain why Even in blackspace, basil appears as his idealized persona), and the trauma was because, Even with the molesting, she was his sister and he still loved her a Lot, and would be a bit more of a story of flawed people, still loving each other despite all and trying to better themselves (because they are all somewhat flawed after all, specially sunny, Aubrey and basil). . Sounds a bit of an edgy theory, but would explain the showers drawings (because lets be honest, they are never adressed) and the manymanymanymanymanymany hands that seem to Chase sunny everywhere.... . Then i found out why Mari died and i gotta Say i was expecting something more elaborated... . Edit: i guess we were expecting this because we hate those "i'm so perfect and puré" characters (such as mari) in this kind of games, cuz these games are about realistic people dealing with real emotions, and to be fair, and such "puré and perfect" people do not exist un the real world... we can agree that everyone has flaws and it's ok to...
Mari isn’t depicted as perfect and pure though. You get hints of her extreme perfectionism when the recital is mentioned. In that last photo album, it shows her blocking Sunny from running away after yelling at him (which led to him pushing her down the stairs out of desperation). . . I think hands are a motif because of Sunny’s struggle to accept what he’s done. Also tbh if you think Mari is the “pure and perfect” cliche then Hero fits it too.
I'm a little late, but most of what we see of Mari is a dream version of herself. Since we never actually interact with her in the real world, we can't really say she was perfect. After dying, it also makes sense everyone in the real world would talk highly of her, though It seems her perfectionism was her biggest flaw. It seems she was arguing with Sunny the night she died because he wasn't practicing as much as he should be for their recital. Sunny, feeling angry and not good enough accidently lashes out, killing her. She had a standard she was pushing upon him, though I'm not sure if it was to help him become better or for her to not be dragged down while preforming. There's a link a bit above to a good doc with descriptions in the files for the game for each of the photos showing the murder. Those put a lot into context.
there's something i don't understand, how did sunny's violin fall down the stairs??? some people say that he threw it because he was mad, some says that mari dropped it on accident????
What’s the truth? I’m playing through this and it’s scaring the hell out of me
The truth to what?
I just watched it cuz I have no mones but damn the good end gave me lots of feels.
At some point we hear sunny (presumably) say “stupid stupid stupid”
Sunny = Leon
I believe it's wrong.. . The distortions are an opposite to the Violin, that is Sunny. When Sunny confronts Omori, who is his fear, at the start Sunny approaches it with clarity, which is symbolized by the refined violin music. But the more Sunny fights with his fears, the more violent they become. The distortions means that Sunny's clarity is diminishing.. . As for the voices, they do seem to be Mari's voice from the night of the accident, likely in the moment he pushed her. As for the sights, these are his fears expanding and becoming more violent, like I said;. . * Hell mari is the fear that his sister hates him for what he did.. * The friends that are hanged is Sunny's fear of what will happen to them if he were to reveal the truth. This could either mean that they *actually* killed themselves because of it or that they are dead to him (or vise versa), as in they wont be his friends and never accept him after what he did. (it could be a mix of both as well). * And lastly Omori and the darkness. That is Sunny's fear of facing the consequences, aka, escapism and/or Omori. That would also be the fear of the same nature as the one that caused the truth in the first place. . sorry for the bad formatting i need sleep i have school in 4 hours (L) so gn:2028:. . edit: basically the point is, that it's not that he is remembering while fighting Omori, Sunny already pretty much remembers the truth (from the truth album sequence mainly). This is also supported by the fact that you don't have to reach the final stage of the omori fight and that dying yields the same results.  . okay now actually gn
To your theory of in the heat of the fight sunny throws his violin down the stairs. . . The in game files with captions for the BS pictures and official timeline of what happens is iirc . . . Sunny gets frustrated and throws the violin down the stairs, Mari starts yelling at him for destroying all their hard work, Sunny tries to run away down the stairs, Mari blocks his path, Sunny isn't thinking and pushes her away.
Damn. This is what I love about this game. Because of the "unreliable narrator" and the game's basis being the exploration of Sunny's Psyche... there's strangely more and more interpretations of the games scenes that I never thought about.. . Yeah I should play hikikomori route though. I only know about Black Space 2. Not the events in them.
Alright boys let's start operation sleep deprive the Snuuy
oh yeh
..aight cool
"angry and irritable". . *stab*. . *pulls out the pepper spray*
his first stage of anger is more like enraged
yeah is true.
Probably - he spends most of his sleep lucid dreaming. That can't be healthy.
Doesn't sunny have PTSD and stuff like that?
hmmm interesting
I think he just lucid dreams. Lucid dreams occur during the REM period, and there's no way his dreams have continuing storylines and are able to warp him back to his safe white space without him controlling them. his headspace is too advanced for him to not be fully conscious when in it
I’ll make a comment on why I think the supernatural elements of the game are real, but I used up all my energy making this post.
Fair, I can't argue that, it looks like you made a college essay my dude
Another thing to note is that forgiveness isn't something that necessarily happens instantly either. Like, Sunny dropping that bombshell would absolutely require that everyone else take some time to process it, and facing their feelings on the matter, seeing what they've been through and done and understanding the connections made here would take time.. . That's part of why I think the ending works so well; forgiveness started with Sunny forgiving himself, and his healing was core to the game, but everyone else is also gonna go on their own journey for this. So the game ends with him telling the truth, both because even if he somehow isn't forgiven despite all prior textual support, he can still heal, and because forgiveness is complex. How the rest of the friends do on their journey is ultimately up to them, and it's not something that ought to be squeezed into a single ending cutscene. Not when the rest of the game gives so much weight to that journey and the effort it takes to face those feelings and confront yourself and your flaws.
I really like that part. A part of the self forgiveness process Sunny went through was accepting his friends may not forgive him. . . Both Sunny and the Player(us) find out the truth and details surrounding the truth at the same time.  Most of us forgive Sunny around the same that he forgave himself.. . Both Sunny and the Player don’t know how the friends will react to the truth but we’ve accepted that. We don’t know what comes next, but whatever comes next Sunny forgave himself
So is the answer that they forgive him or not? Whats your perspective on that? (I know this is old but Omori won't succumb to time)
I do firmly believe that the main message of the game is forgiveness of oneself, so I think that, if at nothing else, even if everyone decides to stop being friends over the truth, I doubt they will hold it against Sunny. They may not be able to stay friends with Sunny, but that’s life. Sometimes you’ll lose friends, but sometimes you don’t. In the end, I think that at the very least, they will learn to live with the truth, and will learn to at least understand why Sunny did what he did
Congratulations! You got the point of the game. Very rare to see media literate nowadays
Realistically, they probably won't forgive him considering the fact that MARI can't come back and what SUNNY did is permanent but I do believe they'll eventually forgive him, but I highly doubt they will still stay in touch with SUNNY or BASIL because of feelings of resentment. Because the game takes place in SUNNY's pov, we don't know if what we see is what the party's really like and humans are complex so something like forgiveness for such a serious situation like this is also complex and their decision to forgive them might go against who we see them as in the game.
I would say it can easily go both ways. But the fact that Sunny smiles at the end of the secret cutscene just makes me want a happy ending that they eventually do. Even if it wasnt related to the friends, it ended on a high note, which makes me believe so.
Yeah but maybe they smiled because they finally told the truth, who knows
Yes, that is certainly the top part of it. I just feel like they wouldn't smile if their friends told them "Am never talking to you again, I hate you" y'know? Doesn't match.
yes thats it. Even If they dont forgive him now they will latter. Or else they would have lost again the whole point of the game
hola quería comentar que en los créditos la letra del tema Good Morning nos dice de forma indirecta que sunny no supero su depresión en partes como "recuerdos del pasado del bueno y del malo me abruman" y tomando en cuenta que la mayor preocupación de sunny era perder a sus amigos probable que no se halla reconciliado con ellos (o al menos no con todos) . . aunque realmente nunca habrá una respuesta 100% canónica
Usando el Traductor de Google. . No diría que esas letras refutan que sus amigos lo perdonen o que Sunny nunca mejore. Decir la verdad fue el primer paso en el largo camino hacia la recuperación. Se sentirá abrumado por las cosas, tanto los buenos como los malos recuerdos. Creo que la mejor evidencia del perdón es que Sunny le sonríe a Basil en el final bueno. Si lo atacaran o le dijeran que se cayera muerto, creo que sería mucho menos feliz.
This is better than every school essay I ever wrote... 
❤️
Specifically, what drives Sunny to hysteria is that she isn't breathing, so she would have died from asphyxiation before being hung, even if the internal decapitation hadn't killed her instantly.
There's a couple scenes in black space where Mari is in a bed and when you click on her she's not breathing, implying she was dead for sure by the time Sunny and Basil carried her back downstairs
One thing to keep in mind, however, is that both Sunny and Basil were 12 when this occurred. They wouldn't know how to check if she was breathing or not. They might have just looked at her chest to see if it was raising or not, and even if it wasn't, being knocked unconscious causing your breathing to slow down immeasurably, making it difficult to see if she was breathing from a visual que. At 12, they wouldn't know how to check for a pulse or know CPR or anything to that degree... Sunny is an unreliable narrator... In the same way as the closet in the house isn't shown until later in the story because he blocked it off from his mind.
I knew how to check a pulse at 12 years old lol. I think that's a little presumptuous to just assume they'd be too ignorant. They're 12 years old, not 4.
Bruh do you really think everyone knows how to check a pulse at 12 years old. I bet most don't
girl not every 12 year old is like you, when i was 12 i didnt know how to that shit
I also knew how to check for a pulse at 12 but I was a weird fuckin kid man.. . Anyways, it is possible to be alive and breathing but with such a faint heartbeat and such shallow breaths that it can't be detected even by a trained medical professional unless they have proper equipment. . . Comas can look like that, and cataleptic seizures look like that. Both of which can happen after falling down the stairs. It's totally possible she could be alive and breathing but omori just can't tell. . Imo though I don't think maris supposed to be dead or alive, I think she's supposed to be both. It's a Schrodinger's cat kind of thing, our protagonist was way too unstable to reliably tell us what happened, especially since we can only see him reliving it in his memory. As a result from Sunny's perspective, he killed Mari, and he murdered Mari. Basil made him do it, and basil is a victim of Sunny's mistake. All of those can be true even if they are contradictory and I think that's a big part of why sunny is so fucked up by the time the story starts, he can't know for sure which horrible reality to believe so he has to contend with all of them being equally real in his head
he could have felt the air go from her nose or mouth though to see if she was breathing.
´´with such a faint heartbeat and such shallow breaths that it c*an't be detected even by a trained medical professional unless they have proper equipment* ´´ I highly doubt some 12 year old kid has the right equipment for that situation. but  \\i see where youre coming from, i think?
The eye is probably for symbolism or some way of horror. Plus it relates her back to Something. Eyes being open once the body had died is actually pretty common, and can happen just by the fact that muscles aren’t locking it open or closed. As for being paralyzed, to do so she would have had to hit her neck pretty hard. And while that’s totally possible, it only paralyzes the spinal cord, and getting suddenly paralyzed doesn’t always mean you’ll pass out. Also there’s no confirmation, at least none that I know of, that she even paralyzed herself. Plus, if you paralyze your spine you can still talk usually.. . Seems more like she probably died to blunt force trauma(?). . Either way she’s dead in the end, by hanging or by being pushed lol. . I can’t really say what exactly might have killed her, other than falling. But I believe she probably died there, since Sunny didn’t immediately decide to hang her after she fell and waited (an albeit undetermined amount of time) before he went through with it
Wait how did it even successfully get framed as a suicide in the first place? Most people who hang themselves die from asphyxiation, and not a snapped neck, plus the bruising from falling down the stairs and possibly being impaled by the broken parts of the violin could also give it away.
I hate how absolutely right this sounds. I didn't think the "truth" could feel any worse, but it do. This makes me consider the extent to which the player (and, in turn, Sunny), is willing to stretch their denial (by first believing in the suicide, then the accident). Because that's just how psychologically traumatizing this theory is at its core. I mean, I already found Something frightening enough, but this is DARK. How would Sunny even begin to tell his friends this? Ugh, and then you take this juxtaposed to how Mari, when Sunny's life was in danger, tried to save him without hesitation. Oh god, the self-loathing is real. Well done.. . Alright, now take me back to Headspace pls, I cannot cope.
I got that Impression too. Imaginary Basil also mentions that he makes things worse when he tries to help. I know this could still apply even if she wasn't alive because coving up your sister's death is more trauma on top of being the one who killed her but it did stick out to me especially since this line is near the reveal iirc. Attention only being drawn to her eyes being open after she was hanged also made me think she was still alive. Iirc in the photos leading up to her being hanged, you can't see her eyes and wouldn't Sunny noticed if her open eyes when he tried to wake her, which would also be a traumatic image but isn't the one that haunts sunny the most. This could just be a creative oversize to make the reveal that Mari's body is the SOMETHING more impactful. . . However, I could see it being plausible that no one found her real cause of death. Maybe people were reluctant to investigate farther because of the trauma it would cause the family, foul play not being expected in small town suburbs etc. Also if someone thought it wasn't suicide, there isn't really much to go one to prove otherwise.
This actually was my first thought when I saw the scene where you see her eye. Why would the eye be looking directly at Sunny unless she was somewhat conscious? Along with all the other evidence you’ve given. In my opinion it makes it all the more horrifying because it went from killing in a moment of rage to purposefully doing something and (while unintentional because they thought she was already dead) directly killing her.
OMG. . they did good job with that. but also there are teories that omori couldn't know that she was not breathing or we can't really trust sunny with that
Or Sunny was actually playing the piano.. . Either way, it's a nice scene that makes for an interesting question.
I agree with you, us spectators could be mislead by sunny's perception. . Bare in mind he hid from us a fuckinf door for most of the game
He strait up halucinated an entire section of the game in the recylcultist
either way mari forgives sunny (or he imagined it but thinks it is true) which is what lets him forgive himself
He seems too far from the piano to play that good ngl, he must have some really long hands and fingers...
Well if he can erase a door from existence, he can surely shift his position by few centimeters
He didn't erase a door from existence, he just denied it was there.
Yea, but from our point of view it wasn't there at all, so we can assume he can manipulate what we see, which probably includes his exact position
Because we are the player, not Sunny. We don't see it so we can understand that Sunny doesn't want to see it/believe it is real. Show don't tell, you know.
We’re watching from Sunny’s POV, like the thing with the door, so if he did move forward and subconsciously play the piano we wouldn’t have seen.
The headspace gang feels a bit dishonest and shallow, like they are exaggerated versions of the things Sunny most remembers them by, and not actually their own individuals. Aubrey and Kel fight. Hero is a hard worker and charismatic. Basil likes flowers and photos. Mari is always nice and hosts picnics.. . And then you have characters that are manifestations of Sunny's feelings, like Something being the guilt that haunts him, or Stranger being his duty to accept and confess the Truth.. . But Spirit Mari feels a bit different imo. She seems more nuanced like the Faraway characters, sounding conflicted in many of her lines and offering a perspective that Sunny wouldn't have seen himself. It really seems like she was meant to be an actual ghost trying to comfort Sunny from beyond the grave and not just a headspace construct.
Don’t forget omori. Omori is like the guardian of his mind. Like an attempt to forget about **the truth** and to keep sunny happy, no matter what it takes. *poor guy tried to repress the truth for like 4 years all for sunny to acknowledge it in 3 days*
Finally someone gives credit to Omori.
Hero is never shown to hallucinate anywhere in game, so it would be weird if he suddenly does out of nowhere and then never brought up again. Sunny and Basil on the other hand have actual reasons on why they hallucinate, so it would make more sense if it was only Sunny that was hallucinating
I never subscribed to this. I just don't think Sunny's mom wouldn't say that she left him food and then leave raw meat. . . He got sick because >!the power for the fridge hasn't been available for hours, like half of a day or so, so it sat there and got warmed up!<
omori and sunny dance to gangnam style at the end of the story sorry
1. You are (Spoilers for what Omori is trying to do with the world) >!Not right, it's better for Omori to extend the time that Sunny will spend in Headspace for a reason that i won't say because it plays an important part late-game!<. . 2. You are (Spoilers for the purpose of Headpsace) >!very right, Headspace is a safe place that Omori created for Sunny. It's to escape reality!<. . 3. I don't really know if you are right here, white space is kinda mysterious but the lightbulb is important later on. . 4. How do you escape most dreams? By dying right? That's probably why you can stab yourself.. . 5. Can't answer this one. We don't really know anything about why a knife is Omor's main weapon
5. And I don't think there's a reason is there?. . Knives are just the archetypical tool of choice for these contexts.. It's like asking "why does the kid wear baseball hat".
>! 1. Avoidance/daydreaming is not a healthy coping mechanism, and is really just ignoring your emotions instead of working through them. In order to be happy, Sunny needs to face what happened to him and learn to find peace while living in reality!<
Sunny made headpspace to forget >!The truth!<, and reality can remind him that >!Mari is dead, which xould lead to him remembering the truth!<, i did not say that what Sunny is doing is healthy.
>! Exactly… Sunny needs to remember the truth in order to overcome it. !<. . >! It’s understandable why Omori did what he did, he was only trying to help, but nonetheless, it wasn’t ultimately the best thing for Sunny. !<. . >! I really don’t see what you’re trying to get at here. !<
I told OP if the theory he made was right or not, that's it.
Late af but I’m afraid what actually happens is that joe rogan will body slam Freddy fivebear and you’ll find out sunny actually moistcritical before he grew a beard
Why is Sunny in Slytherin? I thought only ambitious people and (for some inexplicable reason) assholes go there
Cunning, resourceful, a strong leader, a disregard for the rules
Strong leader? You're thinking of omori.. Edit: dont know where the disregard of rules thing comes from, could also be omori but sunny is a pretty great rule-follower.
Omori is a part of Sunny.
Omori and sunny are the same person
Im pretty sure omori is supposed to be a "better" version of sunny. They may be the same person, but they have many differences.
No... Not really. Omori is way braver than sunny among a lot of other things (stronger, fearless, less emotional, ect).
OMORI is a creation made by Sunny's subconscious to repress trauma, be stronger, have no fear, be brave, popular... Pretty much OMORI gives Sunny what he always wanted (for example, he tries to give Sunny Aubrey even if it's just in HS. He's pretty much the king of Sunny's mind and his own personality himself to the point of being able to take over Sunny's body on certain circumstances). Saying they are the same it's like saying Steven Grant and Marc Spector are the same persons just because they share a body, they are different persons living inside one body
I think sunny is ravenclaw
Sunny’s evil persona… Voldermori!
I fucking knew Sunny would go to Slytherin. (All though I haven't wanted any Harry Potter lol )
This is the first time I could say Sunny just like me fr fr
Lmao, I'm from slytherin. (fr, the official test on pottermore \[not pottermore anymore) said so) Snuuy being relatable...
no fuckin way sunny would be anything but ravenclaw. . i mean look at him. . he looks bri'ish, and that's a criteria for ravenclaw, you either look british or australian. . . . >!(/hj)!<
And why's my boi Sunny in Slytherin? He should be in Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff, anything other than Slytherin!
Honestly Sunny fits way more Ravenclaw, he's not really that ambitious or anything. Ravenclaw is known for intellect, creativity, originality and curiosity, which fits Sunny way more imo
I think you've made some good points here, but there are a couple of factual errors that should be addressed, mostly in Section 3.. . 1. You cannot judge a character (other than Sunny) based on their Headspace counterpart. Stranger and Headspace!Basil are Sunny's memory of Basil (i.e. Faraway!Basil), and Sunny is an unreliable narrator. Just because Stranger tries to guilt Sunny over the truth doesn't mean that the real Basil ever did anything of the sort.. . 2. Assuming you're talking about the scene at Basil's house on Three Days Left, Basil doesn't show Sunny the photo album, especially since it was in Sunny's possession. IIRC, it was actually Kel's idea to go through it. Basil is also not the one who removed Mari's photos from the album; that was Aubrey.. . 3. I don't think it's fair to judge Basil for actions he took while clearly suffering from a psychotic break, i.e. >!stabbing Sunny in the eye!<.. . 4. This is probably the most minor one, but Sunny and Basil were 12 at the time of the incident, not 10. I don't think that really changes anything that much; >!staging a suicide!< is pretty messed up no matter how old you are.. . This last one is a little more speculative, so I'm not numbering it, but I don't think Basil *could* tell the truth first. I agree that >!staging it as a suicide!< is completely on Basil, but Sunny is the one who actually >!killed Mari!<. Regardless of his culpability, it's still the direct result of Sunny's actions. And that's what motivates Basil: a desire to protect Sunny.. . Basil doesn't want to believe Sunny did it, so he tells himself it was something behind Sunny, but deep down he knows Sunny is the true culprit. He's terrified that Sunny will get in trouble (legally or otherwise), so he covers it up. If he truly believed it was something behind Sunny and not Sunny himself, why would he go to all that effort? There's a lot of cognitive dissonance going on here. Anyway, my point is Basil can't come clean first because he would be throwing Sunny under the bus.. . Basically, I think you might be putting too much emphasis on Basil >!staging Mari's death as a suicide!< and not enough on Sunny >!accidentally pushing Mari down the stairs.!< Don't get me wrong, I think the plot would have been very different if Basil hadn't done that, but it seems like you're understating Sunny's role in his own trauma.
Thanks for the corrections, I played the game in its entirety but I forgot some key details by the looks of it.. . The thing about Basil "blaming" Sunny is that I don't think he intentionally did that - but Sunny still FEELS like he is. Obviously this could just be a sign of guilt and therefore nothing against Basil himself. Sunny of course, deep down, knows what SOMETHING represents, so when Basil says "Something" pushed Mari, Sunny is reminded that it was really him who did it.. . I just think Basil isn't as goody-two shoes as everyone thinks he is. He's definitely weird, and learning about his past BEFORE the Mari incident would be a huge deal for me. I want to know how he ended up the way he did.. . I think Basil might potentially have anger issues as well, which he tries to cover up with his soft demeanor. It's just a hunch with basically no evidence behind it, but I think it would explain some things.. . At the very least, Basil has some sort of dark secret that he keeps covered up, just like Sunny, but I think his secret is more of a personality that he had repressed long before he met Sunny.
Thank you for this comment. I'd also like to add that it's been proved that basil has issues with abandonment and (I believe) decided that the staging would be the best way to help sunny in his situation without outing him in fear that if anyone found out sunny wouldn't be his friend. Basil obviously has a connection with sunny since he takes mire pictures of him than he does anyone else, which would make sense why he wouldn't want sunny to leave him.
That's a good point. Also, since when does Reddit let you reply to comments that are more than 6 months old? I haven't really been using it much lately.
Oh- idk-
Basil basically knew the truth the entire time and could have told anybody at any time. He just has the irrational belief that it wasn't Sunny that pushed Mari but "something behind" him. He's got a bit of a twisted side to him like that. He also could have tried to reach out to Sunny sometime during those four years, but in fairness that could be said of most of Sunny's friends. It is commented on some in-game, when Basil mentions that he keeps burdening Sunny in the mental section before uncovering the truth. I wonder how Basil reacts to Sunny confessing, since really it implicates him as much as Sunny. The >!secret ending!< implies that it's positive, but still.
He could have told the truth but that would mean ratting SUNNY out and he thinks he'll be arrested, he hasn't really matured at all since the incident
It started because of basil because basil represents the truth. He is the only one other than sunny who knew what happened. Omori is the one who sent him to black space in the first place to hide the truth from sunny. Sunny’s conflict in both worlds existed because he killed Mari and made a world and omori himself to hide from the truth to the point of forgetting Maris death entirely and him constantly being in a loop almost discovering the truth then relapsing. It wouldn’t matter whether basil hanged mari or not sunny would have still gone through a similar conflict
The hanging is not 100% his fault. Sunny did helped him, you can see him carry Mari to the backyard. It's more like 75% his fault if he was the one with the idea or even 50% since Sunny never objected to it anyway.
I disagree, Sunny IS a saint here. He didn't do anything malicious on purpose. He got in a fight with his sister and pushed her - absolutely, totally normal behavior for a kid his age. Due to the way he pushed her and possibly her bad leg, she fell and landed in a horribly tragic way.. . I know saying "(character) did nothing wrong" is a meme, but I really can't think of anything Sunny REALLY did wrong. You could argue locking his feelings away and turning to escapism was wrong, but that's a normal response to trauma. Basil is weird and creepy and did disturbing things that he didn't have to do whatsoever.
Bruv, Sunny didn't voice out his issues and worries and instead of telling Mari or if he is scared of herd then his parents and friends about not wanting to do the recital anymore HE BROKE HIS VIOLIN which first off is expensive as hell and secondly all of his friends spend so much time to buy it for him on his birthday. This caused the fight between him and Mari. Secondly, Sunny himself actively choose to help Basil frame it as a suicide, Basil did not force him; trick him; lied to him; or threaten him to do it, it was Sunny's choice and depending on the choices in the game he is willing to keep that secret to his grave even when he saw how badly it effected the group, he sees this whole mess and out of about 8 routes in the game only ONE of them he tells the group the truth. Lastly, it is unfair to excuse Sunny's actions while holding Basil on a pedistole of a crazy, weird, and creepy guy, they both did something wrong, they both panicked in that situation, both of them experienced extreme trauma from and as a result of this, and they were both 12 when all of this happened.
ah heres something sunny did wrong. . he was an accomplice to hiding a body, and hid manslaughter. . 👍
The thing is he certainly has mental issues imagining a demon behind sunny,his fırst idea being covering it up,screaming in panic ,obsesing over sunny     "perfect just like sunny". . "Why are you staring at me like that?" . . "Stop struggling sunny" like wtf basil
True, I would've liked for omocat to have explored more of basil and sunny's relationship before something happened and just how much does Basil truly care for Sunny. . Maybe its just me but idk i would've liked to have seen how close they both were to each other before shutting everyone out. . But also i feel like with Basil worrying that Sunny would get in trouble could be because he couldn't truly grasp the seriousness of the situation (considering Sunny kinda did and was mega dissociating during then) and then it finally hit him when he looked back but by then it was too late? Idk
“Yo kid come into this soundproofed room with no cameras there’s idk uhh cake or something in there just get in the room”. . SUNNY Used PEPPER SPRAY. . “Ah my eyes what the hell was that fo- (Springlocks go off) sh-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA”
(I'm not the only one who read this in his dsaf voice
Sunny stabs William Afton with a pizza cutter
Sunny doesn't want pizza, Sunny is totally apathetic
Sunny become a bear robot
the sunny behind the....wait
bro it doesn't matter how fucked up Sunny may be Purple Guy is probably going to stuff him into a Chuck E. Cheese  . now give **Sunny** the knife in this situation and.. well... to be totally honest my bets are on Sunny.
SUNNY used STEAK KNIFE!
SUNNY uses PEPPER SPRAY on MATCH. . "AUGH NOT AGAIN"
omori au where purple guy kills sunny instead
And then SOMETHING traps purple guy in ultimate custom night
What would most likely actually happen is Sunny not trust Afton so he just give up and look for someone else.. . If Afton really wanted sunny dead for some reason he would win because he is an adult with experience.
Sunny is crying child. Thoughts?
Personally I don't think parents knew that it was staged up. But do I think they, or at least the father, blamed Sunny for Mari's "suicide" after they found the broken violin.
i think they connected the dots seeing the wood scratches on her body. on the topic of the violin, didnt basil take it to the closet after the thing happened so that no one would find out, hence, "dont forget its in the toybox" on the back of the photo (maybe in case sunny wanted it back or something)?. . i mean, literally hanging her to hide the evidence but forgetting about the fucking instrument with her hair and blood on it sounds like a dumb way to fuck up
Yeah but when Sunny gets his violin back he is dreaming so I think the blood and hair is probably metaphorical
Never thought about it, sounds like a canont5\31hpy:28941
Canon emote fail 
I don't think they found the violin since Sunny locked it inside the toy box and hid the key in the treehouse
I mean, >!as much as it’s disturbing to think that Sunny and Basil kept Mari’s true cause of death for four years…that’s just unrealistic. Even for the time frame (early 2000s or late 90s), anyone with a brain could determine by looking at Mari’s body that she didn’t commit suicide. So, my head canon is that the police quickly found out, and told Sunny’s parents, but didn’t release it to the public or prosecute Sunny, hence why everyone else doesn’t know, but Sunny’s parents too.!<
But if Sunny and Basil took care to remove the evidence, like removing the wood splinters on Mari and putting the violin, sheet music, and hair in the toy box and such, the only obvious injury might be the broken neck (from the fall) which is also common in hangings, so an autopsy might not be done
I'm not sure about that, I think the game specified that she had light wounds on her body after crashing into the violin, so they might suspect that as well
Exactly, even if the police disregard the body though, they’re going to realize that she had very little reason to commit suicide. Yes, you could argue that her stress and her strive to be ‘perfect’ could be brought up as a reason, but that kinda loses steam when you bring up that she doesn’t display those thoughts through her actions. There’s a reason why Sunny’s friends say,. . . “I just don’t get why she did it.”. . . Because there is no explanation, Mari doesn’t seem suicidal. But…I suppose you could make the argument that *maybe* Sunny’s friends wouldn’t know if something was wrong with Mari, even if she showed that there was…but considering their friend group, I’d highly doubt it.
She could’ve just been hiding it well due to her perfectionism, preventing her from displaying her weakness. It’s not too uncommon for suicide victims to commit suicide even when it seems like life is going well for them
Well…here’s my thing, even if someone tries to hide it…they generally can’t do it very well. I know there’s stories about people who had loved ones take their own lives and they say ‘they didn’t seem different’ or ‘they never seemed suicidal’ or something like that. But generally, that’s because they had a long distance relationship with the person or because that person didn’t pay attention. It’s nearly impossible to keep everything inside at all times, something’s going to give. . . . So what I’m saying is, even if Mari kept her mouth shut and tried to act normal (this being a universe where she ACTUALLY kills herself), I would believe more so than not that someone would notice that there’s something wrong. I mean you have Hero, who loves her and has known her for a long time, or for goodness sake, Sunny lives with her and is her brother, they probably would notice something. They may shrug it off as a hunch, but it would be something to tell police…but in this universe, they have nothing to say…because she never showed anything of the sort.. . . This isn’t meant to say that police could build an entire case around this fact…but it’s something to think about. There’s parts of your brain and behaviors that you can control, and there are things that you absolutely can’t.
Ok, let’s assume that she only got (visibly) a couple of scrapes, the broken neck, and the wounds from the violin at the bottom. You’re going to tell me, that 12 year old Sunny and Basil, who just experienced the most traumatic thing in their lives, were able to clean up every little bit of blood at the bottom of the staircase, clean every trace of blood on her bedsheets, every drop of blood from them carrying her around, cleaned any bloody rags they used, and their hands without leaving a single trace of blood, basically down to the microscopic level, BEFORE Sunny’s parents got home?. . . But you know what, sure, maybe Basil and Sunny cleaned up EVERYTHING…that still leaves minor cuts and bruises on Mari’s body. Even though this is called a ‘suicide’, the police will most likely still investigate it, to which they’ll probably ask about the cuts and bruises on her body, to which the person being interviewed asks ‘what are you talking about’. So then the question leads to, ‘how exactly did she get these mysterious bruises and scars within 24 hours’? . . . I should also mention, if we’re going by today’s logic, the body should be autopsied. So they’re going to find the violin fragments, some signs of head trauma, things that do not make sense for a suicide. . . . Look, it sounds like a stretch to anyone else, but in this line of work, you gotta consider every variable. I’m not saying they jump to the conclusion that Sunny did it, I’m just saying they would question why she has the wounds she has. I doubt that in the world, a faked suicide is uncommon, even in the 90s to early 2000s, so they would consider it even when they hadn’t seen the body yet.
Sunny and Basil managing to clean up everything at that age is not even as surprising as staging a suicide.. . Autopsies are not always done for suicides, particularly if there was no sign of foul play, even today. There might not have been very many injuries besides the neck, or at least not many that could be easily noticed, causing Mari’s corpse to not undergo an autopsy. Even then, if some bruises were somehow discovered, there’s a good chance they wouldn’t go too deep, and considering the fact that bruises and scars found would not necessarily be from the past 24 hours, they might just move on without having an autopsy.. . I’m not going to challenge that if there was an autopsy, there would be heavy suspicions of foul play.. . Also, actual suicides are certainly much more common than faked suicides, so it would probably not have been in mind.
See my other comment
Also, about the ‘signs’ people show. Even if you don’t know what these signs mean, anyone would get the feeling that something’s off. That’s at least something, the problem HERE is that there’s NOTHING (unless Sunny lies, possibly).
If they don’t know what the signs mean, said signs would seem insignificant and they would have no reason to remember them, ESPECIALLY considering that her life seemed perfect and she probably wanted to keep up the look of perfectionism, so her committing suicide would be the last thing anyone would think of. That also means there might be nothing people remember about possible signs since they had no reason to
Look…of course they would, they are her friends and family. They care for her, and want to see her okay. If they noticed something was off, it’s a stretch to day even say that they wouldn’t even ask about it. . . . Look, I’ll bring in a personal example, my own mother. She is pretty much a happy, healthy person, but recently she was going through a bit of a stressful time (nothing huge, don’t worry, it’s good now). She became a bit quiet, closed off…and that didn’t sit right with me. That morning, when she began, I felt something was off, so when I got the chance I said:. . . “Hey, you can talk to me, alright? You can tell me if anything is wrong?” . . . I asked my dad later and he said that she was just stressed and that was how she responded to stress. She did it for a couple of days, and even though I knew what was going on…it still hurt seeing her act different. The point is, if you care for someone, I mean truly care for someone, and you thought something was wrong, anyone would ask that loved one:. . . “Hey are you okay?” . . . Even if they lie, saying ‘they’re okay’…you still would have the feeling. You can’t get ‘rid’ of that feeling, until you know that person IS okay. That’s not a choice…if you truly love someone…you want them to be okay. Sometimes you’re able to act quickly enough to save them…and then sometimes you’re just too late…but the point is that there was something there…and that sticks with you, especially if something like what these guys experienced. But in this situation…there’s absolutely nothing.
What you're saying I believe is correct, yes, but what I was saying is that they would raise a tiny little bit of suspicion over Sunny since it's his violin, but that they wouldn't be able to find much evidence afterwards.
I agree that they wouldn’t be able to deduce that Basil is a part of this, however I think they would start suspecting Sunny. Looking at her body, anyone would tell you that she fell down the staircase, but the real question would be:. . . “Did she fall accidentally or was she pushed?” . . . Now, that would be a bit tougher, but ultimately, it’s just a matter of logic. Whether you think that she died as soon as she hit the stairs or died later in the hanging, there’s zero logic in saying that Mari somehow got up after just falling down the stairs, walked out into the backyard, tied a noose, and hung herself…she had to have been put up there by someone else or have help. Now, we don’t know the exact circumstances that lead up to the accident, but we can only assume that Sunny’s parents were away, leaving Sunny and Mari at home to practice (maybe after school), and Basil came over later and…ya know the rest. The police may not have concrete evidence, but they’d have a pretty good suspicion of Sunny. So maybe I was wrong in the fact that they didn’t prosecute him because they felt bad or something, but because they just didn’t know fully.
But I don't know how they would be able to know that she was ever pushed from anywhere, since Basil and Sunny hid the remaining pieces of the violin on the toy chest. As I remember, the game doesn't specify anything about her having injured that are clearly for falling other than the broken neck (and her injured knee, but her friends and family could testify that she had that before), but that obviously could be from hanging (at least from the game's logs descriptions of "The Truth"). It doesn't specify anything about that. But yes, I think it's pretty obvious that Sunny would be a suspect because his broken violin being in Mari's body, but I don't find any other evidence that could raise suspicion on him. How did she have those pieces of a broken violin on herself? I think for detectives, it's assuming way too much with little evidence that he threw her down the stairs, and that Basil hanged her, with all of the possible scenarios.
Put a spoiler on this post
Hey, I forgot, thanks for reminding me
I played omori, of course I’m crying
what
What?
what🗿
I think they knew, or at least suspected. It would explain why his mom never showed up, she might be somewhat afraid of him because she still doesn't understand WHY he would do it.
I do believe as well that he had some sort of problem to figure out that quickly to think of pretending a suicide after what happened, or maybe not, maybe it was just the adrenaline, the avoidance of consequences and to protect Sunny. But what we do know for sure is that during the aftermath, poor Basil needs mental health help and support for sure, living with his own SOMETHING which is constantly harming him instead of creating Headspace like Sunny and going into denial of the accident, it's just all so difficult to swallow even from a third person's perspective, just imagine being in his position. Poor guy, he deserves way more love than what he gets, and you need a tiny bit of empathy before haters judge him for staging a suicide (which again, I'm not trying to minimize or say that it doesn't matter, because it does), but humans deserve second chances and the possibility of rehabilitation to a certain extent
Bro really turned into matpat making this post
I posted on the same topic yesterday and there was this comment by u/Mart1n192.. . I think thats a pretty good theory on this subject. . 

I don't really understand how they could not.
personally i think during the four years they did NOT know that sunny and basil staged her death. however i believe once sunny came out and told the group the truth at the hospital in basil’s room, it lead to sunny eventually telling his mother, even if it was after they moved to the city (i forget where i havent played in like 2 years 😭). but no yeah they definitely didn’t know the boys staged her death. however i also think once they seen the broken violin at the end of the stairs and then seen mari hanging, at least sunny’s father blamed him, thus leading to him saying “you are not my son,” and then abandoning he and his mother. ||. ||i’m not too sure what his mother thought, but i think to a certain extent she also blamed him but wasn’t as on the nose about it like his father, which i think is also why she never seen him during the three days, because the furniture can wait tbh. but no yeah, there was definitely secret hatred and not animosity, not js secret dissing and pent up feelings from her. also since her husband left and she was led to believe her only daughter committed suicide, she had no choice but to accept her son and the troubles that came with him after the incident since he was the only family she had, and vice versa.
If I had a kid and they did what sunny did, even as an accident, I truthfully don't know how I would react.
Personally, I don’t think they did. I think Sunny’s dad blames him for it considering he was there with her, and not noticing that she killed herself. I think Sunny’s mom probably knew how hard it must’ve been on Sunny but she’s also grieving and trying to distract from it.. . As for the possibility of signs and no evidence to suggest that she would take her own life, it’s possible for someone to take their own life while not displaying signs. I have diagnosed atypical depression, and when I say that my family saw no signs until when I finally admitted I was depressed, I mean it. It was a shock to my mother (who I’m close with and notices little things), and even my best friend doubted when I told her I was diagnosed. Because it never crossed their minds. They never saw that I was depressed. Now that they’re aware, they know to check on me sometimes and they know when something is off.. . So this means it’s very possible that the staging could pass. I’m sure there wasn’t enough evidence to suspect foul play, so the police rule it as a suicide and case is closed.. . But again, just know, it’s possible to show little to no evidence of suicidal thoughts or depression and take your own life.
I believe that Sunny's parents know about what truly Happened to Mari since she didn't showed any signs of depression to simply do that out of nowhere, so i believe that Sunny could have told the truth to his parents making his father mas and his mother sad but forgive him since she still acts like a mother to him                             BUT HEY THAT'S JUST A THEORY                                           A GAME THEORY!! 1!!!
There isn't anything concrete that tells us that Sunny's parents knew his role in Mari's death. The dialogue you quoted is not proof that they knew.
Triple spoiler warning?
Post has already been spoiler tagged
I'd say yes. It's not *indisputably* canon since we're never told directly, but on my first playthrough I thought it was very heavily implied, and after watching a lot of lets plays and doing a second playthrough myself I consider it more than just a headcanon. It's just subtext, but it is still *in the text.*. . Along with the "you are not my son" line and his mom's behavior, to me it just makes the most practical sense. When I read discourse posts from people who dislike the truth/the ending, a point that comes up a lot is that "it's unrealistic that nobody found out what happened + the cops would have been able to tell it wasn't a suicide," and like... I agree? Which is why I think the adults involved *did* find out what happened, but just chose not to go public with it because they didn't want to ruin Sunny's life any more than it already was.. . I also can't think of another good explanation for how Sunny's parents act towards him. "You are not my son" while cutting down the tree is *very* on the nose, as is the odd dissonance between his mom never being at home and leaving her depressed teen alone in the dark because of a *furniture sale* vs her saying she "can't lose him" after Mari's death. To me it reads like his dad left because he couldn't handle being around Sunny after what he did, and his mom didn't want to leave him but still can't really bring herself to forgive him, so became avoidant and distant.. . The specifics of how they found out are rather unclear — they could have walked up while Sunny and Basil were still at the tree, they could have just investigated the body, or they could have just noticed how odd and suspicious Sunny's behavior was when Mari's body was "found." But the details aren't that important imo, just interesting to think about.
The two scenes with Sunny’s parents can go both ways, but I personally think they know. Like the other comment says it’s unrealistic that two little kids staged the scene without anyone noticing. . . Another thing I suspect is the note on the toy box (“Don’t forget it’s in the toy box”) is written by Sunny’s mum. As she was clearing things out of the house for moving, she comes across the violin and wants Sunny to face the truth one last time. This is just my head canon though so if anyone can fill me up with theories on the toy box note, I’d love to know.
I think that after it happened, sunny told his dad, and then with his dad's reaction to it being to leave the family, Sunny was unable to tell anyone else because he thought it would only cause more harm
I'd argue otherwise because that's something very traumatizing to experience and would probably take a more prominent role in his subconscious than just a few lines of dialogue?
"A sad detail about SUNNY". . *And ANOTHER one!*
Considering that Sunny creates Head Space parallels for Karen and Sean (Ren and Shawn) even though they say they're new to town,  as well as other Faraway residents like Michael (the guitar player in the plaza), it's plausible that Sunny actually sits by the window and people watches. But he never goes outside
To me, the mirror is one of the most telling things about this: your friends smile warmly behind you, while Omori stands there, black and white, with a blank expression. He needs his friends, but he feels like he isn't a part of their world anymore. This is also why the Branch Coral refers to the Neighbor's Room—the dream analog of the tree house—as Sunny's most precious place in Headspace.
He also seems to be repressing his desire to go outside like how he represses the swings in the omori route there is no one there but in sunny route aubrey and sunny start to flash up on the seats and it is not a memory because they are in their Real world sprites and even in the duet thier faces are hidden . . Sunny doesnt want to himself to reconnect but he also desires it so strongly that he cant repres it anymore
"One more day the sun reaches my bed. One more day to spend alone again.". . This just makes the ending extra bittersweet.
I feel like he does it to keep him from feeling good. He doesn't feel like he deserves to feel good, so he keeps himself from feeling anything positive, not counting headspace because Sunny keeps his association with Omori very separate, it shows that he definitely distances himself from being the same person.
SUNNY, walking past a mirror: Good Morning, OMORI.. . OMORI, taking the place of SUNNY's reflection: *G*o f*u*ck *y*ou*r*sel*f*.. . SUNNY: Same to you.
LMFAO. . Take my free award.
Imagine if Sunny was such a big fan of BCS that he tried to have his life be like the show.
Hi I'm Sunny McSnuuy, did you know that you've serious mental issues?!?!? The fandom says you do, and so do I. I believe that until proven the opposite, every man, woman and child in this country is depressive. And that's why I fight for you Faraway Town
Garden shears are a unique weapon, they have two different stabby ends. It's possible his target was with the right shear, a couple inches to the right of Sunny's face ^((notably a place where Something likes to float)), and his left shear just perfectly\* hit Sunny's right eye.. . \*besides the blood and ^((possibly but unlikely to be temporary)) blindness there's nothing to indicate how much the shear actually caught his eye I don't think.
Well, there's still a hole in Sunny's eye-socket.
>Something must have shrinked it's eye by about 5 times.. . This is the part I was responding to. Wasn't disagreeing with the other part.
My brain is melty.. . Thanks for explaining it, i guess.
Basil thought there was no way out. He wanted it all to end. And when Sunny entered his room, he saw him and Something, and he wanted to kill Something to end both of their pain. But he didn’t realize that Something was actually just Sunny
Wait this is what I understood- Like he was about to kill himself to protect the truth/Sunny (and sad for his grandma) but since Sunny was here he wanted to take both of them to run away from the truth again - This is what I thought
An imaginary relationship with Sunny his sleep paralysis demon >:D
- Sunny. - Sunny. - Sunny. - Sleep paralysis demon (Sunny)
Maybe a female option for Sunny? I believe that was supposed to be an option.
Doubt it cuz the original female sunny design had pigtails
I also saw something about Female Omori in last resort.
It's in the game, you have to do Medusa's side quest in the last day in the hikikomori route and then she'll give you a potion that you can only drink underwater, after you drink it you'll get pigtails on omori's pixelated sprite
I have a question that s for a different cut content, is it true that there was a scene where polly and sunny would talk alone ?
I think so! I'm not too sure though
Ok thank you
That's basically the way I see it, but I see Hero's reaction being slightly more vicious.. . Kel is Kel. He'd obviously be forgiving.. . Aubrey holds Sunny very dearly, even after everything. I think it'd take a ***LOT*** to make her truly hate him. Sure she'd be mad at first, but I feel like she truly changed after the events of Two Days Left. She'd understand what he was going through, because she nearly killed someone in a burst of emotion herself.. . Hero... he was way closer with Mari than Sunny, or that's at least the way I see it. Not that he wasn't close with Sunny either, absolutely not, but... come on, Mari was practically his girlfriend. Like you said, four years he blamed himself, tortured himself thinking about what could've been done differently. Looking for something to blame. Four years of complete, utter, absolute hell.. . And then he learns that, all along, it had nothing to do with him. That it was ***all a lie.***. . I don't know what he'd be more furious about, the fact that he essentially suffered for nothing, or that her name was ruined like that.. . But either way, he would be so mad that the first thing I'd see him doing is running away before he ends up doing something... ***hypocritical.***. . It would take him a looooooooooooooooong time to cool off. I think once his initial burst of rage died down he wouldn't exactly be hostile toward Sunny, but he definitely wouldn't be friendly either. Too much was taken from him for him to just accept the truth that quickly.. . But that's just me.
>!Yeah, Kel would definitely be the quickest to forgive imo. He was the one who continued to act happy despite everything, as you said maybe because he wasn’t as close to Mari. But being with Sunny after so long, then hearing him shakily confess as he stands there in his hospital gown and bandages? That hurts Kel, but not because he’s angry. He is sad to see that Sunny (and Basil) have been in so much pain and he couldn’t do anything. But more than anything, he’s just relieved that Sunny trusted them all enough to finally share his story, that he’s finally letting everyone in on his emotions.!<. . >!I agree about Aubrey. I always imagined she’d be like “how could you…” in a shaky and angry voice. And just as Sunny is about to try and apologise, she yells “how could you deal with this all by yourself?” then launches herself at Sunny. She’s mad ofc, but she’s more upset that Sunny held the burden for so long and she’s upset at herself for undermining his pain the whole time. She had been focusing on herself and was mad that Sunny and Basil hid away, but now she realises why they did that. The incident of pushing Basil is fresh in her mind, so to imagine how Sunny must have felt for killing Mari, the blame he must have put on himself for ruining the friendship everyone had? Yeah, that hits her like a train wreck. She’s angry; but more than anything she’s mad at herself for blindly criticising Sunny instead of considering things from his perspective. (If you couldn’t tell, I am also a Sunburn shipper lol.)!<. . >!My theories about Hero kinda change a lot, but usually fall back to him being quiet and conflicted. Yes, he cares deeply about Sunny and he knows in his heart that it was an accident that Sunny made as a kid. But as you said, he has spent years trying to figure out where he went wrong. Of course it’s a huge shock to suddenly find out he did nothing, that the whole thing was a stupid accident. There would be conflict in his heart because he can see Sunny is in pain from this and he knows it was an accident, but the fact is that Sunny killed the person he loved. I imagine while Kel and Aubrey are hugging Sunny and crying with him, Hero is quietly fighting wars in his head. I really like your idea that Basil is the one who notices Hero’s anger - subtle, but it’s there. And yeah, ofc Basil would be upset and scared if he saw that. Basil blames himself just as much as Sunny does, if not more than him. Basil is the one who framed it as a suicide, which is why everyone was left so confused. Maybe that look of terror reminds Hero that whatever pain he felt, it was probably nothing compared to the guilt and trauma Sunny and Basil experienced and that they were still just kids who have had to deal with this whole situation alone. I imagine him joining Kel and Aubrey but being very quiet for a while as he continues to process everything.!<. . SORRY THAT’S SO LONG AND RAMBLY ;;
Ah, im so happy to hear you like my theory! You said everything here very well, and very descriptively! I dont take my words as gospel in any sense, but this is what feels both the most normal and believable to me, given the games tones it was setting up and the established personalities of these characters. Thank you very much!
Glad you liked my ramblings lol
Ah, thank you! I do hope i didnt imply that hes forgiven or accepted what happened here. He has far too much in his own head to wade through in my idea of the scene. He simply realizes that his friends need him, that sunny needs him in this moment, and set aside his qualms to comfort them all. Thank you very much for the input!
Yes, I agree. Maybe we’ll meet again, with new ideas to talk about. Until then, have a good time!
Hey, you too! My dms are open if you ever feel like discussing!
I also like to think Aubrey would be forgiving because what Sunny did was an accident, and she almost did the exact same thing to Basil. She pushed him in a moment of anger, and he almost died. If her friends weren't there to help he would have. Sunny didn't have anyone to help him
Sunnys mom
Well, I’m calling it, Sunny’s looking a little sus.
>!Mari: "Sunny, what the hell are you talking about!? You're scaring me!"!<. . >!Sunny: "Shut up you sussy baka! I saw you vent!"!<. . >!Mari: "Basil, do something! Help me!"!<. . >!Basil: "Idk, seems pretty sus to me. I say we put it to a vote Sunny..."!<. . . . >!𝙼𝚊𝚛𝚒 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚊𝚗 𝚒𝚖𝚙𝚘𝚜𝚝𝚎𝚛!<
Sunny must transcend space and time being able to say Sussy Baka in the late 80s/early 90s
Pretty sure it's early 2000s but yeah
Maybe, but the new game console showcased in Hobeez was an SNES that came out 1993
Honestly, I have no idea why it was Omori and not Sunny.
I assume they mean Omori and Sunny since they're technically the same person, and didn't use Sunny's name either. . A: To avoid spoilers. . B: Because Sunny's name is player chosen. . or. . C: Both
Yeah, I don't really know how it works, either, but I sort of assumed that by Omori they meant Sunny, or the MC in general. It's just that his very existence is kind of spoilery in of itself, hence why when Omocat releases the birthday chart on her Twitter, Sunny's birthday was advertised as Omori. So if that's the path they're doing, then I damn hope that this stellar silent protag in all of his wonderfulness gets picked. It probably won't happen, but it would be great. It's been almost four months, and I keep reflecting about aspects of Sunny's psyche, myself. There's just so much going on.
If Omori wins in the Compelling Character category, is Omori going to pick up the award himself >!or is Sunny going to do it for him!<?
Yeah, It might have been Because I was going for the "Sunny Route" and the game does indeed shift randomly but I still expected it to be Mostly horror considering that's how many described it.   . It might also be because my expectations might be too high but I don't know.
FOR AUBREEY and sunny
Sunny.
Can we talk about how >!Omori succeeded in this save earlier than in the Hikkomori route? He singlehandedly changed the outcome of the adventure and sealed off Blackspace, preventing Sunny from discovering the truth.!<
And all he had to do was… take the L…
Sunny would love that
**Yes**

I can understand him because I'm spanish. And it's 'Tengo que decirles algo'. 'Decirte' is for second people, 'decirles' is for third people.
Thank you for this! This fact might help me, since im trying to learn spanish
Cómo anda el aprender compa?
What did he say?
Tengo que contarte algo
Alright I’ll use Google Translate then
Google translate wont work as it'll translate that phrase to: "I've to tell you something", this is ok for english because you know the "you" is plural, but on spanish it should say "tengo que decirles algo" so it reffers to everyone in the room.. . "Decirte" is singular of "tell you"
no it actually translated to “I have to tell you something” no joke
no, its "Friends... I have to tell you something."
Oh right I forgot the “Amigos”
Isn't the original line in second person?
Yeah, in plural. You can use the third person to talk about the 2nd person in plural in Spanish. . It's more common in Latin America
Ah, that's right. Usted is usually used for plural and it conjugates like third person.
There is a fanfic where Sunny confesses but for some reason the only thing that could come out of his mouth are piano noises *plin plin plon*. . Fic Name: "plin plin plon"
*Sunny walks in, takes a deep breath, and prepares himself as his friends look on*. . "Plinn plon bing bing bong bing bing bong bing bing pling plon - pling pling plong - pling pling plong - bum ^bum ^^bum - pling pling plonnnnng - brrm brrm brrnnn"

Mmm, I wonder who wrote that fanfic.
Hmm yes I wonder who. . . Btw how are you m8?

Before you know it there's gonna be an AU where Something curses Sunny so he can only speak in Luigi Gibberish
Tengo que deciros/decirles algo* (depends of the type of spanish)
I can just imagine this with the loud bang as Sunny enters the room and the classic text to speech spanish voice
bro, i'm new here on reddit, and want to post an omori fanart here, but for some reason whenever i press the pics option only white squares appear... does anyone know how to solve it? I'm on the mobile

Funnily enough, I have an AU where Sunny moved to Costa Rica after everything that happened with Mari dying and he developed an accent after learning Spanish.

Sunny is stuck at home, sunny is from omori, kel is from omori
OP here: Just imagine you're Sunny, >!well adjusted, having grown up to be as healthy as one could be after everything that happened, and he's on his way to work as a well-paid graphic designer. Then somehow, he stumbles upon this body pillow sale, and he sees that someone made a sexy body pillow of the main villain from his adolescent fever dreams, and that it SOLD OUT. I...I think the poor guy would go back to never leaving the house.!<
The real question is how did they got the image of how exactly the villain looked like
I imagine he briefly gets internet access to our dimension and sees this and only this.
Sweetheart was a mascot for the candy shop in Sunnys world

That is why I send anyone who ships sunny with anyone TO THE GULAG!!!. . There Communist Babil will save this community
Lol, babil became communist
A ship a believe. . I'm gonna take a wild guess and say the ship is Mari x Sunny. . Edit: Is Hero x Sunny, not that better ngl
If this is true, does that count for sunny to
Probably but I'm not the deciding factor for that.
“Sunny, I’m stuck!”🤨. . “Omori, I’m stuck!”😨. . >!insert elevator joke here!<
>!Gardening shears x Sunny's eye!<
I think they aren't actually pictures, but they're represented as such because of how sunny sees pictures as memories and represents his memories like that
Well he *does* say he only takes photos of people when they least expect it.
yeah but this is funny
"An empty white room.". . This implies Sunny over time adjusted White Space to be as suitable for him as possible

He was the one who caused that sunny's mom and polly become hated and forgotten in the sub
My last playthrough also was on Sunny route. When I looked up quests in Faraway Town, I realised how much I've actually skipped when I played for the first time.
Ruining the gang's lives. :(. . . Normally with video games that have multiple routes, I try to play all of them. OMORI's probably the first one where I don't want to do it because the idea of making a file (or files plural) where Sunny and the gang's lives gets ruined is just... :(
Ik, but he's the "antagonist" of the game, also ya know he pulled a knife on sunny and nobody can do that but sunny, that's his thing
There's no "antagonist" in the game though. No one in there is "inherently evil", everyone just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The game itself is literally about how you shouldn't blame something on just one person and to forgive. . Also the knife thing, are you talking about the >!basil fight at the end? Because I mean those shears were meant to be for his own gut but Sunny decided to walk in and then they both started hallucinating so!<
 racist Sunny confirmed?
unfortunately for me it was animation of sunny's confession but i didnt see the eye so i was kind of good ig?
Very very unfortunately I had already seen the last duet video and a video talking about omori lmao. My friend got me into it a couple months after.
Why are you obsessed with Sunny's mom?
"Sunnys muum has got it going ooon!"
\-, 2001
sunny can't you see that you're not the one for me!


Wait a minute…. Ew lmao
you “befriended” sunnys mom :trollface:
Just like Sans befriended Toriel! Right? RIGHT?
Yeah, aren’t pro-shippers saying that Sunny “befriended” his sister/Mari?
Nah you're lying. RIGHT?
RIGHT?!
No.


&#x200B;. . 
:Then we shall do battle!
You know what, I get it. I agree.


He wants to be Snuuy's new dad
>!below the collarbone, in front of the ribs!<
. . oh and if you make one more posts about sunnys mom ill start a fucking war
Not another war 😭
they made the post. . and its a bootleg of one of my old powerpoints. . 
~~Coming from a game about forgiveness, acceptance and learning that mistakes does not makes us monsters, fuck Sunny's mom and dad, actually fuck every parent on the game for not being perfect.~~. . ~~-Pikachamp8108~~. . &#x200B;. . Edit: I just read everything now, this time more carefully, and I'm here to inform you that I fucked up big time , there won't be no damage control I suck at those.
It's all good
Lol, unfortunately I really don’t think we have enough Sunny’s mom stans in here to make this a reality. But maybe someday, if she somehow ends up gaining a huge fanbase!
dont make me make a poll...you cowards
Do it
WHY are the mods such bullys 
Sunny's mom is a holocaust denier
You can get away with being this edgy? I feel like if I try it once I’m going to get banned
Idk I felt like it. I see where u coming from thou. Ive gotten away with saying omori is a KKK member
none of us are perfect
You’re down bad bro
Oh heck naw you're down too deep 
OP needs to find another.
Kanye fan???
I support this. We need a Sunny's mom flair.
hell yea 
Nah. . Opinions on Sunny's mom are still mixed and she's just not that important.
>**Give them food they can actually microwave?**. . she had food sunny could eat, sunny just choose not to eat it. . &#x200B;. . >**Not let them rot in their room for four years?**. . she actively tries to tell sunny to go out to see kel, but is cautions due to his mental state . . >**maybe try to talk to your son?**. . she tries too, sunny distances himself . . >**like dudes 16 now he definitely hasn't been going to school**. . she was probably homeschooling him

pin what’s up with u being obsessed with sunnys mum?
I really want a sunnys mom for uhmmm…..reasons
Ohhh...we have a Noriaki Kakyoin between us, it seems
Sunny mom is overrated
I’m replaying the SUNNY route so that I can play 1 day left and do all the things again.
Same. . . I still need to fight the recycultist. . . And get all the flowers.
Sunny won't come out, guess I gotta call 'er
Sometimes r/omori feels silly and uses snuuy to snuuy communication instead.








Prolonged exposure to the Snuuy is highly dangerous to demons and other evil creatures
Snuuy
Will Jesus forgive Sunny’s sins? . . (Yes)
we never see sunny ask jesus for his forgiveness so technically no 🤓
Damm the same year sunny was born
Omori subverts the reforms, Sunny gets sidelined and Omori now finally has a place where he can spend at for the eternity.
> chainsaw BRRRRRR. . Oh no >!Sunny's dad!< came back, this time thrice as strong
Oh no.
THE FINAL BOSS. . DOMESTIC ABUSE
What is this referencing ?
That one >!Black Space!< key room with >!Sunny's dad cutting off THE tree!<
no way Sunny is being compared to Shinji of all people
They have similarities.
I suppose but Shinji's character is more shaped by loneliness, self-worth, and the burden of responsibility in a high-stakes scenario. and on the contrary, Omori embodies the psychological turmoil within Sunny, reflecting guilt, trauma, and escapism. They do share a fair amount of similarities in someee ways I suppose..But Stillll Its Shinji 
They are normal looking guys, who play similar instruments and that needs to accept themselves, in Sunny's case by forgiving himself and in Shinji's case accept himself as person (that's before the end of Evangelion at least). I was not disagreeing with you, I think too that Sunny is way less mentally unhealthy compared to Shinji.
ohh yeaaa Shinji does play a very similar instrument 🎻
Bro is Bigger version of Sunny both Physically and Instrument
Shinji is instrumentally bigger than Sunny
They both are focused on trauma and escapism. That's the whole message of the original eva series: Escapism = bad.
they both did bad things in a hospital
That's not true Sunny only had something to tell. Unless you mean the bad ending.
They mean the bad ending
Sunny, crank that Soulja boy
>But while Sunny is fucked up because of an accident cause by the stress caused by his sister's perfectionism Shinji is just fucked up by his own. . Incredibly terrible take that you know isn't true because it's contradicted by your own follow up statement
Damn, my bad sorry. I wrote this between school lesson. I wanted to say that even with those he isn't justifiable for me
I have putted it in an horrible way
I'd much rather be in a room with Sunny rather than Shinji.
Sunny would just stand there (doing nothing) Shinji would just stand there (doing something)
okay but like people don't actually think that's something shinji considers normal right like they realise why he did it right
Doing WHAT?!!?!111!?. . /j
. . too late
In shinjis defence, he’s been manipulated by absolutely everyone around him and has absolutely no concept of right and wrong, as a result. Not saying that makes what he did right, in any capacity, just that it gives some insight into his actions
Maybe it's Autumn break mod, maybe the 168 ost Omori alter lyrics (or 169 I don't remember) or else but I do not agree with most of the things this person said. But we all agree that sunny is at least partially inspired by Shinji Ikari. . . . Like in this picture
I mean, this photo was 100% inspired by eva
Sunny is nowhere near as mentally fucked as Shinji
Sunny literally has not left his house for four years, lol.
not to trauma olympics or anything but Sunny's suffering is not comparable to Shinji's at all 😭🙏
tbf thars what happens when you compare a (somewhat) grounded story to something like evangelion
Shinjis trauma is so much worse than sunny’s i’m gonna be so deadass. . Sunny: Killed his sister, had an absent dad, stayed in his room for four years . . Shinji: In the tv anime alone >!almost killed his best friend because of his dad, has basically all of humanities lives on his back (He has to fight the angels like every few days), and a lot of other stuff as well that’s kinda blurry cuz i haven’t watched it in a bit!< in end of evangelion he >!Watched someone he deeply cared about get ripped to shreds in front of his eyes, litterally caused the end of the world, and has to live with legit only asuka who now hates him!< and in rebuild 2.0 (i haven’t watched the 3.0 or 1.0+3.0 yet) >!Almost killed asuka, and caused the end of the world!<
I haven’t even heard of Shinji once in my life. . But this is just outrageous.  They don’t even know it was an argument and Sunny didn’t mean to push her down the stairs, nor that it was confirmed she died from the fall.
He's from this famous anime called Neon Genesis Evangelion, which had a big influence on OMORI (e.g. WHITE SPACE is an Evangelion reference).. . I never watched it, but all I know about Shinji is that he's VERY mentally unstable and shares some similarities with SUNNY.
Oh is that where that man looking down sitting in a chair meme comes from
Yep!
I might need to watch it
. . please do, it's not that bad. the story was a tad bit confusing for me, so if it is for you when you get done, just watch a yt video or something.
I really recommend it, but please don't rush it, take your time, rewatch an episode if necessary, because it can be a bit complicated at times
sorry to barge in and ask this but.. how old are you, guys? It is just so rare (at least for me) to find people who don't know who Shinji is or haven't watched Eva, just curious!
Omori fanbase is zoomers bro
I'd rather not share my age, but I have too much going on in my life to even consider committing to any series. And even then, I barely watch anime :P
It has to be the first, Sunny isn't the textbook definition of an asshole
Bro forgot about how much Sunny regretted it, bro assumed it was calculated when Sunny has THE FACE OF DISPAIR ON HIM AS HES REALIZING WHAT HE JUST DID, bro thought Mari could've been alive and didn't know about Sunny putting her in bed.
one of the most fascinating things about omori is that we don't really know what mari was like at all, aside from her surface level positivity-- the only people who know her well are sunny and hero, and sunny's view is obviously all kinds of distorted, while hero just doesn't talk about it. we don't *know* if she politely (though sternly, judging by the pictures' body language) talked to sunny out of concern or if she was mean. she could've gone full LTG on that kid for all we know
Sunny its been 4 years you have to let go
If you wanted to put a gender on a manifestation of trauma, then I suppose something would be female!!. . And I have no idea how or why people are breaking rule 2 regarding the manifestation of Sunny’s trauma and guilt over the accident 
Same…
catboy maid sunny
Nothing wrong with that there
The thigh-high argument kinda baffles me because the game itself can't decide the length of Omori's socks. In the >!Sunny and Omori hugging!< animation, they are above knee, on some other art, they are below the knee.
Schrodinger's Legwear
OMORI is a dream, and dreams are inconsistent, so it makes sense.
That argument should have settled that Omori was only black on the bottom half of his body and wearing white leggings
Counter argument, not funni 
Ok sorry then  I apology deeply for my mistakes, I Hope I, as a human being will be excused for being such a trashy person at a moment when I thought my comment was funny while it wasn't, please forgive me even If I'm a worthless piece of trash that wouldn't even belong in the junkyard... 
. . It ok


. . Tysm
They’re a child stfu
the fact that youre getting downvoted is... concerning at best
What’d he say?!
Probably something that violates rule 2. Use your imagination
Because Sunny is a bit more expressive and not stoic 24/7, he acts more shy and traumatized. For Aubrey she acts more aggressive and swings her bat (I don’t think she actually hits them, more as just a threat) and her resentment towards Sunny is clearer in the manga. . . I’m honestly glad that we depth about Sunny and Aubrey relationship when they interact the least in game.. . Idk, people seem to complain about everything.
It makes sense for Sunny to be more traumatized (after all the events of the game) and Omori more stoic since OMORI is Sunny’s idealized version of himself.
If it’s sunny sunny and not sunny in his head to be more expressive, i don’t see where this is a bad thing. Like sunny is surely more expressive even in the game, though it’s hidden behind the graphics so we don’t see it
I always thought there was something off with the way they drew SUNNY in particular, aswell as that one scene where OMORI and SUNNY are together was very uncomfortable.
I thought I are talking about me. (I drew an artwork, where Sunny has a panic attack on the staircases and named it "Don't be afraid, Sunny... Your sister is here" (This is the most evil thing that I did))
The lore expands.. . Also no wonder pin got banned, everyone hates Sunny's dad for some reason, >!and it ain't for the incident reason!< c'ause they do be assuming him to be worse than Adolf Mussolini and homophobic before >!the incident!<,so yeah.
This sub reddit is getting some deep juicy lore
Someone needs to record it, I'll start with **The Era of the 6 Ones**, this shit gonna be Skyrim lore level. (Edit: I don't know shit about The Era of the 6 Ones so it might be a bit short.)
Cant wait to see it 
Actually I'm going to need a list of names, I know about Bubbly and Sigma8K but I forgot the rest of them, can you help me out?
Id love to see a documentary of this on YouTube. PLEASE DO IT, FELLOW BRAZIL MAN >:3
Well, I did a post where the mods removed it for "breaking rule 1".
sunnys hotter to me
my fella respectfully that's a 12 year old
hes 16 but ok
Wait what? I thought he was like 12 during  the game.
omori is 12, sunny is 16, they are separate. omori is sunny in his dream world, and sunny is the real guy  . i love sunny
Why is sunny's face so damn goofy
No it's fine. That's Omori not sunny.
I went to the other weekend dressed as Sunny exactly like this, even with the eyepatch.. No one recognised me.. Two people called me Kenaki Ken.
Time to end you with a [BIG SHOT] Sunny, since you won't [bites the dusto] by jumping off the roof.
Well… it wouldn’t be so easy if he just handed over control to Sunny, now wouldn’t it?
Sunny develops a chronic fear of stairs and takes the elevator whenever he can

Could you imagine if this was canon, and Sunny was just (and still is) going crazy?
POV Sunny post bad ends
An AU where bad truth end Sunny noclips into an alternate universe where everyone’s fine and they work together to stop Sunny from consistently trying to kill himself

That Sunny does seem a bit suspicious.... . Maybe he's committing identity theft?

OMORI feels HOMOPHOBIC
well said. I'm really sorry you had to go through all of the things you did and it's so good to hear that you've found some solace in Omori!
Hey, this comment may not be relatable to omori or may seem insensitive, but how do you overcome being a hikkomori? . . . . Actually refuses your feelings and thoughts are incredibly difficult, I understand that at least for one bit, I've been a hikkomori for almost three years now. I'm on and off to my urge to kill myself, having suicidal thoughts everyday, but can't talk to anyone about what I really feel because of the stigma and being very ashamed of myself.. . . . I couldn't get out of the house without thinking of what the others will think of me, having a panic attack everytime I'm trying to wear a mask, because that actually means that I'm actually going out. People eyes, their stares, what will they think of me, they freak me the fuck out.. . . . Talking to a therapist isn't easy either. The questions they ask was like breaking me down with a hummer, their judgmental words are breaking me. . . One wrong word? They'll threaten you to send you to an asylum. One wrong step? You'll see your mother crying when she come out of the room.. . . . I always yelled at myself for why I didn't kill myself when my father told me to when he give me a noose four years ago, why continue to bring suffering for your family when you clearly know your existence is and will continually be a burden.. . . . . Don't get me wrong. I have a reason to live, one reason to live, yet it is severely unbalanced to reasons to die.. . . . So how do you get over/or trying your best to stop being hikkomori? Any answers is fine, I'm sorry for troubling you by my long, unnecessary and unsympathetic comment.
I don’t have anything to add to this but holy cow your father is human trash. What sicko gives their kid a noose and dares them to use it???
Yes, I think that is the only time he called me a "good daughter" when I took it. He told me before that my existence is unnecessary, that he didn't expected nor wanted to have a third children. There's multiple times he told me to kill myself, but that's the only time he actually give me a tool to do it.. . I'm also sorry that I couldn't give more details, rethinking of it is already making me suffocate, go on about more details, I'll just have nightmares about it. I saw what happened when I'm dreaming, as though watching a broken, hazy clips. Sometimes I couldn't figure that if it's real or it's my imagination. Maybe that's why I related to sunny a bit too much.
Hey, first of all I want you to know that you are so fucking strong to get through what you have, never think that you are weak or bad because you are amazing just surviving through that.. . I don't know how old you are but getting out of that toxic environment will help you immensely. Also I would try talking to a doctor about medication, you don't have to tell them anything that would have you put away but push for medication that will help control your panic attacks and disassociation. I would also try and take little steps in going outside, maybe start just holding your mask for a bit, then getting ready to go out but not going. Get comfortable with the idea of going out and then go on little trips just outside, not nessisarily go anywhere and always feel okay to go home.. . It is a long process that won't always be a straight line out of it, I've relapsed into hikikomori plenty of times but through experience with my panic disorder, medication, and support from my mother and partner, I've made it out.. . The world is far better with you in it and you will get better to see it too.
Try not to push yourself, recovering from trauma can be a complicated, long term process. I could recommend some reading that has really helped me personally, as someone recovering from CPTSD.. Widen th Window by Elizabeth Stanley. From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker. Both are great starts. I wish you luck on your journey
Whoa hey this is a lot to take in...and a lot for you to go through. Thank you for sharing all of this. Ive been a hikki for almost 2 years but this summer i had a sudden change in my thought process (currently fighting hard to not go back to hikikomori ways). As cliche as it sounds the answer is confidence/stop caring. This was my thought process:  . . . 'I dont want to go out, people will see me and judge me...' -> 'If anyone judges me just for existing then they have nothing better to do with their lives' (kind of harsh sorry) / 'I dont care what people think of me, i live for myself not them'  . . . About talking to others/your therapist being unhelpful, it usually helps me to post what im feeling on reddit or to write it down on paper/in my phone notes.  . . . I hope things get better for you...please hang onto that one reason to live...
Nicely well written thank you for your perspective
I'm so sorry for what you passed through those years...I hope you're feeling kind of better after all of that..This is nicely written and it's nice that you found a deep and beautiful meaning for you in OMORI! (I actually don't know what to say, if this kinda uhm hurt you in some way, I'm sorry-)
It's okay. I'm in a much much better place now. I would consider myself non hikikomori for just over 5 years now. I have medication that works, brilliant friends, and amazing partner that I plan to marry on day, and I'm doing so much better. . I wrote this to just put into words what I was thinking about, it doesn't hurt so don't worry, thank you for you comment. 😊
I'm glad you have all of those people who care about you and that you are feeling much better now! Also, you're welcome! :)
Thanks a lot for your pov, and I'm sorry that's how things went for you
There's a lot of things wrong with it.. . And I haven't seen that face before from Sunny (?), and thank goodness I haven't. That looks extremely creepy.

Just reminds me of the hørny sunny meme
Hehe, you know you need to send a link of that meme to me now that you said that right?. . 
[here]()
Ah I’ve seen it. . Thanks anyways 
Mhm.
This is secretly a fake image made by Sunny because he is HOMOPHOBIC. . (jokes jokes)
Why is Sunny's dad so angry and why him and Sunny's mom is literally in the ground?
idk I just found this
is this a Youtube video? Or did you play it in the video
Twitter vid lol
Link?
hold on
hold on to what?
. . . Twitter moment
Thank you! 
np
I don't have a Sunny to make it the real duet sadly.. I would've cried as well if the violin was there!. . 
I mean, you are sunny, the one you want is Mari
Sorry sir, I like your tier list and I respect your opinion, but 100 sunny should definitely go higher
100 Sunny
I think it actually might work more for Sunny, but I dunno 
Sunny jar of flies sweeps always
real
I can see that, but if we establish that Sunny likes Post Rock than I feel like he would most defiantly have Godspeed You Black Emperor on his top albums,>! because of the consistent use of the violin.!<
Nah man I already gave Sunny LYSF when I made a aux chord meme
Why does Sunny have that Lily of The Valley Album?
Snuuy. We can both appreciate how the SERFS WORK THE GROUND! AND THEY GIVE IT ALL THEYVE GOT!
NOOO SUNNY WITH IN CASE I MAKE IT NOO
Sunny cuz neutral milk hotel
So many of my favorite albums on Sunny's list. I'm so proud of him 🥲
Ok what is that last album by Sunny? genuinely curious
Lily of the Valley by Cecily Renns! its a super cool omori fan album made for a super well written alt universe fan fiction (also titled Lily of the Valley)
Sunny, because. . # SEE HOW THE SERFS WORK THE GROUND! >:)
Sunny is definitely listening to Amnesiac by Radiohead and Put your arms like antennas to heaven..
Man if only Sunny was this good
none of the in game events would've happened
The "oh yeah sue me" made me laugh.. . I imagined Sunny sueing Omori.
He could, omori's been living in his brain rent-free for 4 years
>!This is what Sunny heard during the drop!<
LMAOOOO
>!That means Sunny died at least 50 million times!<
: omori, I’ve come to bargain. . 
>!Sunny explaining how it’s okay now that he pushed his sister and killed her because she came back as a ghost in his mind to play a duet to destroy his alter ego!< 
Sunny’s most genuine defense for his actions in court 
You may see some not-so-smooth cuts here and there, that's because this isn't actually the full version!. . Check out the [full 4-minute version on YouTube](), would appreciate it, kindly! :D

sunny the water was literally a block away
QUICK SUNNY TYPE /GAMEMODE 1 PLEASE I BEG YOU
Sadly, he's in hardcore mode...
MY GOD THIS IS FANTASTIC
This is probably the highest effort meme I’ve seen on this sub and I’m actually upset it isn’t getting more attention. You did a great job!!
bro the cover is strangely accurate to the original, good job
Thanks! I used multiple references when making this since some piano tutorials I reference are lacking in some parts. Pretty content on how it turned out.
I saw the CLOTHES flash-
Mari didn’t destroy herself? The whole incident happened because she overworked Sunny because he wanted to do music with her. She was perfectly fine overworking herself. She’s the type who enjoys practicing over and over. Is it healthy? Probably not. But she was far from destroying herself. The only problem was getting Sunny involved in it. Which DID start with Sunny getting into violin but also I was obviously joking about that.
>!\*Something runs closer to sunny\*!<. . >!\*Kel, Aubrey, and Hero disappear\*!<. . >!Sunny: I WAS NEVER FINE!!<. . \[Inspired by the original post by [Shady Attab]()\]
I say its the one after it. The polarity between the sweet sounding violin (sunny’s hope) versus what is pretty close to death industrial (omori’s despair) just hits so, so deep.
a funny thing i thought about the "56-12-2" OST. In japanese, the date is written starting from the year, then month and finally the number of the day (basically the opposite way of european dates). Looking the date on Google (2 December 1956), i found out that it's the day of the Granma Ship landing in Cuba, an event of the Cuban Revolution. It was funny bc i thought that Sunny was related to that event somehow
You think that's bad, I'm 19 and Sunny is taller than me
Me too
Me 4
If sunny wasn’t malnourished he would have been 2m
To be fair, I’m pretty underweight myself, but not to the degree of Sunny, I always imagined sunny was about 5’ 5”
That's hilarious to think about, Sunny had to nerf himself so the others didn't feel short.. . Imagine him eating like, one proper meal and shooting up an inch.
And then imagine him using his latent fighting skills and mastering a martial art like judo
He does boxing or mma and just kicks ass. Sunny's skills are actually perfect for somebody who fights alone, he can heal, self buff and cheat KO damage. He could actually be dangerous if he were in better shape physically and had experience fighting.
So your saying he’d be like sagat mixed with eleana, yeah that be a nightmare
im 16 and im 5/0 i get it i didn't go outisde for 2 months but that's nothing compared to sunny who isolated himself for 4 years, fuck logic and my family genes
I’ve grown a year older since I made this comment. . . Im still the same height as sunny. Fuck.
I feel your pain
I need to really get some meat on my bones. I’m not as malnourished as sunny, but I’m definitely scrawny af like him
Yeah and i should go outside a little bit
I’m not even allowed to go outside in the day cuz everyone says it’s too hot lol
Oh
I’ve grown a year older since I made this comment. . . Im still the same height as sunny. Fuck.
Well i was meant to have a real sister but i ate her in the womb, so sunny is literally me fr fr
I too ate my sister in the womb, didn't even spawn lmao !
Spawnkiller smh
oh god..
I understand being hungry but who the hell eats their siblings 😭
I didn’t have sentience, just primordial hunger
"ooga booga me hungry me eat sibling" 🧐🍷
It wasn’t really eating, more like just absorbing them
Slay
You just fused with them. Whether it’s dragon ball or Steven universe fusion is up to interpretation
Its closer to metal gear solid, because in reality i was absorbed, its just that my superior genes took control
I want to see an anime fight between you two in the womb.
The Scarlet King
You mean grimm from hollow knight?
Scarlet King from the SCP Mythos
Oh
Ur not you when ur hungry
sunny is taller than me and i don't know how to feel about that
He ate raw steaks and slept for 3-4 years i dont know how you should feel about it either
my comment's a year old what are you DOING Here
Dunno I’m bored and going through old reddits 🤷
So basically the same height as Sunny. Interesting…
Since we have Sunny's height you could probably try using that one photocard where they're hugging maybe?
Can you send a link to an image of that card? Iirc, there was a photo of Mari and Sunny hugging that took place before the 4 year timeskip.
[Here it is on the Omori fan wiki](). We had the same one in mind, though I didn't realize till now that since the photo album was from before the 4 year gap their heights might not be the same. But I guess we can proportion scale this Mari and Sunny to present Sunny?
i hate how sunny is taller than me
If you are a girl you are not short then
Then just accept your height because its not something you can change too easily
Don’t listen to this man. Buy the tallest stilts you can find. Become the tallest you can be. Forget Sunny or even Kel; from now on, your height nemesis is the Empire State Building. If your head hasn’t passed the stratosphere, then you aren’t trying hard enough.
Abandon your limbs. Go request Molly to make you upgradable robolegs that can make you taller to infinity and beyond.
Western girls with atleast 6'0" standards: "You're too short little guy, go bother someone else your size". . . kekw (this is just a joke dont sue me)
Sunny has them tall genes if he's still somehow average height for a 16 year old boy despite his bad lifestyle choices. >! If there was an au where Sunny didn't isolate himself through his own choice or a different person dying, he could've been taller than even Kel or Hero. !<
>! Well Sunny was strong enough to beat up Basil bad enough to put him in the hospital after getting his eye cut out, so I’ve always just assumed Sunny was a Chad that just needed to eat healthier. !<
Technically not. Omocat drew a picture of an everyone lives AU and Sunny was still shorter than Kel and Hero.
Oh yeah, that.... Aw man, he had no chance, but it seems uncanny that his shirt has a self portrait of him with the signature something eyes.
they're all wearing omori merch i think
To be fair, the game is set in the US and the height standards are MUCH higher compared to where I live. Its not really that weird that he's 5'7" since he got them caucasian genes, in fact isnt that kinda short?. . I myself am a shortie 5'7 too at 19 years of age. I probably would have gotten to 5'9 atleast if I didn't starve myself eating only once per day simultaneously depriving myself of sleep and much needed sunlight due to me staying indoors and reading Visual Novels 16 hours per day in my adolescent years. Well I'm Asian so I guess 5'7 isn't that bad, I've seen guys at 5'3 in here but maybe thats just my personal copium lmfao)
ITS OVER FOR ME PLEASE HELP.. . kekw
It's weird to think that Sunny used to be the tallest of the twelve year olds despite being the youngest.
I REFUSE TO BELIEVE SUNNY IS TALLER THAN ME
I just realized that I’m an inch higher than Sunny
Sunny couldve actually grown to be one of the tallest in the group if he didnt malnourish himself.
Avoid everything omori related on the internet, always open the door  and keep your name as sunny (although this is probably too late)
>! Headspace is destroyed? I thought it's just that Omori died, so there was no alter ego to go to Headspace for Sunny !<
the most effective way to heal is to spam calm down with sunny but nobody else can heal up in a way that’s really substantial
>!with the power of air resistance, sunny now flies instead of falls!!<
This is the roof of the school. He must be flying around looking for the hospital roof
YEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!
A lot more limited, very few >!Black Space 2!< rooms can be visited on the Sunny Route
I keep forgetting sunny can't get happy.

Ironic considering the word sunny could possibly also be a description of someone happy and energetic lmao
ngl i find it funny how sunny can just go home on one day left like "fuck this shit im out "
im goin to bed 
Nah I'm satisfied with seeing sunny rekindle old friendships
Chances are you've seen the doll in the room on the left end of the 2nd floor of the Last Resort. I didn't think much about it my first playthrough, but this time I chose to drop the doll in the trash can and listen to the telephone three times each (every time you walk out of the room the doll reappears on the bed). Now the telephone part may or may not be necessary, but doing so 3 times leads to the doll (who so far had no face) having a face and clothes very similar to Sunny. Listening to the telephone reveals that the raspy sleeping noises that you could hear previously are actually coming from the doll (it's noticeable with headphones).. . Anyways, that's what I discovered recently!
im playing the game the second time now, and im going to also do this when i get there, thank you :D
that's the point. . you become sunny
Oh no not this static stuff . . I remember spending a lot of time in BS 2 after getting there the “secret” way in the Sunny route; especially this location. It gets quite overwhelming, after a while.
Same here, I wanted to explore a little more, but now I can’t move. Tips?
I mean, I basically just continued despite it until I couldn’t anymore (I felt I’d explored enough) but I never literally froze. If you are frozen (if this is possible), I know to leave you are able to pull up the menu and stab, right? . . If I recall, the static is also less intense in certain places. I think that weird version of Otherworld is one of them. I think leaving to that place or other “rooms” and coming back may lessen the effect, to an extent, but I don’t remember it getting much better. Generally my memory is a bit fuzzy as it’s been a few months.
…it never occurred to me to stab, thanks.
From what I can see, it looks like you found one of the secret (Sunny-route specific) entrances to BS2. If possible, I think that the best thing to do would be to open the menu and stab yourself. Hope that helps! :)
This advice out of context would certainly be concerning
Sunny is having his revenge today fuck now i want spaghetti
Found Sunny's reddit account
solar eclipse is beyond illegal ngl
It's just Headspace Sunflower, though. Not a healthy relationship, but not an illegal one. . . I *guess* you could claim that since Omori and Stranger are both figments of Sunny's mind, Nightshade is technically Sunny x himself... but that's a bit of a stretch.
Not jugding but, why tho?
To add to the list, Sunkissed is Kel x Basil x Sunny.
agreed, but everyone calls it sutan so..
WHY IS MARI X SUNNY IN THIS POST
Damn having a map like that woulda been really nice when I 100% that route
Looks like my notes for the Let's Play I'm doing. I have a big appreciation for hand written anything these days.
Also, sorry for the poor quality 
this is adorable op
Hyperrealistic snuuy
Well, the problem with the happy effect is it increases her chance to miss. She may do more damage but if she misses one, Sunny may able to perform his shove attack before his stress level reaches 10. Judging on Sunny shove attack sets the enemy to 0 HP no matter what, the best case for Mari is to be angry so she doesn't have an emotional disadvantage and she cannot miss. Thank you for listening to my game analysis. Any feedback on my analysis are welcome.

AI generated comment
I suppose it's just pure fiction. She thinks it's the best place for her Tamagotchi (Sunny) to live with his friends, far away from the troubles and struggles of the real world. The word "Everbloom" just highlights the idea of her creating an utopia for Sunny.
And I guess she thinks of Faraway's plantations as ever blooming with flowers, unlike Sunny who thinks of it as vast. Also, she may associate a forest with blooming flowers as a good place to hang around with her friends, imaginary or not, which can have roots in Hanami (花見). Once again, we loops back to Mari's imbedded Japanese heritage lul.
Oh, damn, on one hand I agree, but on the other — since Sunny, just like Mari in the original, will be following us, it wouldn’t make sense for her to create only one utopia.. . It could be that she’s making a location for each member of the group, with this one belonging to Basil (at least I think so, since Hero has his own cafe / Twitter post).. . Or you’re right and it’s just an invention based on Sunny’s drawings or the book from the trailer, *“The Playground in The Woods”*… After all, it’s one big forest, and among it there’s also a playground (0:45 – 0:50).
Thank you for your comment. Solid takes, mate. . You could be right about the locations dedicated to each character. However, I doubt the forest is Basil's, because as you correctly pointed out, there are big hints that it's just a book. Even though they may have their own spaces, the overall setting revolves around the sun. So, Sunny would probably like the idea that the headspace contains something of everyone — Mari would assume the same, hence why we may see this idea in the mod.
Its like diffirent personality and knowing the fact that probably it hurt her so much killing his own brother that watched his growing by her own hands she probably had so much damage compared to sunny that his innerself designed white room as some kind of hoobys books and everything that can keep she can forget sunny
late to this but hes not TRYING to kill them (or so he says), its just that the disease Sunny is infected with is fucking up his head and making him do stuff he doesnt want to
Dude I made this comment months ago
i know, i said late
Yeah but it kind of doesn’t change the fact how jarring it is to see someone reply to your  comments you made months ago lol
sorry
What is omori.exe about anyway? Is it like some sort sonic exe type stuff? Whenever this mod pops up, I always imagine Omori >!rejecting Sunny healing from his trauma and not needing him anymore!< so he manifested irl and started killing everyone or something
I’ve noticed that HIKIKO is very protective of SUNNY, and SUNNY seems to smile a lot more then he would she also seems to notice any small thing inconvenience him like in the bee siege teaser
Sunny is pretty much despondent the entire day, but he's also just plain loyal.
Damn, Sunny villian arc real
He doesn't. Fists are equipped during this fight, actually (need to fix that,) but Sunny attacks in order to "move him out of the way.". . Sound familiar?
Why not use animation of Sunny pushes kel away
I don't have a pushing animation.
Make one
I don't know how to
Its simple animation
That I just can't do. Maybe down the line when I'm more experienced with that stuff. I can always re-visit it.. . It's literally my third day trying to mod. It's my third day trying to even use the engine.
Ok
For what reason does aubrey want to get sunny out of his house? in the original story she would not do it herself. and also while i was reading the dialogue, i thought if maybe someone told her (maybe basil did) about the idea that sunny might be soon dead. and that's why aubrey is so determined to get sunny out (and that's why your mode doesn't have a hikikomori route)
I mean, maybe? I really put it up to interpretation, honestly. I don't like diving into specifics when it comes to story line stuff.. . Short answer; I didn't think about the why.
Wanna squish her cheeks
I didn't play the bot but wait her? Is dreamer Sunny female?
Can you rephrase that?
I had some typos sorry. I haven't played the dreamer mod but is the "dreamer" who looks alot like sunny is female?
I have not played it either
pocketsized wonam sunny
where is this from?
in the title, in the brackets, it says "OMORI: THE DREAMER", its a mod
oh my bad! I got distracted by Snuuy's cuteness
is this after the part where you collect 27 pages 💔 i quitted after that way too time consuming
it's literally the second one you can go to, right after the scripted and forced entry into one of the houses, going from the left, the first pinky house
damn.
Neat!
I thought the mod stopped at green space
Sunny with eye twinkles continues to be blessed.
Anyone notice how >!Sunny’s *right eye* is closed in this picture? !<
Sunny's pinwheel color is white. I think the blue pinwheel is Hero's. We can tell this because in front of their house are the colors they match them. During the game which pinwheel are where are based on the relationships and state the characters are in. (Ex. Current day Sunny's house only has the white; while in the flashback there is both purple and white.). . also I do hope that Rainy Mari has the "subconscious elements" that omori has as well. I really like that aspect of that game.
In Rainy Mari, Sunny's pinwheel is confirmed to be cyan. This is best shown in Rainy Mari's [Mari Christmas tweet](). If you notice, each character are sitting on mats of their respective colours, aside from Aubrey who is dancing. Aubrey is with pink, obviously, so no worries on that. That leaves Basil with green, Hero with blue, Kel with orange and Sunny with... cyan. Hikiko is now the one being represented by white mat instead. This may be subjected to change though, as in the image above which I captured in the 2025 trailer, Hikiko seems to be represented by the purple pinwheel again, since there is no white pinwheel to be found.. . In the base game, you may be aware of the Hangout Spot in the real world which has a checkered blue picnic mat as well as a picnic basket with the same pattern for its cloth covers. Perhaps before the incident, both Mari and Sunny were the starters of picnics, though Mari may did it much more than Sunny because well... Sunny is kind of autistic lul. Irrespective of that though, Mari and Sunny seem to have their own colour preferences when it comes to picnic mats. Mari likes red, Sunny likes blue.. . At least, those are my thoughts on the matter.
>Then again, why didn't Hikiko paint the basket blue?. . In the same trailer, on another picnic scene that only has Hikiko, Sunny, Basil and Hero, the basket is blue. The basket is also blue in Bee-Siege, when we see all members of the Faraway friend group. Either it is an oversight by the developers, or it is intentional.. . If it is intentional, your suggestion of it being an allusion to the sun sitting in the blue sky can work. Another thing I think said detail can symbolise is Hikiko's bigger agency in these picnics, as now it is not only Sunny who manages the picnic. Hikiko may participate in preparing for said picnic, probably by preparing food and snacks for said picnic as indicated by the red basket, whereas Sunny plans out where the picnic is going to be organised at and when it is going to be organised. If these two scenes are connected, it can show us either an increase or decrease of Hikiko's responsibilities organising those picnics depending on the chronological order these picnics occur.
That is a good theory indeed, and I did come to the same conclusion in another comment I made above, that the blue picnic mat and basket are Sunny's. And this theory does play into the fact that Mari views herself as a big threat to Sunny's wellbeing after the incident (she pushed him to suicide via emotional damage I think), and Basil as Sunny's closest friend who is able to keep Sunny safe from various threat, except for the threat that was Mari, or to be specific, furious Mari.. . Also, your English is great dude.
Maybe it's Sunny's picnic mat, I think, with cyan and blue colours being assumed by me as Sunny's preference.
I can’t wait to play Super Omori 64
Staircases mention. Deploying Fun Staircase fact: the staircase in Sunny’s house has 15 steps.
Thank you for the staircase fact!
 "La-la-la, hm-hm hmm!"
Now I'm imagining the start screen where you can drag parts of Sunny's/Omori's face around the screen, but the facial expression just... never changes.
Why is there a "Big Shot" button
This is the high quality content I love about this fandom
Whatever happened to Sunny activated Mari's autism on spiders
>!I have heard of a fan theory that Mari put the spider on Sunny, which was why he jumped into the lake and almost drowned.!<
Wait, really? Where did you hear it from?
I have a feeling he's part of the development team
Just been on r/Omori for way too long for it to be healthy.
Wait, this kinda makes sense actually. Like, she didn't want him to climb the statue; so she scared him out of it.
As well produced as mods and fanart etc. is, it's all just fanfiction. So I try my best not to let this stuff (and you should also) color my views of the canon character behavior.
Now would it be in-character for Mari to distract Sunny while she put a spider on his shoulder and then after hearing the brothers calling him to join them for a swim, he unexpectedly rushes towards the lake statue before she could reveal the joke? . . Probably, but that's as far as it goes.
I didn't realize this was a mod for a sec and thought a sequel was coming out
Oh Hell nah Sunny took 25 Benadryl
That's a cool concept, Sunny actually interacting feels weird but right nonetheless also after the fight he'd keep the knife so every interaction since then would be completely different. He coming out on his own is also pretty cool, you should continue this 
So one one's taking a knife from him? I like the idea 
I like this... continue cooking
Yes. Please continue, I'd like to see where this goes.
i need this one more than a water
Pathing issue. Already fixed it.
If we look at the trailer, we can also notice at 0:44 — 0:50 that, although it’s realistic (which shows that Mari is older than Sunny and her imagination works differently, but we already knew that). It still feels too childish.  . There’s literally one big Disneyland for Sunny, plus candy growing on trees and, strangely enough, cartoonish enemies.  . All of this seems to hint that, even though the world belongs to Mari, it still revolves around Sunny — kind of like a reference to our heliocentric system, with the Sun and the Earth.. . It’s possible that after Sunny’s death, Mari became fixated on him and on taking care of him in Headspace.
I mean, that is kind of confirmed in Bee-Siege with how laser focused Hikiko is to Sunny, wanting to satisfy his needs no matter how minute it is, like getting honey on toasts for example. And in order to have a Headspace of her own, she probably had to borrow some of Sunny's most beloved characters and landscapes within his vibrant sketchbook he left behind, which kind of explains the similarity between Vast Forest and Everbloom Woods lol.
Lol i thought this is sunny’s house 🗿
I mean, some section definitely shows Sunny's house lol
i do not have a screen recorder so sorry about that
What’s the infamous Sunny chart
. [this]()
7th tier emotions when
check out blue channel for seventh tier emotions
Blue channel?
Sunny legit turned into sans for a moment there
Without spoilers, it takes place after the good ending, where you pass out before saying the truth, falling into a coma and exploring a new dreamscape with new characters and content. Sunnys main, goal is to wake up from this coma, and tell the truth, while his dream is trying to stop him from waking up. The ending had me in tears!
Sounds good, but idk if i want to see a continuation of the story tbh.
There are a 2h demo of this mod. Try this demo and if you like it try the prélude
As someone who played it on release it was fire
Is there a way to change the MC's name without having to manually go through all the new dialogue and change it myself? i've gotten the game to call me toby via editing the save file, but now it just feels like no one else got the memo LOL. . I'm gonna assume the answer is no--- which is fine, it's not the end of the world and i understand the mod is for everyone, plus i also don't know crap about coding or modding anyway so take anything i say with a grain of salt--- but i'd still like to say to anyone who's thinking about making OMORI mod(s): Please try to remember that he's not 'Sunny' to everyone. The base game lets you decide what his name is for a reason :') Part of what makes OMORI such an amazing experience to play is how immersive it is
Sunny has an omor
I’m. Sorry but Is that EMO SUNNY????
Cut my \[Photosphere\] in two pieces, this is my last \[Chromosphere\]! 
😭😭
IG the game is now emori(that can be a good mod-)
Not a mod mate. You just so happened to play when Sunny was having his emo phase! You have the only known footage of it! Good job!
I think you might have forgotten to uninstall the mod. Leave him be though, hollow sunny never hurt anyone
Yeah, as a certified SunBurn shipper, I don't think Pink Tinted Love does much   . I've seen gameplay of it, and it's more of a romanticist fanfic and it goes way into detail about stuff for no reason through dialogue between the two.. . And also, like other people are agreeing to, I do think Sunny talks WAY too much, he's not exactly a chatter box--
I agree with Sunny talking way too much aspect, I think it would have been cool if Aubrey helped Sunny talk and head open up with each chapter. I do wish there was more choice, though with a mod like this I don't know how they would implement any combat. I think the hair dye detail is cool however. Aubrey also feels way too nice in the mod.
Ngl I love it for all the reasons you hate it lmao. The dream sections dont really make sense for a more fluffy mod like ptl which focuses on romance, and havinf Sunny be quiet would just turn this into an Aubrey dating simulator, which would suck balls.
“How dare this mod set out to do what it intended to do!”. . You know a decent amount of OMORI mods don’t implement combat and for good reason? At best, this mod isn’t your forté, which is fine, but hate seems like a lot for something so harmless.
I am n unot offended by a mod, i just say that i dont like it.. No. And my problem is not the lack of combat, is the lack of aby gameplay at all, is just a visual novel but all the choices you make are tottaly irrelevant, at that point, just write a fanfic
Where would there be combat? It's a post-truth story that takes place in the real world, there's no place for that sort of stuff. It really feels like you just don't like story-driven mods, there's no need to be weird about saying "just write a fanfic" when this is an equally valid way to tell a story
It does not need to be combat so there is gameplay, they could, for example, give you actual choices fos sunny replies instead of two different buttons that does not reflect the actual dialogue and give the same outcome.
Those reasons you listed are the exact same reasons why I love it (Except for Sunny talking too much, but I got used to it after a while). . I don't really like Omori's gameplay, so I love it when mods decide to ditch the battle sections and just give me a interactable fanfiction
So...  You dont like rpgs and just endure the gameplay for the history sake?
No, I like rpgs to some extent. But I've played Omori for an unhealthy amount of times and it gets so tedious after a while
Its just like a dating sim
Yea but at least in some dating sims you actually have choices
Someone made a less than favorable quality mod/fanfic?  Who could have possibly predicted this
It's basically an Omori asset flip with the sole purpose of shipping two traumatised kids.
Interesting idea! A unique one for sure, I'm very curious to see how it turns out! (Good luck with development!)
Thank you so much! The story overall is still a bit wonky, but we're getting to it. . (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠) 
You, DREAMER, play as SUNNY, a jackalope bunny.. Aside from having your friends that were on your side on the long and seemingly endless journey once, three new people join you.. . . At your hangout spot, where MARI resides, you can change between the characters and a day/night cycle. Certain characters aren't really... meant to be out in the sun.. ^ idea ^
I’ll take a look into this AU, I wouldn’t mind assisting with the writing!
That's so great to hear! Would you drop your discord user in our dms?  There isn't much, aside characters posted at the moment, because I can't concentrate on one thing NIWNDB
Absolutely!
I adore revmori so so much! I'm so happy to be contributing to the mod and I adore the fact that my oc is included!! Yippee. . . . Fairy Sammy says you should apply and help out as well, if you can! <3
FAIRY SAMMY MY BELOVED
Broken Spaces Sunny: Man Rainy Mari feels easy, is there anymore more challenging then her  . Hikki & Exori: pulls up  . Broken Spaces Sunny:. . 
sunny your sister did not die in vain
: this tastes pretty good guys. . >!👁: you should give it a try Sunny!<
WAIT WHY WASINT THE EYE CENSORED WITH THE REST OF IT ON MOBILE THAT MADE IT SCARIER
A mere spoiler tag cannot contain SOMETHING 

BRO THE SOMETHING CENSOR
I don’t know if I like the idea of OMORI still being inside Sunny or standing by his side more for this, they both have just the most comedic implications
 \- “No no no, SUNNY! It couldn’t have been you… It was the Grimace Milkshake wasn’t it?”
Another thing I despise is when the fandom portrays Sunny as a soft, depressive, incapable mute. There's way more to him then that, he's intelligent, he's creative but also a pretty hard worker, he jumps directly into danger to help his friends despite being weak, and not even that weak either. He's snarky and teasing in his own way, he's easily frustrated and gets VERY angry, and despite all these traits he's a genuinely good guy who will go out of his way to help strangers. He's got a shit load of character despite never speaking a word.. . There are a bunch of fics where Sunny is some kind of badass or just way OP. I dont mind them, even if most people find them annoying. But now I unironically prefer those kinds of fics, because at least watching that Sunny is actually entertaining, rather than watching a stunted mute with little agency get walked over and almost never actually stand up for himself.
Yeah a lot of people take sunny at surface level, and forget we literally get a full-on deep dive into his brain if you know how to interpret the subtle things in his dreams
Like the bit with the keyboard in spaceboys room. If yoy interact with it as Omori, he trys to play the white space theme, misses a few notes, and after a few moments trying to continue he gives up and smashes the keys, hinting at his short patience, plus Sunnys angry portrait looking downright enraged, even leaning into furious.
Exactly what I'm talking about
Thank you for fucking pointing that out. Really points some parallels between Mari and Sunny and short patience for inconveniences. (You all know what I mean)
the only issue with this is that sunny's own perception of himself is black and white, both literally and figuratively
I'm just going to keep this in mind so I can headcannon Sunny better.
Yeah, that's actually a good idea. I'm writing a thing where I'll want to be able to write him well, as well as the others.
Good idea
You can also see more of his personality shine when checking things in the house after the fight when he’s describing things.
Yeah, he's quite sentimental, always remembering a little detail for everything in the house, he clearly cherishes his good memories a lot, even if he cannot go back to the way things were
The true Sunny lies somewhere in between
Correct
hes only weak because he >!did absolutely nothing but sleeping and eating in his house!< but he gets some of the best skills in faraway
If we actually could see him from another perspective in the game, he would probably be my favorite character. (though the game would 100% not be omori if that was the case)
I remember seeing a fic where Sunny had a gun instead of a knife.
Literally Doomori
He has Ron energy, he would silently do things impulsively, without any form of critical thinking, only to lay in bed later that night and ask “why did I do that”
The most valid Sunny is absolute fucking goblin child sunny tbh. (In Which Sunny is bad at Naming Things)
Well he does for the most part act like that in the game, so it is not surprising then why people would make him extremely boring in their own fanfics. Honestly I hate mute Sunny in both the game and fanfics, it makes no sense. Sunny is a great character that has depth and this depth needs to be explored in fics or Aus in my opinion.
So the fact that a character is mute is boring? There are real people irl who are mute. Are they boring too?. . Sunny has a lot of depth, but him being mute in the game is clearly due to his issues as a whole. Just ignoring the fact that he's a young boy who had a traumatic experience, and already kinda seemed like the quiet type.. . It's true sunny isn't just a soft mute boy. He does have a personality beyond that. But saying that he should be talking in the game when he's not just depressed but actively disassociating himself from reality and a quiet person at heart, i mean.. it's no better than those people who reduce him to soft mute boy, you want an aspect of his personality gone.
I have never in my life meet a person who is mute, but I would probably have a hard time hanging out with them if I needed to. And also Sunny is not mute, he is intentionally not talking throughout the whole game.. . So Basil has a traumatic experience as well. He doesn’t stay mute for the entire game and he was fully conscious through out the whole tragedy. Just because you are the quiet kid doesn’t mean you don’t talk at all.. . The only thing I am saying is that being a silent protagonist makes no sense in any way. He doesn’t have to talk a lot he can still be the real overly shy kid. But him not talking at all makes not even feel like a person (not in a good way).
Selective Muteness is a thing, and it's not just a conscious decision not to talk. Sunny's inability to speak lots of the time seems to be a genuine aspect of his trauma.
Fair enough I guess, I am just talking about the situations where it is clear that his trauma is not taking any effect on him, like with Aubrey at the lake or the situation at Basil’s house at the end. I am not understanding why he doesn’t talk there. I fully understand why he doesn’t talk while he is fighting his phobias or when he is in Headspace as Omori.. . P.S: I am aware that muteness can happen with trauma, all I am saying is that it still makes for weak character development as I don't see how Sunny acts like a good friend that everyone describes him as.
those specific scenes are when he's still very much in his day to day state of never talking, before he's gone through the major strides to overcome. Omori also represents the way he handles his trauma- with a neverending stoicism that suppresses emotion, which is part of what his silence is. When he finally speaks in the good ending, this supports the mute angle even more, as its meant to be a sign hes overcoming his trauma and is ready to get help.. . &#x200B;. . I don't actually headcanon Sunny as mute, but it's one of the more reasonable and understandable headcanons out there. . &#x200B;. . edit: Muteness does not prevent you from being a good friend. both aubrey and basil describe that Sunny is a good listener. He provides emotional support, and his friends understand him despite him not using one way to communicate. Also the dude can write.
I dunno maybe I just find mute Sunny as a boring human being and maybe that is the problem I have with it. But I appreciate your answer. I just don’t see what his friends see in him in order to support him after leaving him for 4 years and the muteness doesn’t really make his character at all compelling, as he does basically nothing in the real world to help his friends, it is basically Kel that gets their friend group back together not Sunny.
I'm not sure what you would see out of him if he wasn't mute, in that case, but I understand the sentiment
Thank you for your understanding. Maybe I just have a really weird perception of what I expect Sunny to be.
Basil is >!~~gay~~ Suffering from extreme mental trauma, and his 'devotion' to Sunny is born from a deep rooted fear of being alone, resulting in his breakdown when he is told Sunny is leaving. He can't handle not having Sunny around.!<
i don't mind if he's gay but i don't like shipping him with sunny after everything that went down between them. both of them need years of therapy first
Basil is really only seen as feminine because he likes plants and wears flowers in his hair. Also, he isn’t even implied to ever have been into Sunny romantically. Hell, >!during Memory Lane, Basil giggles when he realizes that Sunny has a crush on Aubrey, so he’s shown to basically be fine with who Sunny wants to be with. His obsession to keep him safe comes from his deep friendship with Sunny, not because he’s in love with him. There are people who exist who will do anything to keep someone safe, but not because they love them romantically.!<
That alone doesn’t make him gay, but him being overly attached to Sunny doesn’t really help his case either.. . He’s got no canon sexual orientation anyway so I don’t see what the problem is.
lmao exactly. and it’s not stereotyping if he just happens to be feminine. the OMORI fandom headcanons EVERYONE as queer. i’ve seen SO many different HCs for all the characters, and so rarely has everyone all been cishet. y’all are reading too much into this . - sincerely, a feminine ace, gay, trans guy.
Most of those adjectives don't even remotely imply that he might be gay. If I described my dad as a simple modest man that is generally speaking confortable that doesn't mean I'm gay for them. Perfect can be interpreted as something that can be gay but it could just also mean that Basil sees sunny in a very good light to the point where he refuses to see his flaws. This is confirmed by the lines he says in his fight where he vehemently denies that sunny is responsible for the truth and that it was "something behind you".
being very attached to sunny, bordering on obsessive, *does*
Ehhhhhhhh, seems more like out of a fear of being alone than of a romantic attraction
that's fair
That doesn’t mean he ISNT gay for sunny tho
Him liking sunny kinda cancels out the point behind the devotion, he did the things he did for sunny just because of a crush? Really?
while i disagree with the idea basil is gay in defense of the people who think he is. they have more argument then basil haveing feminine quality's the lengths he goes to help sunny far past the point of normal healthy or legal behavior as well as his dependence and attitude around sunny  suggest to some he might feelings for sunny. now i and others disagree with this but i feel dismissing the idea and reducing there argument to something so simple is unfair and a reductive. not trying to call you out just trying to offer an alternate perspective
he's not gay because he is femenine he is gay because of his idolisation towards sunny and the way he acts towards him, his dependence and a lot of other signs
But thats ruins the entire plot twist?
he’s not even a femboy, he just likes flowers. the gay part comes from his actions and behavior towards sunny.
What are those actions that makes him gay?
usually cited to be him calling sunny perfect like a white tulip, covering up >!manslaughter!<, being unhealthily reliant on him, and sunny using basil as the “damsel in distress” in the dream world. from what i’ve noticed at least.. . he’s def not a femboy tho. he’s just anxious and likes gardening.
Fair enough lel then I guess he really is just feminine
I'm starting to think you guys think I obsess over Sunny.
It's okay Basil, I'm obsessed with Sunny too
But I'm not obsessed with Sunny???

Would
I'm sure >!enduring bullying for 4 years!< and >!committing a horrible crime!< without getting anything positive in return for a person isn't qualified as obsession, uh-huh.
No way my guy. When you're 12, the first thing that kicks in in a situation like this is fear for your own life (even if there's no direct threat), unless something else is in the mix, like a strong feeling of devotion and love for a person you're doing it for.   . Moreover, >!covering the photo album incident!< had nothing to do with the first one, so if by any point he'd feel a need to >!reveal the truth regarding the album !<(and a normal person would feel a need, cuz suffering for 4 years without any payoff is just not okay with any sane person), he could do it at any moment. >!Sunny wasn't even going outside anymore, so it's not like it'd impact him in any way. !<

I can't exactly judge because I have a less intense Sunny obsession, but damn a body pillow and everything.... that's dedication to the craft
: sunny that's not what it looks like (: it's exactly what it looks like)
I wonder how he got those. Did he made them himself or is this an au where snuuy is famous to the point of having bodypillows of him
>  or is this an au where snuuy is famous to the point of having bodypillows of him . . Ah, of course, True Universally Loved, where Sunny just keeps RPG-quest-ing around the city once he moves and becomes world-famous for being that weird-ass kid who just fucking shows up in your house unannounced to like wash your dishes or get your parents back together after a 35 year divorce then comes up to you waiting for a compliment before just wandering off into the city.  . . . He'd be like a reverse Yule Lad, with all the respect for privacy of Link from Zelda. A beautiful new cryptid. He'd have his own merchandise, after signing away his likeness rights for two dollars and some info for whatever random fetch quest he'd gotten himself into.. . &#x200B;. . ...There's still not that much merch though. Basil owns just under half of all Sunny merch ever produced.
Jesus Christ how long did you spend thinking about this
It's been 10 months since I wrote this, but knowing myself it usually just comes naturally. Not very long at all.
lol
Okay, gonna repeat what I said in r/Cursedomori. I want every sunny plush in that room. The little sunny rock to the left at the camera, the teddy sunny to the left, the laying down sunny to the right, the little sunny plush and figure in the back, basically everything sunny except for the photos and the body pillow.
I know you don't want Sunny to leave but this won't help.
Sunny: “WHAT THE ACTUAL F-“
Is that a fucking sunny fumo and body pillow? How the fuck did you get one of those?
"How lucky you are to have a sister like her!". . Indirect personal attack to Sunny
Maybe just personal tbh
>!Now Sunny ain't lucky anymore!<
So... Sunny has a foot fettish to add on to his vore, tentacle, and women who can kill you fettish


And buff planets

Yeah but it still shows a dependency and a huge attachment. . . But im with you i do like both ships and all the evidence you have for Aubrey is very vaild its proven he had a crush on her. Theres also the library where it had a memory of Sunny laying his head on her. Thats a fact i just think over the years i do think Sunny and Basil did grow feelings for each other.. . They hung out the most, i think its clear from Sunnys perspective in Headspace that Basil is easily the most important friend he has there. And if it was just one time they held hands i would agree but they shownit multiple times. The tag, their release energy, and in the sketchbook in blackspace. I think they show it enough to where its intentional. And idk i see it more as a romantic handhold then a friendly handhold idk. Not to mention theyre hugging in the other tag. It feels like a lot. And i still havent mentioned other evidence i have for it
I’ll give you the point about basil only doing that with sunny, however I will counter argue the headspace thing. >!Sunny is trying to make headspace his perfect world where he can be with his friends and it’s like nothing ever went wrong. Therefore everyone roughy acts like we see them act in the flashbacks we see on memory lane. If basil had a habit of holding sunnys hand then it’s likely sunny, is his attempt to make it so everything was like it used to be, would give that feature to basil mint green edition. On the smile thing, that’s nether here nor there, basil is a sad and nervous reck for the entire real world section, sunny thinking back to a time when his best friends was happy and actually smiled as one of the power of friendship motivators makes sense. As for sunny grabbing basils hand, well if someone constantly holds your hand, you’ll likely end up holding theirs back at some point even just as a force of habit thing.!<. >!In short, basil definitely feels **something** for sunny specifically, however whether that is romantic is, in my opinion, far from certain. I think basil has had abandonment issues for a while, your patents up and ditching you will do that, there is an equal chance that he viewed sunny as a family he never got to truly have, a plutonic brother/sibling kinda thing.Obviously this is equally as up for debate as him crushing on sunny, the game doesn’t really confirm anything,!< and like any work of art it’s all up for debate (debating this game is a favourite activity of mine, god I love this game lol)
From a game design perspective making basil stand out by giving him a house and garden makes sense >!it instantly makes the player start to pay attention to him and acts as a way to make the player realise that this character is one that is very important to the story!<. . The thing about the other characters getting nothing is only half true, they individually get nothing, however as a collective three they get the neighbours room. I think it’s interesting that even at this point basil is almost being kept at arms length, he is in his own section which one has to go out through the park and down into its own clearing, away from the neighbours room which is literally the other side of the white space door. >!now whether sunny is intentional doing this after the incident, or it’s more of a subconscious defence mechanism, who can say!< however it is just a detail I find interesting.. Basil is certainly the friend sunny was closest too and was likely the most important of them too him, yes. They were clearly best friends as is clear from the pictures we see. And as I said before basil certainly feels something for sunny, however I would argue that calling it plutonic isn’t really an excuse, it’s just as likely as it being romantic, and the game gives us no evidence otherwise. >!I would say the same for how Aubrey feels for sunny, there is nothing in the game that necessarily confirms that **she** reciprocates sunnys feelings for her, it very well could be a one sided thing.!<
Sure it could be just like gameplay but i think its intentional that Basil is the most standout friend. Its not just a house, he has this huge garden. And yeah its kinda down the way but Headspace, which is canonically Sunnys mind, calls Sunnys house the HEART of the forest.. . And no the others getting nothing isnt really a half truth. Do we see their rooms? No they just kinda mention em, i dont think they exist, Basil seems like the only one who gets that title. . . And i kinda hate these likelys. Its undeniable that Basil is Sunnys #1 person. In the pictures we see that they kinda just started **hanging** cause Sunny lets him talk and vent. But then it just sounds like Sunny and Basil almost just hung out all the time exclusively. And then in the pic in the treehouse Basil gives a little side tangent that "oh sunnysbreading the book i recommended" its sounded like a girl in her diary talking about her crush. . . And to me the. What they just added proves it a little. These rumors and fights about who likes who have been happening far before these console ports, so with this in mind, they decided to not only add basil as a fighter, they: . . 1.Added a tag with them holding hamds and hugging. . . 2. Added a whole new release energy, which we only see one other of, of them looking at each other and then holding hands. . 3. And finally for physical copies they added one photo which is them two hugging in the tag . . I dont think anything was added extra for Aubrey where it shows more of a thing with her. . Maybe im gay and im more used to seeing 2 dudes like how straight people see a guy and a girl but idk i see something there
Sunny dreaming about his crush liking him doesn't mean she likes him back
>omori hates sunny. . Citation needed bruh, I think he still tried to do what he thought was best for sunny in his twisted way
Sunny is that you?. . 
Bro in Sunny’s room
Don't we all already know that he is gay for Sunny?
Ngl I was waiting for something like this as a response.

: that’s kinda gay
Hes not
It's a joke 🙃
Idk what time zone you’re in but happy birthday (I am Sunny and I’m rapidly approaching your location) 
D:
You know if Polly appear pre-suicide sunny would have her in headspace as a member of the mafia
This ending could have gone so hard, but there would have to be a lot of leadup to it. Like sunny finding the gun in a drawer, then quickly shutting it or something.
Yeah! Definitely I think it would make sense if well-done.
: ***\*Gets shot\****
Sunny would lose a hell of a lot more than an eye
I prefer the shears because it's a great parallel to Sunny/Omori stabbing himself
*Shoots sunny in the eye*. . &#x200B;. . *Sunny fucking dies*
Everytime you give alt+tab you get jumpscarred by Sunny.
Literally the wallpaper to Sunnys life
sunny watching as his demon has a seizure (i maxed my mouse sensitivity)
wide sunny
I want one like that of Sunny
Not sunny.
Sunny would just be a bad handwriting
sunny handwriting gang
i disagree, sunny's handwriting would totally be OMORIGAME2.ttf
sunny would write the s in lowercase tbh
Sunny writes like I did in 7th grade, very round and never using lines for u, n, and m for some reason.. . I did that because I read that round handwriting is associated with being kind and artistic, which I wanted to be like.
I still write like that 
Sunny’s handwriting kind of looks like mine
I'm 25 and I'm one cm shorter than Sunny QQ
>!Sunny was forced to leave as he was no longer the youngest sibling!<

I imagine if the incident didn't happen,  Sunny might be super tall, considering Omori's height.
My point is none of the headspace characters can be assumed to be accurate to the real world counterpart, since they're just Sunny's internal impression of them.
I still find it kind of weird that Sunny of all people is taller than 5 and a half feet, especially considering his lifestyle.
alternative interpretation: Sunny could have been even taller
Oh I'm not saying it's short, >!but in Sunny's case he's incredibly small thanks to the malnourishment he unintentionally did to himself, not to mention his mother wasn't there for him.!<. . I'm 18 and 6'0 and yet I feel small at times lol.
Isn't 6 about the average tho, im only 5'8 myself, don't really feel small tho
Yeah it's typically 5'11 to 6'1 for your average height, but you can feel small if you look at it
there is no country in the world with a 6'1 average, and the only places with a 6'0 average are northern european countries. in the vast majority of the world 5' 7 is about average
The average is 5'7 (5'6 in my country, 5'10 in others like nothern countries) for men and 5'3/4 for women
Around there.I’m not 5’6 and while most other guys are taller then me it isn’t like I’m crazy short.
There’s one country on earth where 6ft is average, in the US you are taller than 89% of men in you are 6ft, I think you’re confusing 6ft with “5’10.5 but 6ft in shoes”, also 65% of men exaggerate their height by an inch or more
I’m 18 and 5’5 how do you think I feel?
I agree. sunny was supposedly malnourished yet according to this he's an average height adult male in many parts of the world
thats tough sunny. its extremely hard to be six feet *stretches on tippy toes*
I'm 169 cm too and I barely go outside and have a vitamin D deficiency. . and was malnourished when I was 11,12, and 13 and after that periodically barely eating. . Giving I was also 169cm when I was 14. My growth stopped at 13 or 14, giving my voice didn't changed at all. . Sunny must be in a similar situation I dunno about Basil though. . Probably just naturally short, Sunny short cause of Shut in no grass not eating. . . He would've been 5'11 or 6' if he ate lmao
Sunny seriously gave up that gigantic height advantage.
I can relate 😭
I'm slightly taller than sunny irl with just 1 inch 
Sunny 69 
I hate how this implies Sunny should have been one of the tallest in the group, but his years of malnutrition and laying in bed with depression seriously stunted his growth.
Sunny is an inch shorter than me what the hell. .  . . Edit: I just re-messured my height for this and it turns out i'm shorter than him, Motherfuc- 
16 and the same high as sunny

OMG

y sunn

snuy 
he looks so ominous... perfect to watch you while you sleep... i love himb
Hug the snuuy
I doubt anyone cares but it's important to note that Eyriskylt commissioned an artist on Etsy to make them a plush. Then turned that plush over to a factory in China to mass produce them without the artist's knowledge.. . Charging 75$ a pop for these.. . You might feel that it's fine and purchase but I know that some would not feel right. Since they chose not to disclose any of this information and instead tell people it's *"fan made"* when only the original commission was, I felt I should.   . . . You are free to do what you want of course but there needs to be transparency.
I think it is as well. As only the original commission from the artist was fan made.  . Everything since is for profit and mass produced.
They've been promoting the plush for weeks now and said all of this themselves when asked.. . They said they didn't have to notify the original artist of what they did because they made changes to it.. . *"I got an initial product made off of Etsy, and liked it enough that I wanted to get more, so I gave them a picture, then we went through a few revisions before they got it done."*. . This picture is also an sample picture sent to them from the factory. You can reverse image search it and find it a few places.  . . . Edit  . Added quote

It’s so odd to see people not strangling the fuck out of their plushies
Don't let that thing get too close to a steep edge or a roof with a far drop
PUT HIM IN A BLENDER 😈😈
Sadly I don't have a credit card to buy it 😔
Got mine, my parents love him and so do I. None of them know his dark story though..
literally rei ayanami
Bro the most wholesome thing ever but it gotta test '' stair damage ''
Where can I buy that?
Maybe because of Sunny. When he's afraid, his eyes change colours to a darker red. Maybe her blue eyes are to represent her grief/distress.
i'd guess it's to make her more sharp and energetic. when blue is used for sadness or grief, it's usually a darker blue, but this is a SUPER bright cyan/green. the harsh contrast (and the small pupils) makes her look more fierce, almost electric.
It could be all four, or the three end up telling Sunny what happens in it
Snuy
Snuy
I’d say it’s actually Sunny because of his height.. The picture got cut, but here’s the normal one:. . Also, based on the photo’s description, I’m 99% sure it’s him, but tell me what you think!
I imagine sunny would be a support crowd control for easy swirl damage.... . *Until omori comes in with da dps*
The eyes always bothered me in sunny designs. Aren't those eyes supposed to be from his >!dead sisters hanging corpse?!<
yeah they are, but they've become part of his design
You mean the eyes having irises? I think it's more because >!he finally accepted the truth!<
hot snuuy? hot snuuy pog?
Why sunny's dad left him
What's funny is Sunny is following the tradition of Anemo characters having dead loved ones LOL
if Sunny knew it...
Sunny particle accelerator
It will launch him across the Sunnyverse.
YOU ONLY HAVE ONESHOT SUNNY
That's actually brilliant because it's a visual representation of how this game goes through Something, blackspace and Sunny's guilt, resurfacing after being repressed.. . By starting the game you're beginning the process of confronting the truth.
DONT TAKE MY GAMES SUNNY

Damn, killing her wasn’t enough, apparently Sunny had to scalp her too
Sunny: Goes to sleep after finding out the truth. . OMORI:

“Sunny… why?”
Because first degree murder is fun! 
Yes
: no

&#x200B;. . 

He's 16, so that might explain this
Isn’t this like the closest this game gets to explicit?. . I’m honestly surprised and 16 yo shut in doesn’t have a horny-er mindscape. . . Like you give other people the power to make a liveable world in their mind and I’m pretty sure some of the results would be traumatisingly sus
 .* COUGH * omoriboy...* COUGH, COUGH *
he was seeing r/cursedomori (that's why he never came back)
i mean, the slimegirls exist
And the bodypiilow
Sunny made black space white space 
True tho
I’m sure he has more stuff the game doesn’t show
Black Space 3
he's basically 12 okay?
Slime girls
"Like you give other people the power to make a liveable world in their mind and I’m pretty sure some of the results would be traumatisingly sus" yes. Very sus. Says one of the horny dudes who lost no fap 4 times.
Huh? Who are you talking about?
Abt me. An horny mf
True
He’s 16 and hasn’t really left his house in 4 years. What else do you want to know?
I guarantee you much worse can be found in Omori’s laptop
Fr bro's probably also a 4channer😵
chances are, sunny has fell down the pipeline
It's all fun and games until sunny joins the rising sun.
Hes 16 and has a computer with tissues.
Not from his eyes...
Oh boy maybe he gets bleeding noses then, it must be pretty dry in Whitespace
Not what I was going for but yeah that's an option ig
yeah duh
Yeah... bleeding noses... . . (Deeeefinitley not in the anime sense-)
There's a reason it's called "whitespace"
you just gave me the idea of cumspace

And is isolated from the rest of headspace
This is so fucking  stupid but funny
This is my kingdom cum, this is my kingdom cum
Might as well call it his coom cave
"Omori Boy is my name. . >!My suicide attempts!< are what bought me fame. . But there's much more to know about me mates. . I like to fap and play ol' games"
Lol
>level 3The\Metroid+1 · 17 hr. agoNot from his eyes.... . Ok but fr I never really got the idea of jerking off with tissues. The friction must hurt as all hell
Ask o. The og omori. Omoriboy
lol didnt the omoriboy comics say i fap and play old games
He's just like me fr
*Refuses to elaborate further* *Leaves Headspace* 
these are Sunny's teenage thoughts
It has become clear sunny likes bad bitches
Same reason as Slime Girls
I'm more concerned about the Hole in her Stomach.
She’s a donut that’s why it’s there.
STOP
Well, Sunny saw some crazy things with Kel in Hobbeez.
Seeing that most of Sunny's/Omori's "horrniest" parts are most likely not more than kisses (probably due to censorship) and things a bit further than that, this answer does makes sense 
Same reason the Slime Girls exist 
Whitespace wasn't always white...

go to horny jail bro
Hormones.
this is tame for a 16 year old boy.......as someone who was one.
I remember being in middle school (14-15 yo) and many of my classmates (most girls in a pretty even group) used to read "50 shades of Grey". Crazy phase, kinda funny to watch 'em from the distance tho.
Omoriboy
I think she’s a doughnut
She in canonically a donut

Thats not it, he has the whole Valentine merch of her
After discovering this picture, Basil started asking Sunny for money so he wouldn't show it to Aubrey and Mari
Sunny was based on OmoriBoy, and he says he faps and plays old games. So yeah, add to the fact that he's 16 years old, and it sums it all up.
>!Foreshadowing !<
Where is this in the game
Orange Oasis iirc. I think it’s in all routes.
I WANT TO FIND IT

Every time someone makes a "Sunny horny" joke, I die a little on the inside
He doesn't need to explain his based tastes. I just agree with him.
 : IT'S VITAL TO THE PLOT I SWEAR!
People can exist in swimwear without it being anything weird lol
Horny
Akinu got to her to, but I ain’t complaining
h
ok I haven’t played the game so I don’t know if this is normal but are we gonna talk about her chest?
Man is 16, respect the hustle
I mean, it's a hole in the stomach. My stupid brain comes up with exaggerations like this all the time.
I just realized theres "folds" in the sky, and that is was probably a photoshoot and not a pic from a fun beach day 😔
Probably just a random thing that comes out of nowhere in his dream, like most people dreams don't make sense
He is just a man of culture, that's all
not the hole in the body💀
Man, puberty hit you like truck didn't it Sunny boy?
This actually plays into a headcannon of mine.. . Sunny was twelve when he started isolating himself. The creation of headspace suppressed any other dreams. His lack of eating would have suppressed his puberty. Ages 12-16 is exactly when you would expect a boy experience puberty. So Omori probably had to make choice, either completely suppress Sunny's libido, thus adding it to blackspace wich was already bursting at the seams, or allow Sunny's libido to manifest in the childish world of headspace. Omori chose the latter, resulting in the creation this photo, as well as the slime girls.
He was having omoriboy moment
his inner omori boy is coming out what a king
Doughnut head ahh

I think omoriboy still exists and roams headspace trying to avoid omori and friends, and buy pictures like this
im not sunny but i think the most logical explanation is bisexuality
idc about karma but it's kinda funny that this got 2 (two) downvotes bc i genuinely have no idea why it did lmfao
I still don’t understand why she has a hole in her gut
she has.....a hole on her stomach
Yes
Canonically she's a donut, which is why the hole is there.
If she has a hole in her stomach, then how's she capable of not starving? 🤔
It's a Kanaya maryam reference.
hgngngnhgngngn she is so bad😖😣
"mari omori and stranger wondering why sunny is attracted to an evil donut woman"
He wants to fuck a donut
Yes
WHAT THE-
ask omoriboy
The fuck happened to her stomach


Why does she have a hole in her belly
Wait she is brown?!
Maybe Mari had a body pillow of Sweetheart ?. And then sunny saw it
(there isn't sad sunny)
Yes there is, he's just hiding the sad
Ah yes. Intp.
true
baymax was sunny
I love and hate this at the same time
nah, baymax should be hector
Yes
this strangely fits sunnys character but what the fuck
Baymax should be Something

you should put it behind a giant sunny. . or Leon Kuwata
honestly if sunny got into game development he would probably make something similar to omori
It's always been a post good ending headcanon of mine that Sunny goes into some kind of visually evocative artistic field. Whether painting/drawing of various kinds, writing, or game development, I've always felt Sunny would pursue a field that'd let him keep engaging with his imagination in healthier ways than simply hiding it. Plus I think it'd be a neat tie into >!the Truth insofar as it'd be about him revealing, in at least some part, the parts of himself he stayed hidden in, furthering the demonstration of his growth by having him become more open to the world in his own way.!<
Yeah same, I've thought about that idea a lot, making a game based on my life or smth
He probably wouldn't considering everything he went through
something \*similar\* to Omori.
i mean would you really tell the exact story of your life as a video game. theres no way he could remember all the details anyway
Imagine instead of >!Telling everyone the truth like in the good ending, sunny just pulls out a copy of OMORI for nintendo switch and 30 hours of playtime later, he gets several angry texts and a college student trying to kill him!<
I don't think Sunny would like OMORI as a game, either...
Don't be afraid, Sunny.
OMORI. . *Dunnnnnnn*
. . "Don't be afraid, Sunny"
Snuuy?!
EXCUSE MEH???!!!. . . . I aint snuuy whoever that is... im a train bruh... . (Just joking with you)
please take care of sunny
As someone with autism who's been kicked and beaten in the face with ableism and has been seeing a therapist partly due to the affects of it,  I still say no. . . . Plus it's funny you say he has "limits" when he stabs Sunny. True, it's not directly hate against him, but it's definitely recklessness.
Seriously. If all y'all gonna do is sit here and downvote who I'm arguing with without giving me an alternative argument I will rescind my complaints with Wahloogeh's points. You'll then prove to me you're a reddit mob.
I have basically no experience with anything being talked about here, but I personally didn’t see anything wrong with Basil’s depiction. Its a bit different from the game, sure, but that‘s it. Basically, he had a slightly bigger obsession with Sunny and was more messed up from his parents abandoning him, if I remember correctly (it’s been a while since I read the fic).
Despite everything YOU STILL A HERETIC!!! But now you praised Snuuy with your words!. .  wins!

He won!

!




















 despite everything, it's still you
. . Despite everything Snuuy won!
 calms down
. . He 









what the fuck was this comment thread dude
Pursuit AU doesn’t ship Hero with Sunny, it just makes him an overly obsessive ‘older brother’ figure. Not that the ‘Sunny being used as a teddy bear’ shit wasn’t extremely weird, but then again, what the hell is that entire story haha
Exactly. Oto made it very clear that this wasn’t a Hero/Sunny fanfic, yet people kept spreading that as false information to get people to stop reading the fanfic.
>I will glory to omori. . Worship thy God Snuuy and his envoy Omor!
I will the get om1or the too
When sunny plush i will buy
Nah you’re good lol it’s not a big deal - >!Sunny’s definitely made worse mistakes before!<

!>Yes, killing his onee chan when so many boys have that problem, that problem being not having one. (Don't take this out of context)<!
Wait that logic. . Sunny/Omori is racist for living in a White Space
Omori’s plot: A teenager believes all of his problems would go away if he were white.
Which also implies that Sunny is an accurate representation of a 16 year old, if that's what the body pillow looks like.
Se7en (1995). . >!"What's in the toy box, Sunny!?"!<
Just beat this game for the first time (sunny route) the other day. People watching boutta get exposed to the SADDEST SHIT.
It doesn't hit as hard just watching someone play it with their commentary
>!I headcanon the original as what would probably happen a few years down the line post weird route (can’t for the life of me spell the common name of it) with Sunny overwritten by Omori, the latter now experiencing *hormones.*!<
>! For simplicity its best to call the other route the “Omori” route, the weird route is from DELTARUNE lmao.. Honestly I agree with that headcanon, though it does puzzle me that Sunny is 16 so you’d think he’d have been hit by hormones already?!<
Idk if this requires a spoiler but why nou lol . >!Yeah, but he's also malnourished and traumatized and all that jazz. Plus some teens take longer (or never in some cases) to find certain things as appealing as others their age do, yk?!<
Fair point
>! Well, Sunny is 16 in game. But Omori is 12 (the age Sunny was before SOMETHING happened.) !<
Ok I realize there's a spoiler policy my bad I'll change my comment
No, then that means >!OMORI will be able to see what SUNNY does in the final fight and know exactly how to counter it!!<
omori, with no access to the community or outside world, dubs the good ending “the bad ending” and the bad ending “the good ending”
Wait damn i can absolutely see him doing that
"dang bruh i could've just slashed the violin why didn't i think of that"
No, you see, he already knew, he had the game first, he was prepared
I thought this meant that Sunny was canonically considered pretty by everyone or smth for a second lol
Sunny, why do you need 6 wood planks?
Sunny was hungry 
can't blame him
Whoops 
Sunny out here looking like Freaky Fred.
Sunny:naughtyyyyyyy *freaky fred theme starts*
He is finally happy 
happy snuuy can go to hell 
That sunny smile scare me
He’s becoming that one weird uncle that we all have
He’s becoming that one weird uncle that we all have
He’s becoming that one weird uncle we all have
He’s becoming that one weird uncle we all have
Au where sunny >!sunny gets a piggyback from hero and falls of!< Instead of >! jumping of a building!<
Ok but why is Sunny smiling.
Sunny... lol.
Wait somethings wrong.... SUNNY IS SMILING
cursed sunny 
I WANNA EAT LUNCH WITH THE SCRUNKLIES!! . . Also Omori has drip and all he did was steal Sunny’s shirt and a bowtie
I mean since sunny would be omori irl makes sense. Also I don’t see omoris clothes going too well in a cafe setting
who knew sunny would look so stylish wearing socks (without shoes), shorts (and em bare legs) and a bow tie. and he is the waiter-
ahh i’ll be in tokyo in time for this ! did you have to make reservations ? i see they have a special cake for sunny’s birthday after july 20th i have to gooo
That and >!"I need to tell you something"!<
>!I need to tell you that the Pizza has arrived!<
Ayo the pizza here!
No it isn't im still waiting. . Edit: it arrived like 40 minutes late and was somehow just barely still warm, but now the pizza is, indeed, here.
there were 5 hours between when you commented and edited how tf did it only arrive 40 minutes late
I may have updated a bit late. . Though I did actually order it around noon, for the evening.
Ayo the >!body!< here!
now i am imaging that after sunny said >!i need to tell you something!< he shouted out "PIZZA DELIVERY" then just walks off
Ah, the true true ending.
Well, technically >!He speaks during the narration in his memory lane house, since it's all described in first person!<
I kinda see it as his inner monologue like when >!Omori talks to Sunny that he's unwanted. I don't think that's Omori talking, it's Sunny's inner thought.!<
I mean >!Omori talking and Sunny thinking are the same, right?!<
I think it's more like >!"parts" of the individual. . Sunny and Omori are two parts of the person, separate inner identities,!< like how people act different towards different people, just taken to extremes. . . . To answer your question, maybe.
He was saving his voice for this moment 
🍕
>!"Thanks for the pizza little bro. Let me just come downstairs to get it."!<

>!"The stairs seem pretty slippery..."!<
>!\*insert silly falling sound effects then a silly thud sound effect*!<
: >!fuck, fuck, shit! i'm not ready to hang her AGAIN!<
: "hi omo-... 
I wonder if anyone has made a mod that replaces this text with “ayo the pizza here”
What a game changer.
You forgot about "..."
He says that almost constantly. Not sure how OP missed it.
I just saw this watching a playthrough lol
Well there is the good ending as well 
In text
It is in text what 
Cutscene text ≠ text. (Edit: I don’t have the vocabulary to explain myself properly here but I swear it made sense in my head)
There is no other example of the protagonist of the game speaking, so there is no continuity to break.
yeah I guess you’re right but like come on, who else said it?
I did
Cutscene text is a line of text used in game? It literally is text lmao
it’s different I swear I just don’t have the vocabulary to explain
Maybe it's more of an image (well, more of a gif or something) instead of textbox text? Idk lol
They probably mean different type of text
Text is text, idk what other forms of it he could be talking about 
Like cutscene text is used in cutscene and object text is used for objects therefore different type
Look man, the ending cutscene isnt in a dialogue box. It's not that hard to understand what they mean.
Then he coulda specified that 💀
I was sleepy
I've always interpreted this as the customer shouting this to whoever they live with
Probably not the case for the one guy who says ‘thanks’ all feebly
I don't think it makes much sense, since you can get the line even if you make it to the wrong house.
There is another...
# "PIZZA DELIVERY!!" - Sunny, 2022
 I have to tell you something.  .  ?  .  PIZZA DELIVERY!!  .  Hell yeah Sunny you’re the best
 : Even as a shy and introverted person, you can never miss the opportunity to say "Pizza Delivery!" when the moment arises.
>![insert stairs joke here]!<
>!ayo the pizza here!<
Ayo the pizza here
I DIDNT REALIZE OMG omorin
I know it's not true but I like to think he voice recorded someone saying "Pizza Delivery" and just plays it back each time he's supposed to say it
Tbh I legit thought this was people inside the house shouting in response to seeing sunny, and that he was entirely silent each time.
Ayo the pizza Is here!
Pretty sure that's just the narration.
Been saying this!! Finally someone else noticed
Wait what part of the game is this in?
It’s one of the like five (?) part time jobs in Faraway Town. This one is the one at Gino’s Pizza.
Wait how do you get a job what route is that in??
It’s in all routes but the hikikomori route
Ohhhh ok
there is another
All my dreams finally came true because of this one line.
Sunny: Pizza time!. . Aubrey: I'm not paying for that.
If you push someone down the stairs out of anger you got issues which need resolving. >!I do believe sunny tackles them later or has just grown out of them but there's no indication of it in the story!<
The pizza delievery CAN be canon, so it means whether you like it or not that it's the way Sunny would behave in that situation, so it IS his personality.. . He also goes behind his friends in boss intros.. . And if I had to say, although a knife is a 100% a violent weapon, It does kill quicker and in less pain than the ones his friends have there.. . I'd say a weapon that would require multiple hits, and that would hurt a lot, leve bruises all over your body, break your bones, and leave your organs bleeding internally, like a bat or a cooking pan are way more violent.. . I do agree he is an introvert, but he's not very shy, he can even break into random homes to speak to the people inside, or even take things in there without permission.
Yeah it's up to interpretation, >!but that means we can't really blame people who are not too keen on sunny!<. . Also, use the spoiler tag
yes, I do understand that, but I while no one can just grow up out of the blue like I do think that they can very well take the opportunity of sunny finally being there and use that to change their mindset into one of trying to improve. of course they still have bad habits and are still sour at each other by the end of the game, but the game sets them up for growth, and having the sobering experiences they had is a must for growing in the long run
Ok i can agree on that view heh since you think they dont like get a redemption, rather get set up for one which now that you lay it out i completely agree with!. . ive just heard so many people act like all the characters got a full redemption arc and that all of their past actions and conflicts are resolved which just seems a bit silly in the context of the game, as well as lackin any nuance towards forgiveness in general! so i really appreciate your view, and now i see the game a bit different now!
Sunny's mom
Fr what kind of mom leaves their son on nothing but microwave steak for 3 days
>!pretty sure their parents know what happened. From the dialogue of the tree guy saying “you are not my son” while cutting down the tree I’m pretty sure his parents realised what happened and covered it up themselves, while basically abandoning Sunny!<
>!idk honestly i think sunny’s dad only really like Mari and didn’t care about sunny so when she died he finally could say his true feelings and leave without risking harming Mari’s perception of him. Plus Sunny’s mom had things to do to get the house ready to sell, and from the sticky notes left around the house and the phone messages it seems to me like she wouldn’t have a grudge against Sunny. Then again it is purposefully vague so who knows!<
I honestly dislike how his mother outright neglects Sunny, I mean he stayed in his room most likely but like... she SHOULD'VE got something to him, get a therapist, something, idk.. . She needed to help him, but she doesn't so she has to witness him become less and less like himself... how tragic. And I hate that. It's almost like every mother and father in Omori in some way is flawed... HEAVILY
I thought it was because we were playing as omori at that time, not as Sunny.
She also left him with some money. Why do people always leave that part out?
there are parts of the house that go unexplored by Sunny most of the game, as well as the fact that there are boxes all over the house and  Sunny bothered to look in none.. . no one ever said she was a good mom, but she isn't all that hateable imo
except sunny's dad🫢
My brother in Christ >! Sunny murdered his sister then let his friend desecrate her corpse !<
I love how nobody on this sub knows what the difference between manslaughter and murder is.
What Sunny did aligns more with 3rd degree murder
I'm on this sub too, i don't know the difference, i just know it isn't murder 
Your spoiler tag isn’t working fyi
It works for me tho
Strange, for me it’s not
Why didn't you say so?! Now he's absolved of all guilt
(also joke)
* made massive mistake that he did mean to commit and immediately regretted * lol.
Okay yes by why do you care if I'm being excessive? This doesn't affect you in any way.. . With my example on Sunny it involves him stabbing someone, but there are numerous examples that can be given to basil as well-. . e.g. . >!Tampering with a corpse, fucking up sunny's eye, but in the name of trauma its all okay right????!<. . So yeah, my point still stands.
did you even play the game lol
Yea I did, 100% all achievements in fact
then try to remember it all :)
No Basil tried to kill something not Sunny, not knowing that theyre linked. And him hanging Mari was hm trying to save Sunny. Still bad tho
No? How does Basil removes his guilt in the neutral endings? By killing himself. He tries to remove Sunny's guilt aka kill him, while saying "I'm selfish for doing this." and "Stop struggling Sunny.". . And yes, he had "good intentions" while hanging Mari, saving Sunny. But still super messed up.
No Basils something does not go away in the neutral endings. You see him there dead, eith his something still surrounding him and now Sunny also consumes Basils something. And no he does not try to kill Sunny. You might be the only person who genuinely thinks that. Their somethinga are basically willing thr 2 to fight and the reason Basil goes for Sunnys eye is cause i think hes trying to attack the 1 eye of Sunnys something. . . And i agree its still a bad thing he did with Mari but he only ever did for a good reason and was guilty for it immediately
Basil was just trying to help Sunny >!he just wanted to help Sunny get out of trouble so he hanged her body, the trauma they both got after was Sunny's fault because he was the one that pushed her down the stairs!<
Sunny pushed her because she was purposely forcing him to play for the recital.. . He wanted to spend time with her but he never saw her perfectionism beforehand. Sure he's a murderer but it was unintentional, he loved Mari, and the photos are evidence of that. If you think it's his fault then why the fuck did Basil have to traumatize him by making him go outside and see his sister's corpse?! That's messed up, sure they are all kids but Basil should've called someone, I'm sure he wanted to protect Sunny but it's his fault Sunny locked himself off, he can't even look at him properly pre-truth.. . Hanging someone's body, especially a close friend is messed up, he had a choice and chose the one which ended badly.
Exactly. In life people make mistakes, some own up to it, and some don't. It's all part of life and we gotta move on.. . I can't even imagine people seeing Sunny as a psychopath, every character is different. The game has a clear message people constantly overlook.
I just think Sunny is more likeable, if we got more backstory about what happened after the group got separated that explained why she became so freaking mean i would like her more but we are just expected to like her even tho she did all of those things, i am by no means saying Sunny isn't bad also, he is still a murderer, if Hero was just there when it happened to Sunny nobody would have died and Sunny would still be happy
I don't think so, Mari would likely never look at Sunny the same.. . I mean trying to kill her unintentionally may look fucked up. I don't like this idea that Aubrey is bad, I mean she isn't. She didn't know the photos were ruined by Sunny, she didn't have the right to attack Basil but she used her emotion and anger to retaliate against him, of course, she's gonna resent him. He OWNS the album and Sunny haven't been seen in ages so she assumed Basil of all people.. . If Mari survived and they knew this as the age of 12, the group would probably hate Sunny. There's a really great fic on this too.. . 
It's not aesthetic, I just generally like her :] excluding the bully part. That, and we both have at least one shitty parent (for me it's both parents, coz they enjoy verbally tormenting me, but I've grown numb to their sh!z) . Plus we both have feelings for a certain black haired boy who went through some shit and needs a hug (ye, my irl partner kins sunny and is also here on reddit—)
There's no such thing as "deserved hate" for any of Sunny's friends. these are grieving  and traumatized teenagers we're talking about here.
They are also fictional characters and I am a passionate player with opinions
>!Sunny In blackspace: I need a monstah to clobbah that there bahbil!<

I just got my Sunny and Kel and I have no idea how you even nudged Sunny's vest. That thing will not move a centimeter lol
Slay snuuy  you're a baddie  you're rocking that intense expression face 
…why Sunny wearing a dress😭😭
why not? 
Why did you got downvoted lol, like your comment isn't funny, but it isn't horrible either, it should be at neutral.
That’s rude, Sunny would never say that. I don’t know what he would say but it wouldn’t be that.
He just wouldnt respond
I like to think that Sunny would hug Basil.
I'd like to think that as well but he probably wouldn't thinking about the bathroom scene where basil was having a breakdown and sunny left him in there
Oh, It fits in that context. (Why do I get the feeling basil would actually do it if sunny asked though?) speaking of context though, did you notice how basil only ever smiled in the presence of of directly while interacting with sunny, and not with any other characters, almost as if he’s looking to sunny to try and get some reassurance, which sunny isn’t able to give him until the end of the game, where sunny finally smiles and confirms to basil that everything will be okay.
You should have gone around saying >!"sunny, I love you"!<

shit ur right!
what no he's a prince of light. like the entire point of his character is to hide, destroy information and deliberately forget it so sunny can live in bliss. . also could be a knight of void (literally protects an absence of knowledge), idk where you got prince of mind from

Omori's sprite of him looking left and right are used when you play as Sunny in white space for the first time on one day left. If you walk around you he will watch you, ominously. . . Also, amazing work dude! Your sprite edits look fantastic!
I'm surprised someone just knows that off the top of their head. Thanks for the info!. . Also, thank you for the compliment. I'll hopefully slowly get better over time. It helps that most of the work is already done by other people in this case, as they're obviously existing sprites.
You're welcome. Keep making those amazing sprite animations!
That one's literally a color-swap of Sunny's existing crying sprite, so I can't really take credit for that, haha.
Sunny daydreaming about headspace: **plays when sitting on a bench and then this plays also then stops with the screen going black then sunny is out of the bench**. . Omori doing knife tricks: **plays in the final battle with omori, he will play his knife tricks then a few seconds, the battle will begin**
Sunny mom
Can you please go hug that scrawny kid called Sunny.
I will do it with ma by 💕
>!I like how one of Sunny's eyes are covered :)!<. . and he is blushing, so cute
yeah but sunny's only wearing the shirt for the advertisememt of the shirt, I think.
No one gonna talk about the shirts? Sunny if you're going to get a personalized t-shirt why on EARTH would you get THAT printed on it?!
he's embracing his demons, by like, wearing them on himself or something. i dunno. good looking t-shirt with interesting symbolism.
You're missing several other beds in your survey. Sunny has an interaction for every single bed.
If only there was a bed page in the wiki
Ok. Give me some time, I had to factory reset my Switch and am waiting for downloads to finish.
Oh god
Ready yet
Getting there. I had a LOT of games... 
:0 give us the link if you decide to follow through with updating the wiki
While yes, but actually maybe? Headspace is weird, almost like it's a dream or smth, as the logic doesn't really make sense??? . . >! Technically headspace, from what I know, I made purely from Sunny, as he's the "dreamer" who created this world, he then turned into omori, who is the dreamer's (hypothetical, no evidence for) protector, omori, then made the world ignore the bad stuff, so stuff like Aubrey loving omori is the same as Aubrey loving sunny, as that's how sunny sees it (or wants to see it), in that same regard you could argue the same with basil, but that also could be considered a special instance, we also know that sunny doesn't like (example) certain sodas from headspace item flavor text, which could also be argued that sunny is in control with what gets punished and what doesn't !<
ahhh the brain does a lot of silly stuff without our active input though  trauma response is some crazy shit
She's not bi, Sunny is. . She just saw the flag on his pfp and liked the colors, so she used them as well lol
No, I’m referring to this. . 
actually, thats fem sunny! you can see sunny on the other side, not omori!
Here's an interesting note: . . I've noticed that this is the second piece of the earlier artwork for the game  that has Sunny with an IV connected to him, [this being the other](). So I wonder if there were plans to have him go to the hospital earlier in the game? Maybe being a bit more...explicit showing how messed up he is mentally? Or maybe the crew already had what happens in-game in mind, but it seems a bit...spoilery to have that in early promotion like they did.
You mean have them figure out >!what Sunny did and after seeing how depressed he and Basil were, decided to try and send them to the hospital to help them with their problems?!<
Honestly, I was thinking that Sunny might self-harm in-game at some point maybe early on. The game kinda implies he does, but maybe they were gonna have it be a bit more explicit in saying so.
I must have missed that, how do they imply Sunny self harms? Closest I can think of is the stab command, but being that was always in headspace I just interpreted that as self loathing rather than self harm.
Sunny definitely has, at the very least, an interest in knifes. Omori can only equip knifes as weapons in Headspace, he carries one around with him for a chunk of the first day he's out of the house instead of putting it away the previous night, any time he fights Something he picks one up. And the stab command shows he at least subconsciously thinks of hurting himself. Not to mention the art shown here has Sunny holding his knife, which looks like it has blood on it.
I would've guessed it'd be some twist ending like he was in a hospital the whole time
fem sunny with a cleaver let's gooooo
pigtail sunny has a fucking cleaver O\O
Female Sunny with cleaver…oh god. . I guess it was a blessing that never made it to the game…because the cleaver would probably make it PG

where’d it go
There's no cool backstory, just a strabismus
>!It was our favorite soft boy wasn't it?!<
Spoiler please
Nice try Sunny, I know that isn't a cosplay,you can't deceive me Sunny I know it's you in that image,you just don't want people here saying "omg that's Sunny from OMOR" so you try to disguise yourself but I can see the truth!. . >!^(/s,but you really do look like what Sunny would probably look in real life tho.)!<
Well I wasn't expecting you to discover my identity so fast
Wait...he's real? Wow.... . ^(thesnuuyisherethesnuuyisherethesnuuyishere)
Stop ! I'm not here !
ok 
I think I remember seeing your art account from a while ago, and now you're also an excellent Sunny cosplayer?! The talent! 
Oooh thank you !!!
“Irl Sunny isn’t real”. Irl Sunny:
The most accurate Sunny cosplay so far
sunny wgen the 
Omg Sunny omor irl. . (You look just like him fr it’s awesome)
There he is, Sunny Omori
AWWWWWW SNUUY
Oh my god Sunny irl. . The cosplay looks amazing
Thank you :D
"hey sunny is that a crush?"
>!I thought that was called sunny side up or smth!<
>!That's the same thing!<
>!why do omori fans name ships. some of them are really weird. they range from sunburn which yeah, I get that, it refers to that one underground library book but sunny side up? not only does the name not make any sense, the ship its self is really fucking weird.!<
>!If you think omori ship names are weird, you really have to see how Pokemon fans name those ships!<. . >!Trust me, Omori ship names are nothing compared with those Pokemon ships. They already named more than 20 thousands ships, everything they can pair with.!<
Wait. Pokemon ships are a thing? I just learned something new
[See here]()
>!yh agreed, but the reasoning for the name is that Hero likes cooking, yh? and im guessing you prolly know that sunny side-up is a way of saying fried eggs in North America. so SUNNY side-up!<
>!ohhhh ok that makes some sense. still a really strange ship. i mean, that's like going out with someone who then dies, so you go out with there younger sibling. that's both messed up AND breaking the bro code at the same time!<
>!yh its weird af imo!<
>!not as bad as Mari x Sunny!<
>!this is true omori plush!<
Meanwhile, me reading this comment thread: 
same 
ship names for sunny x aubrey (sunburn), sunny x basil (sunflower), and sunny x kel (suntan)
Damn sunny has big ass ears
Thanks, i didn't wanna realize it
Aubrey is actually just asserting her dominance by using Sunny as an armrest.. . >!Her revenge after the true ending is to bully Basil and Sunny for the rest of high school.!<
What kind of bully is that?
The kind that makes the less popular kids do her bidding.
for a second i thought a hand was reaching out of sunny’s neck
I know, but it's still so funny to me that >!Sunny thinks he's so desperate to get higher, he'd wear heels for this !<

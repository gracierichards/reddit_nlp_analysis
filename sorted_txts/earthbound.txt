found out because people were comparing it to earthbound, and as a diehard earthbound fan i had to check that out.
Which is the better game?
Hard to say, you can't compare two masterpieces, just experience them. However I will try to judge them by their content.. . Let's start with the good points about OMORI. The story is much more developed, the character progression is very good, both of which are rivalled only by Mother 3 in the Earthbound trilogy. The RPS battle system is good AND unique, however OMORI's difficulty curve resembles a logarithm than a line. (Aside from Sweetheart, you shouldn't have any trouble fighting bosses. Humphrey doesn't count; he's just an endurance test.) Both soundtracks are fine, though aiming at different goals (OMORI's aims for a bittersweet theme, while Earthbound aims for the comforting nature similar to one's mother. Mostly.). . Concerning the pacing of the game, OMORI starts off strong, only to falter in the Headspace sections (some parts definitely overstay their welcome, though this is probably intended due to Omori's nature to >!protect Sunny from the Truth at all costs!<). and comes back stronger in Black Space, the real world and the ending sequence. Earthbound starts off very weak (The Sharks gang in Onett is not newbie friendly and you may die multiple times trying to get past them, and Twoson features some of the worst effects in the game, Mushroomized and Cold), but stays strong for the rest of the game. (Except the monkey hole section in Dusty Dunes Desert.). . The theme of both games is polar opposite (and this is also felt in the soundtracks of both games). OMORI's is a lot more sad and bittersweet than Earthbound, focusing on remembering old memories lost in time, while the latter is more cheerful and adventurous, focusing on creating childhood memories. The jokes of both games, though, are very much in the same style, which shows that OMORI's main inspiration is Earthbound.. . I would consider OMORI to be the most polished product, however Earthbound, in my opinion, has this incredible charm that will keep it close to my heart. And perhaps, if Earthbound never existed, then OMORI may have turned out very differently...
I’m playing Earthbound right now for the first time and I’m going through Twoson / Paradise, and I’m already loving it. You’re telling me this is the **worst** part of the game? Wow I’m excited
Actually, I'd say that the only reason why Twoson is bad, alongside Onett, is that you are alone when fighting enemies, and the effects they inflict can be pretty bad. (Some later effects can also be pretty devastating, but you should be able to learn some powerful PSI that will be able to cure them easily, as well as having more PP to do this.) Peaceful Rest can be very annoying because of the Cold effect and extremely fast UFOs, but the payoff is among the best parts of the game. And even then, Twoson is still a nice place to progress in Earthbound.. . But yes, the game only gets better the more you progress, in my opinion. (with a few exceptions here and there, though)
Nice critic. Agree that some parts overstayed their welcome, but kinda wish the game was either trimmed down a bit, or give us a stronger reason to push through the content overload.
Both, both is good.
Both
Omori tbh. Take it from an Earthbound fan, a lot of parts of it don't really hold up today and the plot and characters are far less developed. It is a lot of fun though still and a great game. I'd say Mother 3 is a more fair comparison
oh aight, coincidence? i think not! but anyway omori was recommended on steam to me recently, and i was considering buying it, it gave me earthbound combat vibes, with more serious undertones, so, without spoilers, like, beyond 1h of play, what's the game about?
You go on adventures with your friends in a dream like world, searching for something. Along the way, you find a mysterious darkness that is slowly making itself more apparent. . . Heed the game’s content warnings for anxiety, depression, and suicide.
i said i was going to see you lot once i plat it but i've got a quick question before i get any further (spoilers ahead) . . . . in which order should i do the routes? google says there's normal and h-something route, is which route you play first up to preference, or should i do one or the other first to better understand what's going on?
I went with the normal route when I first played but you can do either honestly! They’re both really good
There are baseball bats in *EarthBound* too. I think that's kind of a surface-level similarity, honestly.
I love this! I constantly wanna see more art with these protags together- it's cool tracking earthbound's influence across all of them and seeing how each one plays off the themes 😭💖 the art is super cute, too, your style is so crisp and clean!
Oh no! It's the Omori version of Ness from Earthbound-
not earthbound inspired (probably)
EarthBound isn’t an indie though.
“Honoured Guest: Earthbound”
I’m blind okay.
Don’t worry, I didn’t see it either at first
It had support from Nintendo, but the primary writer /director was just a Japanese writer who happened to be friends with Iwata and wanted to try making a video game
Every character from Left to right. . Madotsuki from Yume Nikki. . Omori from Omori: Thinking of renovating to replace the stairs with *something* else. . Brad >!No!<Armstrong from LISA the painful RPG. . Mae from Night in the woods. . Niko oneshot from Oneshot, trying not to look up. . Wayne "The Plane" from Hylics and Hylics 2. . **Amogus** . . Alex from YIIK moments before Yiiking out. . The Batter from OFF, Telling Kris how to abuse the player. . Kris from Deltarune, Telling the Batter that they wish he was their dad. . Ninten from Earthbound Beginnings. . Ness from earthbound, Explaining how to kill religion. . Frisk from Undertale, who already fought god and won. . Lucas from Mother 3, え？　何お言いますか　それは英語か？　分かりません...
I think it's Madotsuki
All of this just to make a typo....
Happens to the best of us lmao.
I think when people describe "quirky" indies, they refer to story-driven RPGmaker-esque games inspired by Earthbound. So Hollow Knight isn't one of those kinds of games.
Not an RPG Maker game or even an Earthbound-inspired RPG.
understandable, didn't realize that the art was for rpg maker games.. . the white board said Quirky Indie games.. . so I thought that it was talking about Indie games, not rpg maker games
Earthbound is an indie?
No it ain't. Try reading the chalk board.
Oh right 😂
How is Earthbound an indie game
It's not, it's an honored guest if you'll check the chalkboard.
wait.. earthbound isnt indie lol
Yeah but the chalk board says they're guests.
Why earthbound characters are here?,earthbound isn't indie
If you read the chalkboard you'll see.
earthbound... Indie...
Read the chalkboard.
Most of those games (not cuphead tho) are awful, and not in a fun way like Yiik.. . But yes, this is quirky earthbound inspired rpgs only.
Idk man fnaf and bendy were cool at first but now they are sort of bad so I see why you say that. Fnaf will always be nostalgic to me tho.
This subreddit makes me feel like an old person sometimes lol
Yea and I'm only 15.
Yeahhhhh I'm 24 lol
Nice
Are Earthbound and Mother 3 really "quirky indies" though? Nevertheless I still really like the art
Read the board
Yume Nikki (girl in the top left) . . one shot(cat character drawing on the board) . . YIIK (guy next to the on shot character) . . earthbound speaks for itself same with our monochrome fellow on the bottom left. . LISA: The painful (beard guy sitting in front of the tv). . Night in the woods (Cat character sitting in front of the tv). . Hylics (yellow crescent character sitting in-well you get the idea). . OFF (monochrome guy sitting next to the green and yellow character). . Deltarune (yellow and green human with the cap). . And then, out of sight, there’s frisk (undertale) sitting with the earthbound gang in the middle seat out of sight. . Favorites are omori (duh), deltarune and earthbound
Appreciate the response! Thank you.
Nooooo problem :)
Yo, who’s with the earthbound/mother bois?
I like how Earthbound is just allowed to chill here
I saw the Earthbound gang and said "Those aren't indies" then I looked at the blackboard and felt outplayed 
isn't earthbound/mother triple A? it was made by nintendo   (btw cool art)
Earthbound fans survive without any type of news for 30 years, Omori fans can survive some decade without content...
That’s okay, it’s not supposed to be a mainstream game and also people will always look back thinking fondly of Omori. I mean, Earthbound fandom for example don’t really get anything new in decades but is still well regarded by many.
"Earthbound-based RPG about depression". . and this happens to be the only game that fits this affirmation
I haven't played Lisa: The Painful yet, but does that also fit?
Lisa the Painful is about *a lot* more than just depression, but it *will* fuck you up mentally.
There's a lot more than just depression as well around it, addiction is another big thing as well as trauma from both past and present sources. It's a game where you do need to take the content warning seriously if you're sensitive to any topics at all.
I haven't played it either, but I think yes
I haven't finished it, but it doesn't seem to be about depression whatsoever, just extremely dark and depressing.
omori is about more then just depression
omori isnt about depression
Um... It's literally about a depressed kid that has a dream world
 i guess depression could be counted as a theme but it isnt a main theme
What is it mainly about then?
The main theme is definitely trauma and coming to terms with yourself.. . Depression is a theme but not the main one.
I guess trauma?
did lil bro play the game
its about grief trauma guilt and forgivenesss coming terms with yourself and your past
Hear me out. . It's all three and more?
yes
i guess depression could be counted as a theme but it isnt the main theme
it isnt about depression its a theme but it isn't about it if that makes sense
Earthbound-inspired RPGs about depression list:. 1. Omori. 2. Heartbound. 3. Lisa(?). 4. ???. 5. Index out of Bounds. . . So many huh
That’s my thoughts every time Mother 3 is mentioned or anything Earthbound/Mother in general.
C'mon Reggie, give us Mother 3
How about this instead?
Should have expected this from EarthBoundFan3
Classic EarthBoundFan3
There's soooo many games that can be added here, and to think that all of these games were inspired by Earthbound...
Actually contrary to popular belief, some of these games are not inspired by Earthbound. The best example being OFF, as Mortis Ghost, the creator of the game, had not yet played the mother series until after the release of OFF (Fun fact, Mortis has said that if he did play the Mother games before making OFF, the ending to OFF would have definitely have been different). . But what we can say is that Earthbound did affect the RPG landscape, allowing creators to make things that are not part of the norm
Did Mortis say how the ending would have been different? I really needed to watch those streams they spoke in.
I think he said something along the lines of the game not having such a depressing ending, but something more akin to Mother 3's ending
that would've been interesting, but personally I do like Off's ending. >!I think a redemption arc for The Batter would've been a little too goofy. There's something satisfying and very in character for The Batter never changing his ideals throughout the game.!<
The quirky earthbound inspired RPG/RPGMaker game people
all earthbound drawings should look like the graphics. . cute
Finally getting it's own physical copy. Neat.. . I notice that it has a higher rating than Earthbound on the E-shop, from the one game it takes inspiration. I wonder if there's newer darker stuff added to these editions...
>Neither are ness from earthbound, Link from Zelda, or cloud from final fantasy. Yet you can rename them and literally nobody thinks they’re blank slate characters.. . I haven't played those games, so I won't really say anything about that lmao  . . . >  . I’ve seen people name him “covid” and still take the game completely seriously. This is really not an issue at all. . That's true, but not everyone takes it as seriously. I remember someone saying they restarted the game because they realized their name was really weird, and didn't fit their route.  . . . I personally don't really mind that much, just pointing out why most people dislike it.
Man some of y'all really are actually children in here. Merch is expensive, this is pretty much gonna be a "collectors" item, those are typically pretty expensive. $70 for 350+ pages of original art, interviews, insights, and dev journals is extremely, EXTREMELY reasonable for what this is. It took time and effort and this is in no way, shape, or form required to purchase to enjoy Omori or be a fan of the game.. . I bought a replica portal gun years ago. That's basically a bunch of plastic and some LED lights and it ended up being over $100! It's mass produced, while every bit of content in this is hand crafted. While the pages are mass produced, what's on them took hours upon hours of effort. This is a very reasonable price. (See - anything earthbound related, at all.). . If it's that important to you, someone will probably scan the whole thing online and you'll all be gushing about the little jokes and memes in it for months to come.. . edit: that shipping do be ridiculous tho. that has to be some sort of issue or really bad oversight.
Exactly. This isn’t just an art book, it’s an insight into the developers thought processes and design. And Omori is an artistic game. There’s going to be a lot in there.
Glad there’s someone normal here. This is such a weird post complaining about a fairly reasonable price. The shipping for some people is worth being miffed about, or asking what’s going on. But the price for everything in the books is pretty reasonable imo too.
completely agree! Most art books I have seen usually cost $40-$96
Reading the comments here make it sound like some 20 page artbook. No, of course its 350 pages. That makes the price 100% fair and anyone who doesn't think so is completely ignorant of the actual COST of books like this. Look at any full color Tabletop book. Full color with artwork is expensive and 350 pages of it is insane value for 70 dollars.
Issue, most of the fanbase IS children
Absolutely agree. Also it’s sad to see how entitled some people are over this stuff
Exactly!! Reading the title of this post, I actually was expecting the price to be way higher. I mean the listing doesn't show the dimensions but I'm assuming the book is quite large. I really believe the issue here is maybe the subreddit population is pretty young - I think you've hit the nail on the head, it's mostly children here. . . If I had extra spending money I would love to buy this. Honestly it's a great deal for the price in my opinion. I think the concerns about the international shipping costs, and that you can't buy the books individually are valid, but the $70 price itself is incredibly reasonable.
I completely agree with you, the entitlement in this thread really is something else. The $55 shipping is a bit of a bummer, but the price for the books itself is very reasonable.
The portal gun ended up being $9.3326215443944152681699238856266700490 x 10^157 ??? . . Damn I don't know how much money you have but if it cost you over ten times the current amount of money in circulation I think you might have gotten scammed.
Omori is actually ness from earthbound.
an earthbound playthrough

> Earthbound-inspired RPG about depression. . > Mother 3
> (Also, I really can only think of a few examples where you get to name the protagonist where they aren't a blank-slate, and a lot more examples where they are a blank-slate, but that's just my experience so IDK). . You've never played Earthbound?
That's one of the "few examples"
Earthbound was following in the steps of a great many JRPGs where you name all your party members.
Eh, well, they're both also openly inspired by Earthbound, but that's still pretty broad.
They have the same root (earthbound) so it's logical to compare them. Like I compare Hearthstone and MTG, Doom and Ultrakill, Crash bandicoot and Dark souls ect.... Yes everything about the story is different but like both games are good, let's see which game did better in their own right and imagine a perfect game that could have combined both. Idk maybe i'm stupid to try to make communities THAT different to come together.
omori is an earthbound clone
earthbound is actually an omori clone.
No,  Earthbound was a Mother clone. . \*This is obviously a joke im not that dumb\*
That it not just another earthbound knockoff made for Tumblr who ship underage males while acting like said males with underage females is wrong and bad
Oh... EarthBound.... . .... .... .... . Well in that case i guess your correct?
Yeah, he just gave me daddy long legs vibes idk
I like this being the explanation for OMORI being an EarthBound-inspired indie RPG about depression
Saw it while browsing through game pass. I thought, wow this is a cute looking rpg inspired by earthbound, I’ll check it out. I went in completely blind and was BLINDSIDED by this game. Wasn’t expecting the horror elements at all. Don’t regret it for a second though, games a masterpiece
a youtuber called YuB in the video called something like “earthbound but emo”
Earthbound, I first heard it was like a type of earthbound inspired game and had to try it. Didn't disappoint and cried.
I heard the “ Quirky earthbound rpg about depression” jokes for a while but never really interacted with it until it released on consoles. I thought the the game had a unique art style and found out last minute that it was a horror game ( I got really excited then and decided to play the game only at night ). Omori is my favorite game now 😭
Due to a mention in multiple best/great rpg lists, as well as through memes in the celeste and earthbound communities. I did go into the game blind for the rest though.
I think what makes us stand out is just how different OMORI is, sure it's horror and has a fun chill vibe for the RPG genre but it stands out as something unique (compared to UT which was basically Earthbound).. . Eventually this sub will be infected with children, which isn't bad but we should teach them that this fandom can and COULD be better. It's why I never downvote, harass, insult, poor shitty words on other people. I'm all in for healthy discussions as a gamer it's kinda my job to analyse and discuss all sorts of topics in a neutral state.
Very mature view! 👍
This is the way
I find the meme above funny cause it points out the sudden increase in earthbound inspired rpg games with themes of depression, while also praising  five nights at freddies. It's a wacky meme.
i thought the same until o saw the whole “creator sexualised young boys”. reads like a genuine omori hater rather than like a fun meme to me idk
Earthbound
This is the correct answer

Earthbound, considering headspace
Definitely Earthbound.
Maybe Earthbound!

earthbound and omori fan spotted

Considering Matpat is a Earthbound fan I'm not surprised.
I really should play Earthbound but I don't know how to use an emulator.
Really easy if you watch a YouTube video of how to do so for both PC and mobile, or you could play it on Switch if you have Switch Online. I first discovered the game back in 2012 and it's become one of my favorite games of all time. I usually try to play games that fall under the "quirky earthbound inspired rpg" title to recapture that spirit it left behind, and it definitely has(that's how I originally discovered Omori when it was first announced)
The only bad things here imo are the autism hate thing which I had no idea about and the hearthbound situation.. And even though it's pretty sickening to hear Matpat draw similarities with Undertale and Earthbound on every RPG he plays it's not really that big of a deal, only exception is the Hearthbound sitution which he escalated.. . Also he only made two Omori streams and one of Lisa, so I think he realized they weren't fit for his audience.
Scientific analysis!? In my silly Earthbound inspired RPG game about depression!?????. . 
Holy shit why. The fuck is Emo earthbound scawy
I feel like bringing up that this was one of the details inspired by Earthbound. In Earthbound, you can choose which food is your favorite (and that will be the food your mom feeds you whenever you visit home again). The default option for that prompt is STEAK. . . :)
Earthbound new game
In case you still haven't played it: you play as a kid who experienced a traumatic event four years ago, and now visits a magical dream world each night, where he takes on an alter ego (the titular "Omori") in an attempt to suppress the memories of said event.. . When the game starts, he's moving away from his hometown in three days, and one of his old friends comes to see him. He goes outside for the first time in years, and begins to confront his trauma.. . These obviously aren't exact numbers, but the game is essentially 50% Dream World content (a quirky Earthbound-inspired RPG), 30% Real World content (practically a Visual Novel without much gameplay, sort of comparable to the "To The Moon" games in a way) and 20% nightmare scenes (the horror content, which ... honestly isn't particularly great in my opinion). . Also, do keep in mind that the game was mostly made by people who had no experience with making video games, so the gameplay isn't exactly the most groundbreaking, and there may be a few cases of "detail that was once meant to be more important, and now feels slightly out of place", because the game took 7 years to make.
that moment when the quirky earthbound inspired rpg about depression gets sex toys:
I wouldn't call dakimakuras "sex toys" just because some neckbeards are humping the shit out of them tbh. They're mainly for hugging purposes.
She's literally in lingerie and drawn with big boobs I'm pretty sure it's got a sexual element
doesnt make it a sex toy tho
Ok, not a sex *toy*, but it's definitely not purely for totally innocent hugging
Really you could say that about a lot of things
Just because a cucumber’s shaped like a dick doesn’t make it a sex toy.
I’m glad the 3DS port came out!!^.^ seeing Otherworld in 3D is soooooo pretty:3. . If only Earthbound was on the 3DS, too… we’d have two amazing RPGs!!
i hope more games use this sort of game vibe. . obviously not "horror game rpg about trauma" but like, indie rpg's kinda that are sorta like earthbound with a fun vibe but with a darker tone to it all
Would also recommend Earthbound! Omori was obviously inspired by it in a great way :)

yea I thought it might be overkill to add the sunflowers (I only had the orchids at first) but it fills up the space nicely ^^
Sunflowers are incredible sources of folic acid. 100 g of kernels contains 227 µg of folic acid, which is about 37% of recommended daily intake. Folic acid is essential for DNA synthesis. When given in anticipant mothers during the peri-conceptional period, it may prevent neural tube defects in the baby.
Thanks Sunflower Seeds
Don’t do that, I already have ptsd from sunflower fields
I also found out about Omori in a weird way.. . The first video I saw of it was called "Naming yourself Omori" but didn't really care. . The second one was about sunflowers with Sunny and Basil there on the screen, I liked the characters and I also liked sunflowers, so I searched "Omori" on youtube and found some more videos. . (Since I didn't think I'd buy it I just watched a playthrough of it, but after watching it I bought it anyways. It was just too good not to buy, even if I did know the plot already)
owo. best ship, sorry sunflower(or what it was)
Same here, I actually kinda dislike Sunflower, but that's just it isn't heavily implied canonically, unlike Sunburn. Nevertheless, I still respect Sunflowers.
I personally just like sunburn more than sunflower so😹😹
sunflower is probably one of the most problematic legal ships
Upvote, saved, shared, and followed you. I need an award to give to this incredible art (✿ ♡‿♡). . Edit: Oh yeah I ship sunflower hehe ¯\(ツ)/¯
Oh my !! You're so sweet thank you !!
Lmao
Aren't all of us. Probably not but hi, i'm too
I'm not really a sunflower shipper, but damn that art is gold
wheres the sunflower one
I've seen it on Pinterest Here it is. . 
ty :3
Sunflower supremacy
~~Burnt Sunflower amirite~~
🗿
Roasted sunflower seeds, yum!
Yeah I guess, but sunflower… can’t be beat
true!!!!
I've barely seen any Sunflower lately tbh. Maybe 1-2 fanarts.
You should hop on Twitter (only for the fanarts, ignore everything else). You'd have to scroll through at least seven different Sunflower artworks before finding a glimpse of Sunburn.
Petition for more Sunflower posts/art, raise your hands 
Yeah especially on reddit. Like i know with Helluva Boss. The main ship and relationship is gay yet the straight character and relationship is almost more loved on the reddit.. Whereas id guess that Sunflower is more popular on twitter (as it should be 😤)
Yeah I do prefer the Omori shipping scene on Twitter
Yeah ro me Sunflowe is the cuter ship and to me the one that works rhe best and has the most evidence for. But im fine with most ships
I think it's healthier than Sunflower
Sunbrey would have more to work out than Sunflower?
I dont like it together but i love the characters separate.. . . . . . I ship Sunflower so...
Dislike: its not sunflower
Sunflower 
it's not sunflower
Fuckin W, > sunflower
Burnt Sunflower 
Woohoo Sunflower!
ayo fellow sunflower shipper
Ayo 
. . Its so cute and just fuels my sunflower love
That's my favourite too . It's even my wallpaper XD
Plus sunflower looking at each other :]
Sunflower
The calendar prints have a shit ton of Sunflower in them too
It’s almost like they’re friends
That is true
\#Sunflowermoment
Same along with Sunflower 
i like this if it's in the same universe as sunflower
I won't fight you, so that way I can have my sunflower
Basically all us sunflower shippers ship this
“Sunflower is canon” or something dumb like that
I can't get over them, man, where's that one sunflower compilation post of everything about them that's like ten pages. . Edit: [there it is]()
Good question, if you’d like I can send my own rant, but I lack the source of the original
I will happily accept any and all happy sunflower rants
(I made this rant like 6 months ago so sorry if it lacks some up-to-date sunflower lore)
Mods seem to have instantly sniped this, can you DM me?
There
Me too
Oh you have a rant?
I was asking for you to send it to me
Oh sure
Could you send me the rant as well?
I thought you’d never ask
can i also have the rant 
… do you also want to see my rant?
yes
Go ahead and PM me; I may have responded to it before though.
May I also ask for the Sunflower rant 🙏
I NEED TO KNOW THE SUNFLOWER LORE PLEASE 🙏
Wanna see my rant?
Can you please send me your rant too? Need higher Sunflower rant content in my life.
hell yeah 🙏🙏
Danke, adding this to the collage.
Sunflower has that effect on people
Sunflower is so peak. Favorite Omori ship, no competition.
OH MY GOD SUNFLOWER PROPAGANDA HELL YEAH THIS MAKES ME HAPPY
You Know what. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   . Hell Yeah,  . Sunflower
WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY DOWNVOTES IM SCREAMING 😭 🙏 (he’s not over exaggerating…. SunFlower for life 🙏)
YEAH BUT THIS IS NOT INTENTIONAL AS LOVE ROMANTICALLY CANON GROW UP FANDOM
I still ship it.
Real (watch sunflower fans jump the entire reply section 💀)
Sunflower fan here, I’m actually fine with this.
My judgement was wrong
Me, a southern Sunflower shipper: 
Sweet home Alabama
Wot in da cousin lovin southern fuk
I’d actually be very scared to say that, I’m scared the sunflower shippers will attack me
I don’t fear them 
the balls of steel
+2 soul hearts
Based
We don’t do that, everyone else just attacks us lol. . . Unless maybe you comment it on a sunflower post which, why would you even do that?
as one of them myself (i won't speak for everyone else because they aren't me) i don't mind if you think that, after all, shipping for me should all be in good fun, right? as long as it isn't illegal or anything
*inhales* Sunflower wouldn’t be a healthy ship
they said unpopular
I like sunflower.. . (Or is this subreddit not in the weekly sunflower hater phase yet?)
most sane sunflower shipper
Mods had fun with this.
Sunflower will be confirmed canon mark my words 
I will, so when you are proven wrong I'll come back!1!1!  (There probably won't be any ships at all)
I love sunflower! . .

Happy ending!

I love Sunflower but it's not my favorite ship. But I do think it has a good amount of canon backing it compared to some of my favorites.
What is your fav ship? And tbf its hard to like all of em
If your a field of sunflowers, technically this would be your toe
None of the new content has sunflower either though ?
No id say there is. At the very least theyve added a ton for people who ship it to further ship it. The calendar theyrebasically inseperable in every pic. In the new boss rush mode added recently they added the two tags that are pretty shipable moments and the release energy which shows them holding hands which is heccking cute
Omori fans when they see two little boys being close together because they are best friends (there are clearly romantic implications). Have you never had friends or something?
As a sunflower shipper this makes me very happy
Hecc yeah.
i love sunflower
The greatest
i agree
common sunflower W 
Very common sunflower W
Sunflower if you know what I mean
sunflower ship

Friend downloaded it and needed someone to vent about what was happening in there, so I watched it since I have no way of downloading it myself (for now). . I do plan on actually playing it once I buy myself a Switch, therefore I'm trying not to spoiler myself the new "Sunflower content" (- my friend).
Then there are ones at twitter and tik tok that sends death threats if you ship Sunflower, claiming that it is "glorifying toxic relasionships"...
I don't ship Sunflower, but I feel neutral towards those people who do. And yeah, Twitter is really toxic.
Yeah Twitter is the literal meaning of toxic in all things concerned.. . I don't really ship Sunflower... unless it's under new meanings of headcanons, but my usual is Sunburn respectfully
I don't think it would be toxic per-se but it has MANY issues, mainly due to them still being uncomfortable and distraught after the true ending.. . They'd still have time to recover so they couldn't really date let alone handle eachother's company much so yeah not toxic... just complicated
Like people can't enjoy drawing/writing/reading about toxic relationships.  Which I understand isn't even the point, but why we gotta be so Puritan UwU about this stuff.
ha. puri-tan
I hate sunflower ship though 
Yes, but prefer Sunflower
I like sunflower because it’s cute and I don’t like to think about any potential implications
I don't hate it, it's cute, but not necessarily my favorite. It might work in a way that their energies balance each other out, though. I find Sunflower a little cuter.
No because I dont like the dynamic and i think sunflower bette 
As a devil advocate, do you not see any of their hand holding as anything romantic. Cause as a Sunflower shipper that's probably my biggest evidence
I do but I love sunflower more
I do, though I usually go for Burnt Sunflower.
No, because it wouldn't actually work and it was a childhood crush that doesn't have enough strength to keep the relationship together. I can respect people who ship it and I won't tell them they can't as long as they also respect people have their own opinions, as a sunflower shipper I understand how it feels to be gatekeeped when shipping (I swear if any of you tell me it's toxic I will write a full essay im so tired of people saying that).
they will make sunflower canon
#OH HELL YEAH
*GOOD*
Make Sunflower Canon, and I'll learn to live with it.
**Insert weird Sunflower Prompt here:** /j
Let’s see how Sunflower fans will react when bro gets stabbed in Red Space.. . Edit: You guys are messed up, Jesus Christ
They'd probably like it? (I'm a sunflower fan)

🍉
Sunflower fan here, and I can guarantee that we'll enjoy it. 
As a Sunflower enjoyer, I'm okay with this.
Live laugh Sunflower 
ofc you get a sunflower post card with it too
We know there is prolly gonna be a ton of Sunflower, so we have to take the little victories!
Yeah I feel like there's probably a couple scenes coming up, the hug especially where were gonna be cheering
sunflower canon? ;)
Sunflower deniers in shambles
Nope.
Doesn't really help that they also put a lot of sunflower in official stuff, only serving to fan the flames. and if I know Omori's creator as well as I think I do, this is VERY deliberate.
Of course is deliberate, shipping sells a lot (both the fandom one and the literal shipping costs)
Esp the more toxic sunflower shippers
sunflower is life
Couldn't agree more
sunflower fans eatin good
SAMEEEE. . r/sunflower it has to exist
I fucking hate sunflower🙁. I don’t think I’m gonna enjoy the mangz
that's your opinion, look for your like-minded friends and keep hating sunflower ship with them. you should feel better after that 
Grazie molto comrade🫡
I prefer sunflower but this is peak ‼️
Closest we have to sunflower canon
Every month we get a the closest we have to sunflower being canon I think we can allow ourselves to accept it already
I meant bff. Sunflower ain't canon
Shoots sunflower seeds from 300m on a roof
You are a based person. No ship is healthy in this game unless everyone has recovered mentally and emotionally.. . (As the only Daisy [Sunflower Shipper] here, what I'm saying is pretty hypocritical.)
a big win for sunflower fans
hmm that’s still a better ship than Sunflower 😂😂
How would you rate the titanic? I think it's a bad ship
yeah man, it sucked. i prefer the olympic.
Good ship 👍
yeah bro the titanic sucks as a ship
Yeah. Everyone except it's makers said it was unsinkable. That was a lie
same, would root for USS Arizona
Better love story than twilight
SunFlower is no longer canon.
Sunflower debunked lmao
I dont know exactly what happened, but why does this always need to happen. Seriously why cant we just respect other opinions if its not hurting anyone.. . If its Sunflower, I know people misunderstand what we actually are shipping, but I can tell you like 95% of the other sunflower shippers I've encountered all just want the bois to heal and be happy together. I hate that it's a controversial thing because for me, I usually just ship what has the most likely chemistry, which was sunflower in this case, because I sure as hell wasn't shipping suntan (it made me way too uncomfortable to consider it).. . Any of the other shit I have no clue because reddit didn't want to show me any of it. So if there is more important wars here I would love to know eats going on.
Ya sick, rotten sunflower seed
here comes the sunflower art
Sunflower shippers:It's showtime
a home for flowers (sunflower) is one of my favorites
🟪
A Home for Flowers(Sunflower)
. . Fellow Phobia By Airneko. . And A home for Flowers (Sunflower). . I used to sleep to this ngl
Her name is sunflower !
Insert "get on bloons" gif
yes I need more mods about cactiflower/sunflower there aren't any 
[This one's pretty sunflower-heavy]()
Unfortunately, I think there isn’t a Sunflower mod yet. The most popular is Senesce which is probably taking a break now. For another ship mod though, you can try Pink Tinted Love, a Sunburn mod
augh
Sad for Sunflower fans(including me). . 
as a sunflower fan, i like it as more of a “but what if everything WAS ok” concept, but in terms of canon pppfft yeah no sunflower will never be healthy
I'd like to think that they would be able support eachother through therapy. It would definitely take a couple of years before a romantic relationship between then could be healthy though. Sunnflower fics that start with then being platonic and then slowly lead up to a romantic relationship are best.
Can’t help but agree
I think it could theoretically be healthy if both of them just get some fucking therapy and then start dating when they're both in a better place mentally.
Sunflower
wait its a sunflower 
sunflower real? :0
the sunflowers look like eyes 🌼🌼 creepy.
*Posts an AMV of the SunFlower ship set to "Crawling In My Skin" by Linkin Park, poorly made in Windows Movie Maker.*
the sunflower fans are shaking right now. (Including me)
Wait I just realised this was posted on pride month-
im shaking rn
Lol
As a multi shipper who also ships sunflower, I don’t think people fully understand this post. From my understanding omocat probably just saw people shipping sunflower and was surprised people were already shipping three characters so early in the game.
YEAS SUNFLOWER
Noooooooooooooooo it had to be sunflower

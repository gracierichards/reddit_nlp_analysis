Nice idea! Will implement later!

Huh, kinda nice easter egg.

It should be able to parse any close comment as long it's the only alphanumeric char in there.. . . For example, closes is rejected, close your eyes is rejected, close is accepted
Yup, figured that much. Good bot, thanks!
Good human.
Bot? 
If you didn't make a bot, then... Good person you locked in your basement and forced to write thousands of comments! You trained them well
Ah haha I thought that comment was for me 
Oh whoops, I meant that you made a good bot.. . That being said, good human!
Сlose your eyes and mouth.
Hmmmm, what if I say. . Close your eyes instead 
Oh no this bot is too smart 
I settled for the bot to only find close by itself, not close your eyes, closet or close123.

Femboy absolutely almost is exclusively used in a sexual context. I won't deny some people see it as innocent, but for the most part that isn't the case. . >I've never seen anyone use "daddy" in a non-sexual context. . So when kids call their parents "daddy" or "mommy" you immediately think it's sexual??? Wtf is wrong with you. You know what, nvm. After this I'm not wasting my time with you. You're weird ah for thinking that way.. . . >Ig flower crowns are the peak of masculinity now.. . You heard it here men, you can't like gardening without being labeled as a feminine man. Didn't you know gardening is a hobby exclusive to women?

i've always thought about using mods, but never got around to it because i don't know where to start or if it's even worth my time. what mods do you recommend if you don't mind answering?
Reverie
i thought it's not completed though?
It isn't, but 1st part is pretty good so far (you can play the demo)
ah alright, thanks
As a wise king once said, "The suffering of others is the most amusing thing there is!" I mean, why else would the fandom love memes like the pizza or watermelon memes? Why else would there be such angsty fanfictions like the pursuit AU? Why else would there be Shitpost covers of final duet and my time?
Because those covers and memes are funny, and because Pursuit is a great story with all that angst. The idea for a fanfic you had earlier is just disgusting and beyond good taste.
Sure, go ahead. I’ve probably seen worse from my time in r/cursedomori.. . . Edit: I take it back. Who the fuck actually sat down, drew that abomination, and thought it was okay to post online?

Thank you for not letting the oyasumi comment thread just be the beginning. It was pretty close tbh
Latin America? I'm from fucking Italy. That shop doesn't even exist here. Feeling sad right now, might commit oyasumi
In Latin America it's the same, we only have the most famous food chains like Mc Donalds, but nothing else from US. Not even a good comic store with Omori merch ;-;
Here in Brazil we have piticas, it's a good comics and games store but unfortunately I've never seen an omori shirt or any indie game
In Britain, they basically say: “Hey! You can order these things from the US! Isn’t that great? For shipping, it’s the low low price of £30 for regular shipping (6-10 weeks) or £100 for deluxe shipping (2 weeks)! So we can get merch, but only after selling one if our limbs on the black market.
Makes me want to say >! oyasumi world !<

To be honest I can relate. I have Maladaptive Daydreaming, and I always spent my time in a safe zone that isn't related to reality. People constantly tell me that I should pay more attention to reality but I'm too scared to face it. I prefer to stay in my own world 
Same.  . Tho I have a very active imagination but not Maladaptive daydreaming (I didn’t even know what it was and I had to go read about it which was really cool I know it has its ups and downs but I think it can really help in Art and writing ) but when I can’t imagine the space I want I cope with it by doing some Art or Gaming.
It can be really useful for Art (coming from an artist) but sometimes it might just make everything else a troublesome task. Like paying attention to class, coming up with solutions, doing chores and other things in general , but it's useful when you have free time and you're bored
Omg maladaptive daydreaming buddy!!
YESSS
I don't think I have maladaptive daydreaming, but I can still relate to this a lot, in class (if I even go) or whenever I get the chance I'll start daydreaming and I'd much rather do that instead of facing reality

Put the more energetic part of My Time over it it fits really well.
not the Japanese text spelling "oyasumi"💔
Just kidding in here but like I remember in a bo en stream (not canon but funny nonetheless) where he just said that it all takes place in the UK (probably a joke). IIRC it was the Stop AAPI Hate stream
Your eyes are beautiful.. . ALSO IF I SEE ONE DELETED COMMENT WHEN I SCROLL DOWN YALL ARE FUCKED
Thank you !🥰 And what do you mean ?🤣
None of them were deleted, we're not fucked yet
Why would some commenta be deleted ?🤔
Well, i expected people to be racist tbh. Guess we aint that bad tho
That's why mods exist x)
Mhm, to my knowledge tho you can see if mods deleted a comment, that's what i meant 
This is mostly true but some subreddits hide them, meaning they won't show up unless someone replied to it pre-removal. I don't think that's how it's set up on this subreddit though, it just says [removed].
Ohhh ok, thanks for explaining 
You’re welcome

Q “Look… he has your eyes…”. . . B(now alone) “They are full of fear.”
Yeah, that's one of his lines, not my favourite but ok
Oh for real? That's one of my favorites personally. Do you have a particular line you like?
(I just realized that my previous comment sounds a bit dry, sorry for that). . I'm obsessed with the setup to the first battle in the game, walking into an empty room and stating:. . > Show yourselves, corrupted children. I am the voice of forgiveness that will eliminate your calamitous forms.. . And suddenly be surrounded by enemies. Then, looking at the screen, he drops my favourite line:. . > Prepare yourselves to suffer my judgement.. . And you hear that awesome battle theme for the first time.. . . I also must say the dialogue you quoted is also great, it's scary how confident he is in what he's about to do
>This zone, deprived of its guardian, is now destined to disappear.... . >And the men who live here, whether they deserve it or not, will fall into nothingness, never to return.

Bo en (You know, the My Time guy) released a sequel to his first and most popular album for its decade anniversity. . It's really good.
Sounds cool, thanks for the info!
you dare say this is better than omori lore???. . oyasumi yourself... NOW  /j
"go Oyasumi yourself". . . . This is an Omori joke.
That explains the sudden gun shot in "my time"
I'mma sing two or three lines. . Soyuz Nerushimi. . And . . Close your Eyes
the only thing it needs is an oyasumi somewhere
There is! That's what the Japanese text is (おやすみ)
omori is the reason i can read exactly four japanese characters
Oyasumi!
Ngl it's my time to go, I liked the game and that's why I joined this subreddit but I'll be leaving since the games long over and this is the best content the subreddit will get until it dies out.
So basically moving out is the best ending because everything else is oyasumi
Is life without joy really better than death?
depends on one's point of view, i personally think yes bc theres basic stuff like breathing that i cant do while dead and i like breathing, it's fun most of the times
bro breathing in the cold air while drinking a hot chocolate 
The crispy nose feeling after sleeping in a cold place
Who said that the neutral endings will result in a life without joy?
Well IF AND HARD IF he would be to open up to a therapist he would properly get better like 70%?
I mean he would feel joy in the dream world

I'd say My Time's sequel/remix Our Time by Bo En (the beat drops in it are so good), but that's not really an OMORI song is it  but it's related in a way!
It’s not really a omori song but our time by Bo en it’s basically just a remix of my time
Ofc my time

Wow, did you make this specifically for this post or did you already make this previously? Either way super impressive!
Made specifically for this post, because it gave me Inspiration. Thank you!
I just wish people discussed the game more.... . It's always either. . ">!Why didn't they call the cops!?! Are they stupid?!<". . or. . ">!Do you think they forgave them?!<". . Like these questions have been answered a million times and the game has more nuance than just that.. . The stereotype of this fandom housing many people that didn't even play the game is immensely true, and that might be the result of the surface level knowledge of the lore that most people have here.. . But you know, at least this community is tame compared to the likes of others. I'm sorry for complaining but if I see another "murder suicide" post I'm gonna oyasumi.
well there arent any rules about posting the same question over and over technically and i also find this subreddit really tame and calm and friendly 
Yeah, you're right. . . Its not really a valid complaint on my end, I just wanted to vent a little.

>!they both oyasumi!<
>!My time!< (the part where it becomes utter chaos)
best part
Late as Hell, but don't lista to our time. It's a bola btw
think many ppl will hate me for this -every time a Japanese phrase pops up in My Time. i personally dislike the English accent a lot, so kikuo’s version is so much better
i dont know any japanese so i dont know what the accent should sound like but i laugh whenever bo en sings the japanese because its just so funny to me that this heavily british sounding guy is singing in japanese for a game thats (maybe) based in america 
yea its the heavy british accent in the japanese killing me 😭
Hot take: i kinda don't fw the 'oyasumi' part of my time... I mean I don't skip it but like honestly, the song couldve been wayy better.
(im lying just look at the username)
My time. . I really like the piano Waltz rhythm in the first part and it fits really well, but the airhorn part is really cheap and it sucks. . . . . Unrelated but anybody else think the first part in final duet is too rushed? Like the transition of the piano run and the other parts, and the piano run itself?. . It didn't really give enough time to let the scene sink in : <
Never let bro have an oppinion again 😭🙏
Wdym this is literally the most popular opinion why am I getting downvoted ????
Mythomania
Heard "my time" and reverse searched it, thought the trailer was pretty cool, and now here we are (´͈  ᵕ `͈ ）
i saw the first vid of “my time” like 2-4 years after it released
Bo en has been a fave of mine for years and he promoted rhe game on his insta
I saw the oldschool "my time" remix trailer while looking up a different song by Bo En ("miss you"), which I had come across through Pandora.. . The style and vibe had me hooked.
From what I remember I saw "My time" in my recommendations on YouTube, then I heard about the Ranboo controversy? I'm not sure if it counts as a controversy or not to be honest. I just remember a lot of people discouraging him to play the game due to misinformation or somethin, so I figured to look into it cuz what could be the problem.
Either seeing it mentioned in the comments of a SoundCloud upload of My Time or witnessing the controversy regarding the game not having enough warnings
I found an 8-bit cover of My Time, and seeing the characters on the cover art I had the crackpot idea that the story was about someone trying to transition.. . I then got a few more video recommendations and got the whole plot and proceeded to watch a playthrough during which I cried several times.
Somewhere a few months ago i heard 'my time' and when i watched the whole video (also with final duet) i decided to play this game and after weeks of deciding if im gonna play this game, just 2 months ago i bought it. This makes my first time buying a game.
Some years ago I watched the first trailer for the game, forgot about it for some time but would think about Bo En's My Time, then one day just saw the game on Steam a month or so after it had released.
I listened to "my time" often more or less since the omori version was released and one day noticed the game was released.
My time
I found it by listening to an animation meme of bo en's everyday, then listening to my time. I saw Omori being referenced in the comments as well as seeing a trailer for 2020 in the recommendations. I fell in love at first sight.
i think it was like youtube's mixes, got bo en's my time and i likes it
i was a bo en fan since 2014 and came across the omori trailer bc i listened to my time a lot and now we’re here
in the comments of my time. everyone was talking about omori so i got it and played it blind
I listen to my time and saw all the comments talking about it
im a fan of bo en 👍👍 so
Saw the 2014 trailer, thought it was neat, forgot about it cuz of kickstarter.. . Saw it on Steam in 2019, saw the trailer again, wishlisted it, forgot about it once again because it hadn't dropped.. . Saw the 2020 trailer, freaked out cuz I actually remembered, waited until December to buy the game day of.. . Edit: Also binging Bo En back in 2017
heard of it from multiple sources, mostly "My time"'s comment section. one day i saw that a french YouTuber i liked made a let's play of the game so i decided to watch it, but after a few hours i though to myself"ughhh this guy takes so long to finish the game! it'll be faster if i play it myself!" so i bought it. this was in July. we're in November, I'm 72hours in on my main savefile and i still haven't finished the game oh lord
back when i was a 10 year old i was listening to my time, and then i found the Omori trailer (i thought it was gonna be some sort of cool puzzle game like OneShot) and then i forgot about it. Found the trailer again a few years later and found out the game is out.
Listened to My time and all the comments were about Omori, so I checked it out
I found a "my time omori version" video because I listened to my time a lot in like 2016
Bo en got me recommended on Spotify
i found it by listening to bo en – "my time" and one of the comments made a joke about omori, the next week i realise it's in the xbox game pass and i have it so i kinda just yeah  uhm

>if yesterday and today consisted of you talking most about him. . Wtf do you mean, i spend most of my time here commenting on normal posts, without bringing any of that up 💀 did you count the comments or somethin? Or have any proof of that? If you're so confident with that then I'd like to see some numbers or proof, not just throwing out random BS. . . I mean hey, if mods ban me for calling out a prominent member of the community for sexualizing children, that says more about them and how this sub is run than anything. Siding with proshippers won't make them look very good

\^\^\^ This. It's a common misconception when you're a kid to think that when you die, your eyes close like you're sleeping, when in fact, your eyes stay open due to your muscles relaxing. That shit must have haunted Sunny and Basil to see Mari suddenly awaken and stare straight at them, shaking their entire perception of what death really entails. There's no way that small detail was put there as simply an abstract allegory.
Well, the only thing I can say is FUCK
Bit late but, when you die, your eyes open due to the muscles relaxing
Your eyes

Can someone fill me in?
Pedro Silva and Jami Lynne made almost all the music for OMORI.. . bo en made I believe a couple other songs besides My Time. It is also worth mentioning My Time was not made specifically for OMORI; it belongs to one of bo en's albums called Pale Machine. It's a really good album, by the way.
Do you know which of them is behind the Otherworld tracks like You Were Wrong Go Back, Lovesick-80000 light years and Stardust Diving? Given the motifs I’d assume all 3 are by the same person.
Ditto, what does it mean?
Fill me in too please.
I like how everyone knows the context wordlessly
Omori fans communicate trough dreamspaces, there's no need to use words.
*Oh really? Let me check your Headspace...*. . NOOOOO
**You shouldn't Have done That...**
Oh ok so now I *have* to buy Omori on the switch
ok now i have to buy the switch and omori on it
i now to buy on switch and it have the omori ok
oh yeah what a shame it would be i hope no one does that ha ha
Oh fuck no Bo En you wouldn't dare. . . It's on boys, the Switch version will have more content
Awesome! There’s some scenes that use a repeat track that I feel need their own tracks.
Oh bo en, how you spoil us
Bro, Us pc players are getting done dirty for playing early.☹
hardly! If anything the OMORI team is getting done dirty for selling their game for only $20. This is the best experience I've ever been given with a game and I will gladly give them more than I already have.
any new content in the switch version will 100% get ported back into the pc version by modders
what. . what now
I hope it isn't exclusive to Switch but cool either way lmao
“for the switch version” implies it’d be exclusive haha. Hopefully they put it on Spotify like the rest of the OST so you can listen to it if you don’t have a Switch
Hell yesssss
My mental health is in danger
Bo en coming in clutch
This actually reminds me of the time when someone played Megalovania in time to/for the new year
Wasn't that in 2020

Hello and thank you so much for remembering me!
I swear, I thought latias was an amogus plush 💀
Pretty good, as always
The only thing that is missing to this video is a plush of me! Anyways, I love your cover!
AAAA NO WAY ARE YOU ACTUALLY LATTICE I FREAKING LOVE YOUR COVERS SO MUCH AAAAA
Wow, that is sooo impressive! You absolutely crushed it, it's amazing! Also I love that lil yellow-ish plushie on the left, so cute!
That moment when actually talented posts like this get massively overshadowed by stolen fanart of the main characters
Nice (like your plushies btw)
Yo that's fucking cool
Best cover I have ever seen!
SO FRIGGIN AWESOME
Oh hey. It’s the person that did that cover of death by Glamor. Great work
Holy shit this is so amazing how long did it take you to learn the piece?
This is absolutely amazing, seriously, keep it up!! ♡
How is this even possible
Your hands, your hands , your hands they are literally 2× speed , such gracefulness 100/10
Due to reddits absolutely garbage video player the sound of this still played while the next post of the “there’s a pipe bomb in your mailbox” meme played
Woah this is amazing! Would it be ok if i downloaded and  use it in my playlist?
Certainly, but I’m hoping to get the full version released soon!. . Edit: Sorry nevermind, this IS the full version!!
>!i hope you don't have a younger brother who plays violin!<
No freaking way they animated the fingers correctly!!!!1111111 /j

omg this is awesome !! i recognized you from somewhere (dont ask) and realized youre the person who played that awesome spider dance/death by glamour cover, ive rewatched that one so many times haha
Damn, you're good. Fantastic job on the cover.
Ngl when i listen to this i feel like:
This is so cool! 
this is mindblowing
Lattice never disappoints 
Mari if she created the instrumental for my time
Oh my gosh this is amazing!! You’ve got me wanting to take piano lessons again haha 
No my time or duet in top 5 smh
Depends on what you listen to. I mostly listen to the boss themes, so I'm fine, but others listen to Duet, My Time and Dear Little Brother…

OH MY GAH! I’ve been wanting this for a long time! Glad to see it’s finally here! . . I wonder why he would drop the instrumental version now, of all other times… (It’s probably not for any specific reason)
I think it's because the entire Pale Machine album was re-mastered recently 
Oh really? Woah! I had no idea! Thanks, I will totally check that out! 
And it looks like the remaster is because its approximately the 10 year anniversary of the original album :)

Your daughter has good taste, I hope she doesn't make the Oyasumi ending.
hello. I believe you received a ton of notifications from this post already, but i just want to clarify that you shouldn't be worried about your child.. . This game brings up some dark ideas, but they aren't the thing that everybody loves and recognises the omori for. It's not an accident that omori is very popular within young teenagers. The whole thing that everybody loves about this game is basically it's idea of utopia. . . Nostalgia is the main focus of the game's plot and cute, not really detailed artstyle plays in this motif's hand. Even though the game is about not-really-childish topics, it focuses on cute and positive aspects much more. . . The description, plot and genre of the game tell everything about the process of it, but not about the FOCUS. . . I was 15 when i played it. It became a tribute to my friend group and motivated me to go and grab that human interaction!. . Hope I didn't waste my time writing this :(. . Edit: upon reading this i realised that even though the game's focus was definitely positive, it was positive FOR ME. Still, I wouldn't be cautious for mental health if you ask me

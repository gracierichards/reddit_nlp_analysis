I bought the Mari one, I didn't know how quickly it would sell out but the full shirt spread caught my eye lol
Just like Sunny and Basil caught Mari's eye
🥲
😑
Same
>!Wait, are we actually getting grown up Mari content?!!<
Not canonically.
yeah but m a r i
What's bothering me tho is that Mari's hair doesn't look purple but at the same time it does-
Is she a dream? Is she not? Who knows!!!
i love that mari's hair is ambiguously purple! she's so lovely
mari ;-;
I was actually so sad when I saw mari because I thought this was cannon
YAAAAAASSSS IT WAS MARI INDEED
I thought its was an imagen of everyone after the good ending, but if Mari is there, its just means its not the after of the good ending.. I still love it tho, i buy the postcard.
Wait thats Mari’s ghost or
wait, did mari dye her hair purple in this image like she said she would? I'm not good at seeing purples, I see them more black or blue
If Mari stood 1ft to the left
They got to have fun with Mari one last time…
Damn, if Mari is on the merch, that means the characters aren't at all like they are in game. Kind of makes me less inclined to buy it, cause these are entirely different characters now.
cringe, mari should be dead
THE OMORI SUBREDDIT became FURIOUS!. . THE OMORI SUBREDDIT used BANISH!. . THE OMORI SUBREDDIT dragged you into Downvote Space!. . Did 9999 damage!
It ain’t a fandom without the edge lords
and it aint a fandom without a toxic hivemind that attacks anyone that doesnt go with whatever ideology has been set up
cringe, you should be dead
you guys are way too attached to a fictional character
i originally thought this community was really wholesome and welcoming but now i just know that anyone that doesnt join the hivemind gets told to die
~~I mean saying “cringe Mari should be dead” isn’t really wholesome when the alive option is much more wholesome~~
>!but, he meant as a cannon poster, mari is literally dead in the story!<
just being canon 😎😎😎😎
Canon isn't the ultimate truth dude, AU's are popular for a reason, and fanfiction. . Death of the author and all that. . Though here the author is breaking their own canon
There’s a reason why headcanons exist, canon is a term **ONLY** used to describe a part of a franchise that the original writer wrote/made, not what is the truth
>Death of the author and all that. . that is not what death of the author means . . > Canon isn't the ultimate truth dude, AU's are popular for a reason, and fanfiction . . i actually really agree with that, fiction is fiction to begin with so you can shape a story however you like, it is your to enjoy anyways
i always thought that was what death of the author meant, never actually looked it up though, my bad
dont worry, i also thought it meant like that the first time i heard about it
Bro, they are just downvotes, chill lol
“I thought this community was really wholesome”. . “cringe, mari should be dead”
Thing is, your comment looked quite rude and many people disagreed so they downvoted you. . And the person who said that was imitating what you said, while if they were actually saying what they thought it would surely have been worrying-. . But still, that’d be one person, not the whole fandom, so why’d you make it that?-
“Man this place isn’t welcoming saying it’s cringe that a beloved character isn’t desd”
he meant that it would be better if the art was about the cannon ending
Still tho, + I believe he added a comma in his comment so it made that theory more plausible, but still, the original comment being “cringe Mari should be dead” would more come off as my understanding of it more tbh
In a world where Mari survives.🥹
wait why is mari alive
Anyone else wonder why Mari’s hair isn’t purple
yea that sumarizes the fight
>!Mari's body was found there's two imposters Among us!<
This looks AMAZING I'd like to see a Mari version drawn in this style as well
i'm actually working on a drawing of her rn so yea :)
yooooo I can’t wait to see it! I have to turn on your twitter notifications for this! 🤝
Exactly. They were just kids afraid of being punished/hated and Hero knows how much Sunny loves Mari. He would never intentionally kill her. I'm sure he'd be mature enough to understand that and realize Mari's death was just a really unfortunate accident.
I love this interpretation! I think there’s a weird sort of expectation that endings (and themes? characters? subplots? more?) have to be black and white (heh), good or bad, that there has to be a clear delineation of things, but that’s really.. not the case. I think it really adds to the narrative, for it to not be a perfectly/complete happy end for all (obviously, it couldn’t be, given the fact that Mari’s dead, but even setting that aside).
(I just beat the game and decided to browse the sub, so sorry for a 20 day late reply) I completely agree with you actually. It really feels like there's a whole missing chapter of Sunny's character development to justify an outburst against Mari. It's much easier to forgive Aubrey almost killing Basil because we see and understand both of them as characters. But all we know about Sunny is that he's introverted, and a throwaway line that dream Mari says about pushing him too hard with the violin. Even if it was an accident, I just cannot fathom what compelled Sunny to push Mari. Not to mention what compelled both him and Basil to drag her (possibly still alive) body back up the stairs, into a bedroom, formulate a plan to stage a suicide, and finally execute said plan instead of trying to find help. Not to mention the difficulty of physically pulling off the staged suicide. Really weird twist in my opinion, I think it being a suicide would have been enough of a twist on its own, but maybe that was the intention all along. It just really leaves such a bad taste in my mouth that Mari literally did nothing wrong.
You’d be surprised what anger, stress and panic will make you do, at that point, you’re emotions have absolute control over you. And remember, we don’t know what was said when Mari confronted Sunny about the violin, nor the majority of what happened before that point.
[This might help, though it was unused. so take it how you want.]()
Thank you for the link. I think it does provide more context, and now I'm more comfortable with the fact that the whole event could have happened. I think the game could have done a slightly better job at showcasing Mari's perfectionism (though it would have been difficult because of the whole unreliable narrator stuff) and Mari's bad knee, but I've otherwise come to terms and forgiven Sunny. Which I guess is the whole point of the game. All I can say at this point is good job Omocat
>(I just beat the game and decided to browse the sub, so sorry for a 20 day late reply) . . Yeah 10 months late doing the samw lmao
Yep, this is the take I’m on board with. Obviously, a huge part of, well, everything, is the fact that Mari’s Gone, but it’s not everything. Survivor’s guilt and the horror of (thinking that) you could’ve known and prevented it, would undoubtably be extremely heavy, and to know that it was an accident (albeit with someone clearly at fault) largely relieves that.
Don’t forget the fact Hero was blaming himself for Mari’s “suicide”... Since her death he was everyday breaking his head looking for memories that could give an hint of suicidal behavior on Mari.. Thinking “how it was possible? how i didn't have realize about it before?”. ... So, is more than forgive Sunny and Basil for the murder, it’s forgiving them for the lie and making feel them guilty about Mari’s death
You just know the only thing he said was "I killed Mari" lol
I think Mari took her "Prank" too far...but EXTREMELY far.
yeah, They are going to feel deluded and disappointed with Mari, ¡girl pretending your death is not funny!.
no no, see, the >!pushing mari down the stairs!< it was just a goof it was just for laughs like haha why aren’t you laughing
>!This raises a lot of questions, where did Mari go? How did she survive? Did she go to the city and start a new life? Who came up with the idea that they would prank the rest of the group by faking Mari's death? Was basil apart of it? I'd not, did they have to improvise the get Mari down from the tree? When and how did sunny get in contact with Mari, was not leaving his house for 4 years apart of the prank? Why specifically 4 years after her "death" did they finally decide to pull the curtain. And finally, how in God's name did Mari get into that hospital. Then again, I'm elaborating on a meme so who really won in the end?!<
Their parents were probably in on the joke and she just moved in with her dad.
Yes, the parents were also accomplices
well I'll just put what I think about this:. . \-maybe she stayed in an apartment in the city with her father (since quite possibly the parents were also part of the "Prank").. . \-maybe she fakes her hanging with some trick (something similar as revealed in the sherlock holmes movie).. . \-It was Mari's idea, that's very obvious.. . \-I don't know if Basil was also an accomplice or not, that to each one with their interpretation of that.. . \-the part of how they improvised to get Mari down from the tree to be honest is a mystery to me...maybe it was the father or some anonymous helper...the truth is that I don't know.. . \-It could be that Sunny secretly maintains contact with Mari during those four years, and is very possibly that his isolation was part of the "Prank".. . \-maybe they decided to reveal everything since they saw that their(Mari) "Prank" went too far.. . \-Mari pretends to be a patient so she could easily infiltrate in the hospital.. . Well what else can I say, Mari is going to be in serious trouble giving explanations and apologizing for such a "Prank"
Plot twist: Ghost Mari just materialised for April Fool's and is still dead.
Considering how he watched Ghost Mari play the piano with absolutely no ill reactions I think he'd just tell Mari to drop the act.
Hero: I BLAME ME FOR FOUR YEARS FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS ALL A JOKE!?...HOW DARE YOU MARI!? \*proceeds to leave the room running in tears of deception\*. . Mari: Oookey this did not turn out as well as expected.
Summarizing: >!If they not start running now Sunny will be forced to commit Oyasumi and Mari will fall from the stairs for real.!<
oh hahahahahahahahahahaha, Well in defense of Sunny he is just an accomplice for me that whole prank was Mari's plan so she is gonna pay the consequences.. . go for the pizza Mari because Hero and the others are waiting for XD
Do you think they will forgive MARI?
¿Faking her death for four years causing: trauma, depression, regret and loneliness all just for playing a joke?...NOPE...she is going to pay, Aubrey and Hero may end up disappointed with Mari for...this, and well Hero might break up with her (since her "joke" went too far).. . Mari is going to have to apologize for such a "joke".
Idk why but Mari just looks… off. Idk how to describe it
might be the ears? or shes alive? idk
It might be her pose . Or maybe she just looks too tall
oh my god mari XD
ok this is such a good pose though and i love that mari face so much
Mari went quiet for four years just for a joke, what commitment
They are all part of the prank too. Mari Is just drugging everyone and tricking them into thinking they are going on grand dream like adventures. Everyone actually thinks they are the ones dreaming too.
plot twist: mari is actually dead, she just is now on our world as a spirit
A small goof that went on for over 4 years. Its official mari is the absolute prank god.
the whole gang: ¡Mari you FOOL!
Hero: Mari.....go get the pizza.. . Mari: oh shit.
Rather she is going to hitting Mari since it was all Mari's idea (the "prank") and sunny is just her unfortunate (and obligated) accomplice.
Mari: (to Hero) Bit mean of me to spring it on you like that, I know. Could've given you a heart attack, probably still will but in my defence it was quite funny.. . Hero: *stares at Mari*. . Mari: Okay, maybe it's not a great defence.... . Basil: You're.... . Mari: Oh, yes.. . Basil: Oh my god.. . Mari: Mmm, not quite.. . Basil: You're >!dead!!<. . Mari: No. . . Basil: >!You're dead, you fell down a flight of stairs!!<. . Mari: No, I'm quite sure, I checked.
Aubrey and/or Hero: oh so that was all just a...prank, heh heh heh hahahahahahahahaha oh Mari you and your jokes =) \*proceed(s) to approach menacingly\*. . It was at this moment that Mari knew...she f\*cked up.
Plot Twist: Mari last ditch attempt to make everyone happy, before realizing she's floating because she's a spirit because she's dead
I mean that ending it's literally more worse than the Bad Ending. At least Mari isn't dead :)
Plot twist it's just someone who happens to look exactly like Mari
I didn’t know Mari had the Dead Ringer.
Ah. Now I would get to watch >!Mari fall down the stairs!< in full video? Ah yes. Pain, but 100x worse!. . In all seriousness, would FUCKING LOVE to see something like this.
>!the entire stairs incident on loop. . .now in HD!!<

>!And both of the fandoms' favorite joke/meme is about a character's death, and also both strangely having a food related thing in the meme portion of it.!<. . >!Pizza for MARI, and popsicle Berdly.!<
Also a banana-related meme in both.
Wait what since when did OMORI have a banana meme,,I’m missing out
It’s the Eternal Banana, you can find it in that Playground in Headspace.
OMORI Get The Banana.
Potassium overdose
Exactly, it's eternal, after all, the queen would love it as it is eternal
>!berdly deserved it!<
And mari comes back soon to visit her brother.
I hope Mari is happy, regardless of where she is.
Its a Game SPOILER ALERT 👉( tho yes she is in the ending in witch you tel your friends in the one where you jump off no in the one with leaving Bazil alone no chuse something is  there and the one where you stab in your sleap no sooooooo )
REMINDING YOU THAT YOU FORGOT TO SPOILER PROPERLY. . 
Every time I think about how Mari and Hero aren't able to be a loving couple in the game's real world I die a little more inside.
Me too. There is no pure happy end in Omori. Only big pain and little pain
That's what the game is about. Some mistakes can't be fixed.. . But we still need to move on. And if we're honest with ourselves, we can grow<3
Just finished and I'm so devastated about the perfect life they couldve had even if it was unrealistic

My thoughts will follow you into your dreams
THIS IS SO AMAZING
thank you!
The flowers were a nice touch
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD  . BUT IT' S SO SAD
Ouchies :( Amazing work though, holy goodness. I can't believe the individuals who epitomize talent casually waltz into the Omori fandom.

Oh no no no not here too
This scene made me think >! Mari would turn out to be a murderer and attack everyone or something, so I was super wary of her my first time through :D I guess I've played too many RPGmaker horror games with twist villains hah !<
Me too, I either thought >!Mari was going to try and kill Omori and his friends, or Basil would idk, do something since they felt both eerie. !<
MARI WHAT?! MARI IS WHAT!?
Is it just me, or does she look a lot like Mari?
Hey i just ordered some pizza to Polly
She is like Mari but but more motherly and older
>!and alive!<
True
the robot dog, instead of having a cool sword,. . has emotional trauma instead.. . it's a flail >!resembling Mari and jumprope!<
 I'm honestly not surprised to see you summarize our conversation in such a simple and misleading manner. It proves that you really are too young or too confused to have this conversation so I would prefer not to waste my time having it for a second time.  . . . >Oh use some context clues for once.. . I could say the same to you. Just because a friend thinks two people look cute together doesn't mean those two people are friends, dating, married or whatever. Seeing a comment on an insta post "you two look like a couple" doesn't mean the two people are a couple. That's just a bystanders opinion- a theory. The fact is that the bystander has no idea.  . Perhaps Mari and Hero are dating, and Basil is saying "A match made in heaven" with that in mind. Or maybe they're just really close friends because Hero and Mari don't want to come out as dating to their parents and Basil is just saying how heavenly they look in the photo.  . . . I could come up with countless theories that explain in great detail Mari and Hero's relationship as purely friendship, but personally I'm a HeroXMari shipper so it would be a waste of time.   . . . You should stop putting your time into this conversation. Go out and experience life, get in a few relationships and come back when you're at least 25. I think by that point you can probably understand what I've been trying to say to you.
Goddamnit alright I'm giving you this conversation because it's getting nowhere, and you continue to make condescending remarks that just show how confidently incorrect you are with any analysis of character writing. You just continue to make baseless claims.
>alright I'm giving you this conversation. . If I may ask, why do you think you're giving me anything? Or why would you use that verbiage as if you're conceding something? You nor I have lost anything but time at this point.  . It's so weird, like you were hoping to win an argument or something...
Holy fucking shit. Ok first off, it got autocorrected from "up" to "you", but second off either way it's common phrase and there's is absolutely no reason to be this pettily condescending. How old are you? You repeatedly call me young and yet you can't get off your high horse. . . And uh... yeah no shit I was hoping to convince you of how stupid you sound? Like seriously dude stop acting like you're above anything here you just sound pathetic.
Any high horse you see me in is just a mirror, my dude. You're super projecting your own insecurities onto me. I don't know you so I don't have much reason to think you're more or less than myself. I only have two theories about you, the ones I have already stated, and only one of them casts you in a negative way. I also lack experience in different ways. Why you think lacking experience on a subject would make you less than me is something I will never understand.  .    . I asked a simple clarifying question because it seemed like you were bothered by how this ended. Fortunately, it seems to be an auto-correct mistake so all's well that ends well.
See you're doing it again. You're trying to analyze me and it'd be adorable if it wasn't so annoying. Stop acting like you know shit about anyone over an internet argument, it honestly really is sad how highly you seem to think of yourself.
And yet you're analyzing me, calling me condescending with an inflated ego.   . Are you really blind to your own hypocrisy?  . . . As I have stated already, I don't know anything about you. I have my own thoughts but they're worthless if I've never met you. Strangely, however, you seem very concerned about my thoughts. So much so that you're trying to find condescension in my statements where there is none...
Calling out your tone is entirely different than trying to say who you are. And no, quit the bullshit. You know what you're doing and it's blatantly obvious.
You were literally calling me conceited and have been doing so for much of the conversation. That goes beyond calling someone out for their tone.   . . . I don't know what you think I'm doing, but I can guess it's pretty far-fetched from what I have actually been doing this whole time. The only obvious thing to me is how hard you're trying to project yourself or something made up onto me. Just let it go, you're only hurting yourself at this point.
Guy seriously gets called to their face about how much of a self-rightous prick they're being and still can't see it. You have not once considered the possibility you don't know what you're talking about, while I've gone to lengths to verify the info I argue with. Meanwhile you've just re-stated the same, incorrect point over and over while saying that the reason I don't agree with you is due to immaturity. You have not once argued in good faith. I'm not projecting shit and I'm not going to be gasllighted by some 20-something prick who thinks they know everything. . . >Just let it go, you're only hurting yourself at this point.. . Fuck you.
>not once considered the possibility you don't know what you're talking about. . This is something I do when someone has offered a more convincing perspective than my own, which I would have done if you ever offered one.   . Instead, you proclaimed a proposition to be true on the grounds of it being "obvious". If you cannot see the logical fallibility of that, I cannot have this conversation with you.  . I gave you the benefit of the doubt and assumed the soundness of your argument was because you're young or confused but I could assert a lack of intelligence as you've done to me. Or perhaps an inherent stunting of your cerebral cortex? or maybe an intention to waste time by being a contrarian?   . . . I can act as spiteful as you can if that's what you want.
Once again twisting your own words to try and remain on your high horse. Yeah sure buddy. It absolutely is obvious, as much as it was with our argument, and as much as it is now.
And once again, projecting your own insecurities onto someone else.  . Everything I've said is my own interpretation of what happened. How can I possibly twist it if I truly believed this is what occurred? You're making less and less sense...
God this is like talking to a brick wall.
The feeling is mutual.
>!Yeah, what people tend to forget, even if he did with good intentions, what he did in the end was hanging his own friend to "protect" another, letting everyone else in the believe Mari killed herself causing immense pain not just through loss but survivor's guilt as well !<
Exactly like he’s ”just” a boy who’s kind, likes flowers and photography and has severe anxiety/trauma. I understand if you don’t love him or smth but hating him? What?? . . >!They’re all victims of the trauma, Mari’s death wasn’t his fault. And the fact that he knew what hanging was ’should’ just make you feel even more bad for him if anything.. If that’s why you’d dislike him.!<
>!This little dipshit came in and thought the best course of action would be to cover up the crime in the most disgusting and disrespectful (to Mari and all her friends and family) way that just made everything much worse, I understand why Sunny didn't come up with the idea to call an ambulance, his mind just shattered at this point and even though Basil was traumatized as well he was lucid enough to stage a suicide that even fooled an expert instead of calling an expert that could have saved Maris life (in case she was still alive) !<
he was 12
Hello I am late and I would just like to say that >!she had no pulse!<
I'm dumb, thought that was Mari, down voted myself cuz I deserve it

I didn’t realize that Mari was in this picture. I have so many questions.
consider it a timeline where >!Mari realized Sunny was struggling and either reassured him that she didn't mind mistakes or postponed the recital!<
It was all an act, Mari isn't dead
Wait, REALLY?! Please tell me this is 100% confirmed…
Is this some timeline where Mari pulled an uno reverse and set her gamemode to creative?
It’s oficial art AND it has kel in it. . Omocat created a CANON Mari lives au

Oops, my bad.

Ayo
why marked as a spoiler?
A popular meme involving pizza and Mari that parodies a major plot point.
oh yeah, >!ayo the pizza here?!<
Correct.
There’s no recipe for Mari’s cookies because they’re impossible to make, even if you know how to make cookies they aren’t as good as Mari’s.
How am I supposed to ask Mari to make them?!?!
Ouija Board
I see.
Guys i don't think we can make mari cookies any more
>!well you wont ask mari now!<
I don't think I have the right ingredients for the Mari cookies
I can’t take Mari. She’s already taken so I’ll settle with the gators.

Gator guy ofcourse. Mari's already taken and I'm gay.
Gator guys will get me Mari so I’ll have both
everyone be like "i'll take gator guys because mari is taken/>!dead!<" but i will gladly take the gators over mari because theyre just clearly superior
Mari already taken so am I GATOR GUYS make me a pillow fort so I can cuddle with my gf
well Mari's taken so I'll just take the gator guys
That cat girlfriend looks an awful lot like Mari.. . As great as Mari is, I have to go with the gator guys.  Mari isn't my type.
i didn't know Cat Mari was canon. i thought this was only a fanart thing.. . Nice.
since mari is taken, I go with gator guys and since they are loyal I ask them to find me a catgirl
Mari is a child, Gator guys 100%
Hmmm.... . Hard to decide which I would choose so.... . Sorry Catgirl Mari, but I'm choosing Gator Guys!
if you pick mari you clearly haven't played the game
If I had the gator guys I could obviously just yoink Mari, so the decision is obvious
cat gf maris too cyte im sorry
Win for cat Mari
I'll go with the gators. 'Cause, you know.. Mari is.. yeah.
That's my enemy too >! I'm Mari with a knife !<
Dream Mari: hey where is my counterpart?
“she’s downstairs, Mari.”
BRUH
she went to get the pizza that they ordered
Dream Mari: >!Oh... a gravestone.!<
Oh that's a different mari, the other mari is . d o w n s t a i r s
 my life summarized
Yay you look so good as Mari  !
Thank you!!!
Very good job on the cosplay, you look spot on like her! And the wheelchair actually adds a cool detail to this cosplay considering Mari’s bad knee, I could see her using one to help ease it
if anyone doesnt like the wheelchair take it as an alternate universe where mari survived
Why.... Why would people have a problem with that? No offense but she isn't on that wheelchair because she wants
It makes me sad people have an issue with that. We should respect each other  .
Some people are just stupid 
Agreed. 
ngl i thought that was just part of the cosplay. omori best ending: nobody dies
Canon ending . . *Inhales copium*
Unfortunately not, it’s a need for me these days 😔
It’s unfortunate for you to have such needs, OP. Hope it won’t bother your life and have a bright future
Thank you so much
Or maybe just "fuck them"?. . /shrug
That's what I also thought!
Same
If anyone doesn't like the wheelchair they can go fuck themselves
The slightly better ending
That was immediately what I came up with. Mari survives falling down the stairs but loses most or all leg function
I mean the weak knee is canon so
Yeah I think this is the best cosplay you can do if you have a wheelchair because you can save Mari!!!!
\[Everyone liked that\]
I mean it isn't like it's invisible, at some point it will be mentioned, and to expect everyone to pretend it doesn't exist is just stupid. If there is going to be any comment made, at least they were attempting to be supportive... Some people like to take offense at things in place of others and blow things up into bigger deals than they really need to be, which is gross, and a real problem these days. You were the one who brought negativity into the conversation, regardless of the fact that it was coming from good intentions, try to do better.
An artist on instagram made that AU, I think, it already exists!
It's kinda fucked up that that's the first thing my mind went to. "This is the alternative universe where Mari got crippled rather than killed by Sunny"
This or she uses it as support because of her bad knee

LMAO WHAT IS THIS?!
omor👍
Nah, this ain’t that, it’s moroI
oreo?

why did I read that as 'you broke my leg'💀
dorime
we met again my sillyass omori art
I thought it was the middle finger💀
Close enough it's the index finger tbf
At first I thought you were making fun of Mari’s fall, which I thought was hilarious in a diabolical way, then I realized that you just have a wheelchair and then I felt bad, and then I realized that it makes your cosplay even better
Why is everyone assuming the wheelchair is part of cosplay instead of the far more natural assumption of them needing one?
Exactly it’s a need for me
1. Your cosplay looks great!. . 2. Inb4 someone comes and makes a certain ableist joke that involves some spoilers (I already have a pretty good idea of what the joke is, unfortunately).
mari took a selfie yall! HI MARI!
Beautifully done. 
An Omori themed picnic sounds so fun! You make a great Mari! ☺️
You look beautiful as Mari! :3
 It’s like you’re literally Mari if she >!survived the fall! !< Awesome cosplay, OP! It works on, like, double levels!
So cute. The picnic basket is like cherry on top.
THIS IS SO CUTEEEE. . XNSDPOCBIDVCMJESFVN AND YOU EVEN HAVE THE BASKET!!!

I like this. it looks good. i wonder what's in the basket.
I wonder what Hero would think about Sunny, u think Mari would tell him?
Is this real world or headspace?
Honestly I’m not even sure myself, maybe a bit of both lol
I love the cosplay
>!SHE SURVIVED THE FALL!!!!<
The good ending?
This is an awesome cosplay, good job 
CUTEST MARI EVER

That's so cute. Great cosplay 
cutie patootie
You are adorable oh my god my heart is exploding 💞
I love this.
It looks great! I also appreciate the fact that you have the picnic basket as a prop.
Dont let anyone insult you over your weight or disabilities. Just ignore them. Good work, good cosplay. Have fun!
That looks great! You even got the loose strand of hair that comes down. Is the wheelchair a disability aid or part of the cosplay? Hope you don't mind me asking :)
It’s fine. It’s a disability aid since I’m paralysed and can’t move otherwise
The responses were not what I was expecting
Mhm
It's excellent
I love itttt
UR SO BEAUTIFULL!!!!!!!
OMG YOUR COSPLAY IS SO AMAZING I LOVE IT!! BIBLICALLY ACCURATE MARI. . Edit: grammar/spelling
AMAZING COSPLAY!!! It brought me back to "Here comes the sun", a fanfiction AU where Mari is paralized from the waist down and Sunny is nonverbal
This cosplay rocks 🪨!
cool
The picnic basket is adorable omg (love the cosplay btw <33)
The good ending where she just gets crippled instead. Wonderful cosplay
Such a good cosplay \~ The wheelchair seems canon enough to me too\~
You're so pretty and so is the cosplay!! And the wheelchair fits mari aswell like pookie is mari irl atp 😭😭AWESOME COSPLAY THO GJ!! 
 Cosplay is so good, and the wheelchair makes it even better
The good ending
omg you look just like her! good job

Fantastic cosplay. IMO you killed it... I'll see myself out.
Awesome cosplay

. . Mari approves! ❤️
AU:- >!Mari survived the fall but was left bound to a wheelchair!<
Ngl man pretty damn weird to use a real wheelchair user as your AU fanfic shit.
She survived the fall! Beautiful cosplay bestie!
omori, but mari >!survived falling down the stairs and went to a wheelchair!<
Really good cosplay 10/10, I apologise in advance >!Mari fell down the stairlift in this au!<
Cool! Was there life-jam?
Goddamn it man, fyuck uou
This could be the Good Timeline Au where Mari didn't...y'know.
Who is this character?
U look like that one girl that made me a grilled cheese back in 2018
U single
Happy ending!!!!!
Clever, but a hearse would’ve been more accurate. Good job though!
im holding back so many roasts rn
say em no balls
i will get banned  😢
I’m literally paralysed I need the wheelchair to move it’s not a prop
Have you considered that some irl people need wheelchairs too?. . Like, for example, the one making this post?
I love it, the art style reminds me of that comics of Toad asking Mario his fears and piano
Well, more material for Omari au.
Alternate au . . Mari is in a coma and Sunny is burdened by a mountain of guilt and the dream world is created but Mari is in it too!!.
YOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD SHIT GOOD SHIT RIGHT THERE
YEAHHHHHHHHH
omari
“Would you like to have a picnic with MARI (aka best girl)”. . 👉🏻yes. . no. . 🥲 it’s getting kinda hot in her my eyes started sweating
I didn't noticed there was a second image, so i was just trying to undersrand what was missing frim mari picnic
the positions of the objects on mari’s picnic blanket are in the same positions as the objects in whitespace
Omari
I swear we need a word for the genre of games like omori, undertale, mother, paper mario, mario&luigi, oneshot, etc. u can’t just say “rpg” because it’s too broad but there’s no other word. the specific things I can think of that they all have in common are so limited, but one is that you can’t rotate the camera manually? idk someone come up with a word
RPG should rightfully refer to those kinds of games. Imo it's only an RPG when it has a coherent plot and does not overly focus on exploration (like the modern Zelda games).  . . . Edit: involves some sort of battle system, functional or vestigial
but i personally think oneshot fits into the category I’m making in my head and it doesn’t have battles
Omari was pretty good. I thought the game play was Abit meh but the story was the best.
Mario in half life movie
Roblox avatar in the portal movie
V.iv Rusty in the Elden Ring movie
wh-what would be mari!?  (seriously clueless)
Mari is, obviously.
Back to crying I guess.
BEAUTIFUL ART 😭
I love this! You’re a fantastic artist!
Mari. BD: March 1. Shorten it it’s Mar 1. . Mar 1 = Mari. . Now my brain hurts
Your art is always great man!
I love how you included all the flowers, nice one
Love this 🥺!!!
I will die for her
Really like your style !! Do you have a Twitter ?
[here!]()
So beautiful!!!👌😊👍
Could someone make this wider for a computer screen background? This art is absolutely beautiful!
So beautiful!
Love it
Love it!
This is sooooo pretty
Amazing
gorgeous<3 love the colors and your soft style
I LOVE THIS
I found something worthy to download and save, this is so beautiful
It would be perfect is Mari's hair was purple
Kinda looks like dark purple if you focus hard enough
looks like blue if you hold your breath long enough
r/cursedcomments
What would >!Mari!< call this?
"That's gonna be a yikes from me, dawg"
That or "I will give you a singular yike"
an oopsie
Uhhhhh you aren't wrong
“💀”
A real back breaker
a 
Mari would call a mistake a slip up
>!More like a slip down!<
oh
Oof lmao
Lmao
I mean >!mari was already dead!<
>! Or was she? !<
Yes. Their personalities are so complementary, Mari should hang out with her more often.

why is mari holding a banana
>!still can't belive Mari's neck just fucking snapped when she fell down the stairs!<
was literally just horrible luck
>!That's what happens when you respec all of your agility points into charisma!<
I’ve literally jumped off stairs myself and never happened to me
that's just how the human body works. some days it's resilient and you survive a plane crash, other days you slip in the shower and break your neck. completely up to chance
I’m gonna test this theory by breaking my neck. . I’ll reply in 5 minutes
it feels illegal that Mari wasnt included...  ;-;


She's >!an angel now!<
Look, Mr. B!
Look at all that delicious ADAM...
I can see the angels…
*jack/subject delta enters the fray!*
Bro I swear I just beat Bioshock 2 like two days ago. . (These protector trials are a bitch, tho)
She works at Disney land’s Pirates of the Caribbean ride.

Can u do mari as a pizza delivery driver
Eyo the pizza here
NOOOO
Where Mari?
>!don’t worry, she’s just getting pizza for the gang :)!<
ouja board
this just in, Mari is now the new world champ.
Mari, an angel(cookies)
Mari: 
>!where's something (aka Mari)!<
mari - dead
And mari? Still swaying in the wind
Where is Mari
meanwhile, mari in the corner: I'M FUCKING DEAD!
This is way better than Omari

Oh hey, Mari's there.
Omario
How could Mario do this? He knows his brother has terminal 7!
He was convinced the pasta was actually Mario’s… well let’s just say he didn’t enjoy what toad really was.
"I don't know what that means, but it's bad."
Number 7
>!Does that make Mr. L something?!<
Luigi died in zanzibar
Big Luigi and Outer Heaven were destroyed in Zanzibar Land!  How could he still be alive?
Shit i said that im gonna delete my comment now
>!Luigi was yeeted off the stairs, Toad hid the manslaughter, and Mario became a shut-in.!<
>!Daisy tried to hide the pain but it was nearly impossible. She stayed strong as much as she could for the rest of them but she was broken inside after losing Luigi!<
>!So basically Mario is Sunny, Peach is Aubrey and Daisy is Hero, then who is hamburgers on my mind guy?!<

that’s how he got into smash

I'm curious about mario black space now
That's just Count Bleck's castle
Obviously if it wasn’t then why can I find Mimi there?
Super Paper Mario was such a good game
Shame it’s so underrated
That remembered me when I played Super Paper Mario with an European copy because I didn't knew English at the time, but the European copy made the the whole game black and white for some reason so I had to play like that through the whole game.
Mari-O
Hello mari but dead i am mari but dream
This is what you see after that one video with Mario and Luigi arguing with each other.
Omario
I made an Omario edit and now i see this-
That that Happen in Mario game? When yes, which one?
In Super Paper Mario (Wii, 2007), you go to this world called the Sammer's Kingdom to claim a pure heart, but the world is on the verge of complete annihilation by the void that has been looming in the sky throughout the adventure. . . Before you can get the pure heart, the void destroys the Sammer's Kingdom and erases all its inhabitants from existence. When you return to the world after the void destroys it, all that's left is this utterly empty white landscape, with only some sparse, colourless pieces of Sammer's Kingdom being the only remnants. The game forces you to explore this world of nothing for quite a while, with almost nothing to see for the bulk of it, accompanied by one of the most unsettling pieces of music in any Nintendo game.. . Super Paper Mario is definitely an underrated gem in the Wii's lineup of games. Controversial gameplay aside, this game really showcased the unrestrained pinnacle of creativity in terms of story and writing, with the game being witty and hilarious yet not afraid to delve into darker themes on a whim. I personally feel that it has been a source of inspiration for many indie games we've seen in recent years.
OH MY GOODNES THANK YOU 😍🙏🙏🙏 I Donuts own it but I will propably watch full letsplays of ist in englisch and german if the are and Story Text changes👍
Super Paper Omario’s Mental. #BREAKDOWN BREAKDOWN
aw hell nah paper mario bouta face a manifestation of his depression and inner regrets
mari(o)
fun fact: this is an actual place in super paper mario
DUDE WTF I WAS JUST WATCHING A PAPER MARIO PLAYTHROUGH FOR NOSTALGIA
MARIo
>!Its okay guys Mari learned the Spin!<
Easy. Clones. *Mari Clones.*. . "Two hundred thousand units are ready, with another million well on the way."
Nurse joy is mari confirmed!!!😱 . . Sorry its kinda long TwT. . Theory #1. >!I like this theory alot because if I remember correctly after you finish the spider place mari will be very happy to see you again even though you saw her 5 minutes ago which probably means every mari have different mind but share the same memory with Mari or shes just that estatic about seeing you again , if you talk to the mari near the shark casino she will say she met alot of new people which probably means she's been there for the start!<. .  Theory #2. >!they share the same brain or something like every maris in the game was already on a picnic from the start and they share the same brain so thats why they share the same memory, experience and stuff!<. . Theory #3. >!omori doesn't want to see mari not in a picnic because sunny said picnic is a safe place and omori wants mari to be safe and omori always want to see mari always so omori put maris every where so he can see her!<
Or, y’know, dream logic
Woah, I can’t believe Mari turns into shrek when she’s off screen. That’s so cool!
Mari in her natural habitat
XD
I don’t remember honestly how i got to this theory but I remember it was nearly 100% right. I will try to remember and edit this comment in case. . >!However, mari doesn’t run like naruto, neither she teleports like an abra. Maris at picnics are just clones because omori doesn’t want to let her die and locks every mari in a picnic.!<. >!Edit: after humphrey!<
>!Locks every mari in a picnic damm omori!<
Damn I went from laughing my ass off to going 00
Unironically figured out half the plot when this Mari chick kept teleporting between picnics in the first couple hours
Nah, here is what happened.(warning it is kind of spoilery) Mari and Basil like omori are practically the rulers of the dream world. Basil takes up >![blackspace]!<, Mari rules headspace, and Omori rules white space. Since Mari is ruler of headspace she teleports whenever she likes.
For spoiler tags it's with \>! [Text] \!<
Oh! Thanks >![TEXT]!<
I realise I may have been a little off with what I meant, the brackets aren't needed. It's just to represent anything between the \>! \!<. . Also Happy Cake Day
Oh okay, also thanks!
Add that to the list of things I need to make a fic about-
Your welcome lol
BIG Paper Mario vibes on the back. Makes sense! I could definitely see this being official
I felt the paper mario vibes when making it, but like you said it makes sense!
Funny fact: one time on c.ai, the bot started calling Mari “Mario” and I didn’t even notice until I started paying attention😭
lol
Lmao
BuT jObBy!!!  🤓 🤓 🤓 🤓. . . . SoNiC tHe HeDgEhOg DiDn'T eVeN eXiSt WhEn SuNnY wAs BoRn, AnD mArIo WaS sTiLl CaLlEd JuMpMaN wHeN mArI WaS bOrN!! REEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!. . Edit: on an unrelated note oh look the Oneshot dev made this
Mario was first called Mario in 1982 when Donkey Kong Jr. came out. Sonic in 1991. Considering the game is implied to take place between the late 90s and early 2000s, the former is wrong while the latter is right
If the game takes place in 1996, then yeah Mari being named after Mario wouldn't make sense, but 1997+ then it would
HOLY FUCK, ITS \[transformers G1’er\] FROM JOBBYTHEHONG?!?!. . 
Bro you said the exact same thing and had that exact same chainsaw man reaction image when my Omori plushie showed up in that post I made about who would win if your figures were to fight each other. . 
Oh scrap, you’re that guy! I forgot about that post…. . . . (I’ll use a Nayuta one for this comment)
Is that HobbyTheJong 😳😳😳

mari flair detected   . . . invalid fact and will now push you down the stairs
pls no . . edit: the mari in my flair is >!already dead!<, you can't >!push me down the stairs!<
i can do it again 
 no pls
\*does a minuscule amount of tomfoolery\*
Ow, my ears burn
Mari is more of the >!open neck !<type
Depression intensifies. . Marina: “Why am I always surrounded by depressed waifus!?”
Isn’t she molly, marina is the pink one I thought
>!what Mari dying does to a mfer!<

\*Laughs in >!ghost Mari!< enthusiast\*
Hero wouldn't miss Mari,he would call her every hour or go with Mari
No it's called mario
Mari is the SOMETHING player
“Sure I guess”
“Have fun.”. . “EHEM! SO UH, SESSION OVER, BECAUSE PLANS NEED TO BE MADE. SO UH BYE.”
welcome to colorful space. . you've clapping for Mari for as long as you can remember
Maybe it's just me ,butThat sounds a bit wrong
It isn’t just you
If Mari hurt her knee doing gymnastics training rather than softball
I like the idea that Mari’s leg immediately snaps after making the perfect landing for a completely unrelated reason
She slips on the broken violin pieces at the bottom
The bone rolled a Nat 1
bone breaks and now you have slowness 2
Cripple mari au
Better than dead
Make it everyone make it now now
Omori but Mari is too stylish to die.
This has a price, now Mari will have her bad knee even more damaged that she may have to use a walking stick for the rest of her life.
well at least is better than being ded
you are right
Mari ultra instinct. . Bottom text
Honestly had to make my peace with this game by telling myself that Mari is still alive and well and nothing happens, because it hurt too much.. . Now I have a visual of this headcanon so thank you.
sick tricks mari
Looks like mari passed the vibe check
qte for mari to not die
I just noticed that mari got a nat 20 in acrobatics. I guess in-game she got a nat 1
I don't think that guy has stopped to unpack any of his emotions in four years. Even when you talk to him  at Mari's grave he doesn't talk about himself at all and brushes off any concerns Sunny might have. He's trying to remain positive in the wake of Mari's death I think but it really worries me when he pretends everything is fine even when he has all right to freak out.. . Sorry for the late reply, I don't check my notifs often
no problem, I just misunderstood and thought you meant he was "fucked up" as in he was a terrible person. This makes a lot more sense, lol.
Oh jeez, I had know idea my comment could be interpreted that way. I'm glad we could clear up that misunderstanding lol
Plus he also sees MARI as purple in Headspace, and if their Headspace colours were based off actual skin tones, MARI would be black and white like OMORI is
Steps to becoming mari.. Step 1. Step 2. Step 4. Step 7 . Step 18
You have achieved comedy
Omfg I genuinely bursted out when I got it. Deserves more likes
genius
I love it,good job! It's so cute
The flying picnic mat with Mari
I see you Questionable jello
I love the food
Delightful!
Wings for Mari
I love the amount of detail in the props <3 I also really like the prop design. The colors in this art lovely, as are the highlights and shading. Simple, but really fits well together <3 great job!
I love this 😭😭
This is great! I really enjoy the colors!
u/asuuree carrying the entire omori fanbase
Would smash 10/10
She dead bruh
I meant smash her down the stairs you psycho!
Even though she would be around 19 if she were alive, her dream world incarnation is perpetually aged 15. Maybe don't smash
is there something i'm missing where were the ages confirmed
At the time of Mari's death / perpetual ages of the Headspace friends:. . • Omori: 12. . • Mari: 15. . • Aubrey: 12. . • Kel: 12. . • Hero: 15. . • Basil: 12. . Current day / ages of the Faraway friends:. . • Sunny: 16. . • Mari: (would be) 19. . • Aubrey: 16. . • Kel: 16. . • Hero: 19. . • Basil: 16. . There are various sources on this info, including Headspace Hero claiming he's 15 and Sunny / Basil turning 12 in the photo album (which takes place 4 years before the events of the game)
oh thanks, guess i didn't pay enough attention lol
I love your use of colors!!
I love you both
incredible, man. i love the color scheme of the game so much
Mari, goddess of foods.
So you have an insta I could follow? I love the art
[here!]()
Thx
Ah yes, some lovely space tube food.
That picnic blanket was so small that she had to shove everything to one side
This animation is like something you'd find in-game. Amazing work!. . By the way, why is Mari so emotionless?
In this au Mari=Omori
Omari AU ?
Yes
Thank you!   . Regarding the question - like a person said it's AU >!where Mari and Sunny's fates are swapped resulting in different turn of events (as divergence there is also Hero being the witness instead of Basil).!< So it's not Mari, but Hiki – Mari’s alter-ego that plays similar role as Omori for Sunny.
Omari au fuels me 
Ah, I see. Very interesting, and thanks for the in-depth explanation.
oh! that's a depressing but interesting au
People are making a game about it
 . . 
Huh. I didn't know OMORI outfit was supposed to be Mari's piano. . . The more you know.
Same, but it makes sm sense considering omori was the name of the piano brand
Makes sense >!cuz OMORI character is based on the MARI's piano, so OMARI is based on SUNNY's violin !<>! !<
How did I never think of that?! Now that you say it it's so obvious!
Mari with black nail polish tho 👀. . . G O T H   M A R I
Heh… I wondered who would point it out. In my concept those black nails of Hiki exaggeratedly represent nail dirt from digging – like reminder of Mari’s sin. Hiki has this kind of an undertaker image in my head.
Yooo that's actually really cool! I love small details like that, that have a lot of thought behind it. Definitely part of the reason I love Omori so much :))
I primarily just used "Rough pencil" tool (in CSP) and drew it by hand. For hair f. e. I drew outline then used magic wand to make selection and then scribbled it out – it is kinda hard and tiring ngl, but in the end, it looks like this. Then I used "Running color spray" to make it look more grayish (in case of Hiki)
I don't get why people don't say Hikkiko when referring to Omari AU, it just rolls off the tongue a bit better imo
idk why but i love omari's fingernails
i'm sorry but this mari just look like omori with a wig on
Wow, i love the animations of the omari au SO MUCHHHH, are you working/helping with the mod for this au team? i would like to know 
No, I'm not sadly. I was thinking about joining the project somehow, but in the end, I think I have too much of "in depth" idea with my version of Omari AU that it would be hard to even work with other people concept that I'm sure is more or less made-up. And also, I’m kind of a realist and tbh don’t have much faith in such big fan-projects looking back on other ones like a lot of Undertale fan-games and even “Hikki AU” one that have been discontinued. Even so I wish they will stay ambitious and will reach their goals – thus making me change my view.
What if… I ship Mari with herself?
Well, you’re technically staying within the pile, so I guess it’s ok?

That is the face of someone who would definitely be shipped with herself
what if i ship mari with me..? 😳
You’re a Mari flair, so I’ll allow it. But just know. You’re on thin ice.
o-ok 
. . Be good.
Mari isn't sweetheart
Or Mari with something 

I’m not gonna lie I actually saw hector x mari on Reddit a few days back
Excuse me, what in the hell-fried fuck?
Dude that was my reaction when I saw it
It was,,,,,
i love how there's only the 5 bc the single mari emote is unusable in this context
i think if there’s one think the entire subreddit can agree on it’s that mari needs another emote…
Should be the one at the door on day one
It's worth noting that Opposite Day lured in a lot of people by not revealing the Mari/Sunny stuff until near the end. For most of it, it was just a mystery of why Mari committed oyasumi.
I know, but it’s still fucking awful what it turned out to be in the end.
Oh, absolutely. But I think it's false advertising was the reason it has so many views and kudos. Of I could go back and remove the kudos I gave in the first few chapters, I absolutely would, but ao3 does not allow that.
What makes this worse is that they follow up that fic with a massive Mari/Sunny fic. She has gone off the deep end, and is beyond saving now. >!Watching her get owned in the comment section of the last part of Hands is still incredibly satisfying to look back on.!<
I just remembered now... "Mari" with socks...
I don’t know what you mean by that, nor do I want to. 
You don't want to
What is that
what the fuck
please explain im begging you
No
I require EXPLANATION.
And I require sanity after the shit I saw
?
  NO THERE ISN'T YOU...YOU... YOU KILLED MARI SO YOU DONT GET TO TALK
: YEAH, WELL, ORANGE JOE TASTES LIKE SHIT!
. NO IT DOESN'T IT TASTES LIKE MOCHA FRAPPE FROM MCDONALD'S WITH A HINT OF ORANGE
: IT TASTES LIKE PIG SHIT AND EXPIRED LEMONS, YOU FUCKING NUMBSKULL!

>! Hero x Mari's corpse x Mari's ghost x Something Foursome !<
AHHHHHH I'M DYING FROM AOIJAIOPAOAAPAJAPQJP0AAJ9A0J
What are you even talking about 
A new smutty fanfiction idea that just popped into my head. >! Only thing I haven't figured out yet is who should walk in on Hero doing the deed at the end. Should it be Basil so that he's repeating his trauma of a friend doing something fucked to Mari, or should it be Kel to make it cannon? !<
Wait, I thought we were joking, what the hell

Unrelated and I hate to be "that guy" but it sorta annoys me how most fanmade real world Mari sprites seem to forget how Mari would've had purple hair
Yeah, I can see that. I guess it depends on the context of the situation that she’s still alive.
Oh because Hero and Mari would be adults. (If mari was still alive that is)
Well, yeah, they were the same age when Mari died. Also, since Hero is 19 during the events of the game, and the rest of the gang is 16, shipping them with each other is a big red flag. If you have to start making excuses for why a ship is legal, then you’re already sending off some bad vibes right there.
Exactly what I am getting at there, thank you!
F*** it, im mixing them all.. . ((Sunny x Kel) +/x  <—(fraction) (Basil x Aubrey) +/x (Hero x Mari + (Mari x Something))) x (Humphrey x Air Conditioning) = infinite Depression. . C R Y A B O U T I T
get this to top so we can make people suffer
You're just asking to get mad lol, don't blame me if you do. . . Of choice would be Sunny x Mari but I also like Aubrey x Mari and Hero x Kel.
…yeah, I regret asking. But I still recommend you stay away from OmegaFallon’s works even if you ship Mari x Sunny, as they literally wrote their super long incest fic right after a super long fic >!where Mari sexually abused Sunny!<. Whether or not you agree with incest, you gotta admit that’s pretty fucked up.
Yeah I'm very much not into >!sexual abuse.!< Thanks for the heads up!
You’re welcome! Also, stay away from HEROMARI. Everything she writes is shit that could make a fully devoted Christian question god’s existence.
how about y/n x Mari? I feel that it could be some of the most wholesome fanfics ever.. . please don't make a stairs joke.
What do you mean by y/n, exactly?
your name. Basically a self-insert
Oh.

I have left comments on both oneshots. Batshit insane as always, Abyss.
I refresh new on OMORI AO3 at least 8 times a day. I’ve found a decent amount of fanfics in the past couple of days that have really piqued my interest. I’ll definitely check out your oneshots, though.

you really like mari

Suuuuuure 😉
Twitter users don't sexualize 15 year old girls >!(and no, just because she'd be 19 if she was alive does not count)!< for a minute challenge
Jeez,why you keep think that I’m gonna do some bad stuff with bad thought men ? I really have no intend to lewd or do anything,sorry if I say Hot Mari is wrong those.
Don't mind people like that, Twitter cancel cucks got bored of nothing happening on twitter right now and are going to fandoms they like to see if they can try to label randos as pedos
I loathe twitter with every single fucking cell in my body, people that think "cancelling" has a place in 2021 are out of their mind. It's just insanely creepy when people start calling a 15 year old hot. It's pretty alarming when I'm getting downvoted for wanting people not to sexualize minors, which is like basic human fuckin' decency??
OP didn't call Mari "hot", just "good looking" and EVEN THEN their english is butched due to it not being their first language, they were just looking to say that they think a character looks good/cute to them and you can see it everywhere in the comment section. . You're the one closer to sexualising minors more than anything for your first thought being "that guy is sexualising a minor" before trying to get anything straight, for someone that thinks "canceling" doesn't have a place in our time, you certainly HAVE the mindset
Ok if it isn't their first language I'll cut them some slack. [But are you willfully ignoring this??]() And [this]()? This comment section is creepy as hell with shit like [this](), too!
Again, what OP said sounds weird but i don't see any ill intent. . And the other 2 are totaly creepy, they 100% seem to be speaking english and especialy the second guy. . I'm not ignoring anything, you just need to stop applying cancel culture to your life if you hate it so much. . Edit: Especialy since the guy claims to be 17 so sheesh what a young "pedo"
Look, Reddit doesn't exactly have the bar set very high so my expectations are kind of in the fucking mantle every single time someone posts a woman and comments on her appearance. All in all, I don't think there's any ill intent from OP, he's just being a little weird
What if they simply said “they look cute”?
That'd be different
All in all i think you need to chill because your reaction is a twitter reaction because if you'd have waited a lil you'd have realised there was no ill intent from the very begining. . Attacking people out of the blue is not a very good thing to do
Yeah that makes sense. Sorry man, it's just that a lot of other comment sections and posts on this sub get really thirsty so everything feels like some weird fuckin' pedo thing
I say it's better to ignore it, man. . People will be weirdos and calling them out on it won't do much. . Best you can do is downvote and be glad that atleast they're not creeping on real children
I want her to hug me and tell me everything will be ok
“Everyone all want to have a hug”
BRO I MISSREAD IT AS "I want her to hang me and tell me everything will be ok" LMAO
I love how she looks so soft
STOP IT it's no pedophile shit inclueded here , we just fame a good fan art . . Yes it's looks a bit sexualized but you should question artist about it
Imo it's not really sexualized. Canonically mari was flat, but i guess breasts are just a part of the female human anatomy that women tend to have (shrug)
😮
Am i wrong?
um what is flat
What’s cooking, good looking?
“Yeah.”
please do not the mari
Me when I the Mari: 🙂->🔥->☠
NO DON'T DO IT
What ? No pls don’t think like that.
bro you captioned it “very good looking big sis” 😭
That’s because she beautiful but I wrote the title differently just make it a bit attractive you know.
**Yeet the Mari.**
Wat ? :v
Not gonna lie, I can get her tastes. Dedicated academic who can make you kickass meals?
I have a question.... . &#x200B;. . when will people stop trying to defend a fictional character and start defending actual children?
Salty, much?
just annoyed at the fact people are defending fictional children with their lives while basically ignoring things such as 'Cuties' from netflix
Ah, makes sense, however, there ARE people who defend fictional children and real life children, like, look up cuties on YouTube, you will see more hate then support
But from what I know, not all lolicons/shotacons are going on their way to abuse children, just like not all CS:GO players are going on their way to commit terrorism.. . &#x200B;. . I can safely say this because I have a friend on discord which was attracted to lolicon but would never think about doing anything wrong with a actual child, and because I played a lot of Halo and some Mortal Combat II when I was a kid but I would never think about actually glory killing that one annoying kid at the restaurant. . . &#x200B;. . Off course there are bad apples on lolicon/shotacon, there is always bad apples on any group of people, but intentionally cherry picking Lolicon/Shotacon fandoms because of that one guy who did this atrocity is not a fair way to judge an entire group of people, btw, keeping these types of thoughts and acts in the realm of fiction is better than practicing them in real life, right?
Exactly what I thought.
So, you can't see the difference between reality and fiction.. . Or you actually see the point I was trying to make.
I do see the point of what I’m trying to make, I’m just not good at expressing it
Ok then, how about this, you are allowed to dislike a kink, but you aren't allowed to police other people's kinks, that's the police job.
Fair
Remember, necrophilia is bad.
I don't like this pose,i REALLY don't like this pose
oh no the horni is coming
Good looking......?. #. I know that art is pretty messy with all this NSFW stuff , but art is art yes?. #. Yet Artist have some issues to do ****this**** peace of moder fan-fiction
Still but it’s not ok if the fan gone wrong.. . My bad if this title didn’t see to be friendly.
I love this. Also ngl, this game made me wish I had a sibling like Mari because I loved her as a character and felt so bad for Sunny with what happend to her.
Keep up the great work... She looks adorable! :D
Hero, GET THAT MARI BOOTY ALREADY-
“Hide it”
Ok, I was looking through my post history and came across this whole fiasco again.. . &#x200B;. . Dude, there is no way you can "bad English" your way out of this.
Can… can you **actually** stop with harassing this individual in every comment they make? They like a fictional character, and you find it creepy. Congratulations 😁 Now, ignore it the next time you see it if you are still a part of the subreddit (:
yeah, it's creepy, cuz shes a kid, i don't ee your problem here, you
r/ihadastroke
I mean my “bad English” is like how I don’t understand the true meaning of my title those,sorry for the title seem less innocent.
You didn't mention the fact that you supplied a punchline to a joke about a 15 year olds butt... ni
Well I won’t make that title again,just try to be creative.
This is so cute!!
Hot
I got cursed for every artist I know that days bro 
I'm horny now :(
🤨📸
Very, VERY EPIC art

GREAT GAME, CREEPY AS HELL FANDOM, SHES A CHILD!!!. . I Love this game, and you do too. But, come on!. . >!oh and shes dead!<
i mean it is just regular fanart. (unless theres more god help us)
"Very good looking"
The OP doesn't have english as their first language so I'd cut them some slack on the modern inneuendo on calling someone "Very good looking"
yeah that is wierd actually, idk why youre getting downvoted. . . . EDIT:aaaaand got downvoted, seriously this is just wierd
go to convertisal posts of all time in this subreddit youll see this guy
well, simple, creeps,
There is more. . . . There is much more.
Like Omori R34. . Theres literally 300 or something of it and it makes me wanna cry
I thought there was 500 of it
Honestly if theres more I don't even doubt it, people are weird
True. And creepy
Twitter users don't sexualize 15 year old girls >!(and no, just because she'd be 19 if she was alive does not count)!< for a minute challenge. Seriously why are you getting downvoted for not liking "**Very good looking** Big Sis" this sub creeps me out sometimes
EXACTLY THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST
I'm getting downvoted too. Getting downvoted for telling reddit users not to sexualize minors gang
Yeah if it was just "beautiful Mari" or something that'd be fine
So the title just feel wrong ?
The Words "Good looking" and further "Very good looking" are often associated with "catcalling" or being flirty. . . and as you know trying to flirt with a 15 year old is a big nono in a lot of people's minds. . I know this wasn't your intention but I wanted to explain it
Ok thanks for the explaining
It literally calls her "very good looking" in the post title and the comments section is full of thirst. This argument is requires you have to not read *a lot* in order to think this.
Very good looking and beautiful essentially mean the same thing, but with a slightly different feel. I know you didn't mean for it in a bad way though.
I just try to be creative with my title those,but I don’t expected to get overreact with that then call me a pedo for real.I’m sorry for that title.. . But I wonder Mari had flirted with Hero this line:”What cooking,good looking.” Then why “very good looking” make you guy feel weird or aware of the title ?
If you look at your example, good looking is often used in a more flirty way. I think that is why it feels different than "beautiful". . . I'm sorry people think you're a pedo for real, that's some crazy shit
No joke,just because the title be difference and then some guy just poll a pedo card on me and I be like:”Yo what,did my title just make you think of me like a pedo for real ?”
I don't think that you're a pedo, it's just a weird thing to say.
Well if it mean like that then you can try to imagine Hero say that just to make the titile functional those.. . I just try to make some difference with Beautiful Mari title. (cause I see it pretty boring)
But she doesn't look 15 here? Aging up characters is still bad?
Also I don't get why you're being downvoted
they upset the pedos lol
Smh, when will people learn that pedos have feelings too??? /s
**Pls I Repeat that I just write the title a bit different so pls don’t let you mind get weird**
Dude, the guy said "Verry "Good-loking" Shes 15. Its not the photo, the title.
I feel weird when you just upset the title,Honestly. I understand you don’t want to see some creep,but the creep is only there own ideal just want to do some bad thing of there mind those.. . But I’m not them,people see the title pretty normal but you feel aware of the title.
I wasn't referring to the post, that if the op keeps acting, or even phrasing stuff  like this, it could end bad
Hey i just wanna see some weird joke or nice comment but I’m not expected to be call a pedo just for the title.. . Why I just the phrase of Word for a bit and then someone make a conclusion that I’m a pedo like for real ?
You're getting downvoted because you're overreacting over someone who's english isn't their first language trying to compliment a character they find cute or beautiful. . Aren't YOU the one making all of this sexual by implying it in the first place??
you just said it yourself, they find her cute or beautiful, she is 15. . . That should speak for itself.
Damn. . I didn't know calling a baby cute was trying to sexualise or romanticise the baby. . Same goes for children/teen, a compliment doesn't equal to sexualisation/flirting. . Get a grip, if what you said made sense there would be alot of people going to jail for calling young people cute. . Edit: Didn't you say you were leaving btw?
your still calling a kid.. :very.. good looking." That's not.. cute.
Read the title
And as many said before: It's clearly not the intention to sexualise her. . It's still a compliment. It's odd, i agree but OP is not an english speaker so they didn't know that sounded wrong. . Again i'll ask:. . "Aren't YOU the one making all of this sexual by implying it in the first place??". . Go back accusing everyone to be pedos on twitter, this is reddit
Wait what,I’m sorry if this make you feel wrong but why you just insult me for the title.
Sorry, I was pissed off, i'll fex that.
there
No,I’m not gonna do some weird stuff or anything,just write the title a bit different so pls not.
>!It’s Mari’s!<
welcome to the time where making a joke is the worst thing you can do. . &#x200B;. . the worst part is that this isn't even twitter
i mean it's understandable, the joke is kinda nsfw so all fault is mine :v
nah, I would say the joke was good tbh, there was no need to delete it, sorry if I sent the wrong message
no worries i get what you mean, tysm for the opinion
oh, alright, btw don't let other people control what you post on the internet (unless if it's something illegal or deeply imoral), you might get downvoted to hell but you still got your rights to speak
Wow very se-. Please.. This is a child. Reddit please
she is canonically 19 in real world sooooo.... *oh no the horni is coming*
**Excuse me no,Stop**. . . “go to Horny jail pls”
delete
Take your negativity elsewhere

Awe I love ghost Mari'a hair flowing over the whole group on the last panel. :D
Mari would be proud.
Just because you were fine watching it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve an M rating. Black Space, Black Space 2, the Truth and, conversely, how blunt it's presented >!with Mari's hanging body as an enemy in both routes!< and its blunt portrayal of suicide in Headspace >!but also in multiple endings!< isn't suited for most younger teenagers. You could make an argument that 16+ is more suitable than an M raiting, but we don't really have that.. . Y'all aren't babies, I know that. I was consuming horror content myself as a teenager. But not every teenager can handle that. My little sister couldn't and she's only a year and a half younger than me. She still can't usually handle horror even as an adult. And honestly a lot of the end game content like Black Space, Black Space 2, and the Truth section are distressing even as an adult. Let alone a younger teenager whom might not be prepared/able to handle that type of content.
actually if there was a 16+ rating that would probably fit more
I agree there. If 16+ existed it would be a more suitable rating than M.
im normally really sensitive to horror games but this one was mostly fine
exactly i mean even mario rpgs like paper mario can get dark a times . . for an example this is an [soundtrack]()  from super paper mario
The fact that Super Paper Mario had the monster truck sized balls to >! end an entire world while you were still in it, leaving nothing but a silent, white void!< still gets me to this day. I miss when Paper Mario had that sort of crazy shit instead of the milquetoast stuff we have now.

but he's missing his eye. so it's not that ending. right? or am I miss remembering something
Don't worry it's just a window behind them
Great/sad art. On a more serious note. . >!Is the Mari during the dream sequence actually her soul/spirit that tries to help Sunny move on/Tell him she forgives him or is it just a figment of his own imagination finding ways to cope? Hell it is probably just me coping,wanting to hope/get some closure that Mari is allright and forgives him.!<
Might as well be. There are slight hints to the supra natural in omori. They're placed well enough to not interfere too much with the main plot. For example, the cowboy guy sort of hints at the idea of a nexus of dream worlds
Yeah maybe. It is fairly ambigious. Like the whole dreamscape/whatever is obvs way to...weird to be totaly realistic so its hard to say how much is just meant to be fantasy/manifastion of emotiosn and what could be supernatural.. . Due to how it is presented and how it is uniqe to everything else in whitespace/dreamworld i am inclinded to belive it is sora real.. . Despite all the stuff in Omoro i feel the game is ultimatley "somewhat optimistic" and not needlessly cruel if you choose the good ending so who knows
"Hell it is probably just me coping,wanting to hope/get some closure that Mari is allright and forgives him.". . \^. . ~~I just want wholesome ghost Mari and Sunny moments OMOCAT, make it canon~~
Oh god, the feels qwq. . But amazing art
this is during the GOOD ending and nobody can tell me otherwise
Idk how that would be possible but i wish.
Idk bro, that backround is saying something different
Could be a dream. We don’t know that! Could just be crying about Mari outside of the hospital, it doesn’t imply anything TOO dangerous!
The fact that he’s holding onto her tells me that he knows she is there and can feel/see her! <333. . I choose to believe that she came back… I don’t care how. I just do… I can’t cope any other way…
Not the good+ ending? You scumbag!

why is mari boiling
***It’s Mari spirit***
thats irrelevent                                               . the question still stands                              . tell me why mari is boiling
What do you mean ? I still not understand yet.
 take a good long look at this i circled the boiling bubbles
Wait I can’t access to the link.
why not
It just say: Access Denial. . So I don’t see anything.
hold on a second
Sorry for misunderstanding the question.
In my head I read this with the voice of Mimir from God of War. Then I click on the picture and now I feel stupid. 
Only if Mari survived i would been much better.
Why must you hurt me this way
Mari, you have no idea- 
I thought it was mari-
*Don't worry because at first, I thought so too--*
I feel like she looks like mari
>!at first i thought it was mari standing next to basil and i was just freaking out about mari and everything then i realized it was just the aid !<  to be honest i really like this head canon my head canon is the sunny x aubrey ship and i having thought far ahead
Oh shit I thought that Polly was Mari for a sec and got confused
Let me guess. "Do You Want To Have A Picnic With Mari?"
Yes, that one. And it’s WIP sequel
>!mari doesn’t care if she’s dead or not, if she can interact with physical things (like the piano-) she sure as hell can lift a boy that probably weighs 2 pounds!<

>! Mari is there !<
Are you trying to make a point or a TBOI reference (Mari plays the binding of Isaac confirmed). . Because if it's the latter just tell him to give me the controller so I can get the completion marks for him
sure
Or keyboard idk
Ngl it doesn't seem like a good idea to play Omori after something likr that happened, what with the whole point being >!that Mari didn't commit suicide!< , but idk maybe it works out.
Ohh, I dig that style! Please do share on here, if you end up pursuing it further . . And anytime!! I've always been a "wannabe artist," so to speak-- so I know all too well how harsh the self-criticism can get. And while I hate to say it... >!just look how the path of perfectionism ended up for Mari!< 
Yes, he keeps it bottled up, but he still isn't leaving the house on his own, is he? If Sunny used to go outside before Mari's passing, and doesn't go outside like he did before, post-Mari's passing, what other conclusion could you draw other than mental illness?. . Unironically yes? It sucks if a house gets broken into but in the case of a break-in, I would much rather have my child with me and lose some material possessions instead of shot dead by a robber. Or, you know. Potentially offing himself like my daughter supposedly did.
The problem with this is its up to interpretation, we haven't seen her so we don't know her entire personality. She could've been avoiding him purposely or not, we don't know. We know her husband left and Mari died and took a toll on everyone.. . The issue arrives with the moving, why would she pick up Sunny for moving if she was avoiding him?. . Also it was never confirmed she left him around the break since Maris death, at least in some way. I dunno why a kid could even keep a house and pay the bills
For a second i trought "How tf Mari is not dead"
so mari is a street racer now, yes?. . meet me on hakone on sunday, at 1am.
*C-121 drift intensifies*
well that's usui, not hakone.
Which makes me wonder. What car will you think she drives in that case?
either an S14 kouki or a lightly modified S15.
We never got to meet grown up Mari, yet I miss her every single day :(
Mari at the school: get on the car we gonna go to mf dairy queen
Why do I feel like Mari could have been like this if she wasn't a perfectionist?
I feel like even though Mari valued perfectionism she valued her brother more and I feel like she would've done this regardless lol
Imagine her drop kicking down his classroom door and saying "c'mon we're going to fuck up dairy queen."
TRUE
Seeing mari Curse is Extremely out of character.   .  She's the type to rat out someone for cursing while saying "Sorry😌".
I hope people make of those mari brother complex
Little did Mari know she wasn't going to survive that day
Mari is a good sibling.
mari has a drivers license?
it only takes 1 car accident to create OMORI or Omari.
I have Kel/Mari’s personality (who knows how that works) Basil’s interests, extreme trauma, and Aubrey’s mommy and daddy issues . . I also fell backwards >! down some stairs (and many other stair related injuries) as a child so I relate with Mari on that one!<
I did the opposite of what mari did many times by falling up the stairs more than falling down em
OMG BOT ENS BACK I MISSED YOU ( with a spoiler tag too)
Bro the amount of times I tripped going upstairs in my 20 years of living is insane  I’m surprised all of my toes are still intact lmao
Yep and I still do it from time to time
We’re just built different 
I got pushed down the stairs TWICE. I was trying to got for Mari moment any%
If you replace >!mari dying!< with my childhood dying then yes omori is very relatable and he is probably the closest character to my exact life rn 
r/im14andthisisdeep
I find Mari relatable. . . By name.. . I'm terrified of stairs now.
I only relate to Mari bc of a (head)canon that she is EXTREMELY a perfectionist and tried so hard to be perfect and please her parents. That's why I love her so much, I see myself in her.
Haha I relate to Mari 😜 no one’s fault tho, i did it on my own
The flirting god, also known as Mari, would be "proud" of her.
"Aubrey bad, no redemption" thing is such as annoying thing because outside sure, but there's plenty of stuff scattered around the real world to explain why. (Spoilers naturally):. . >!Her going to church to repent for how she feels!<. . >!The way she blames basil for the defacing of the book that omori caused!<. . >!The stealing of the photos to cling onto what little she has left of mari!<. . >!The fact that most of her friends shrank away after mari died leaving her alone and bitter towards them!<. . That's just a few off the top of my head, there's likely more.
goofy reason? but weren't the photos not only pictures but also great memories with friend group where Mari and everyone else was alive,happy and togeder?????
Still, bullying someone for 4 years just for that is a bit long
I agree with you
Oh yeah, and that warrants nonstop bullying and physical violence for years /s
I'd like to add another one: . . "The gang saw >! Mari's hanging body !<". . This was literally never implied at any point in the game.
Idrk, I just haven't really heard of it and saw Merg played it, so I watched some videos, then watched a story summarized video. Then just kinda watched from the beginning, and I realized the game was pretty cool, and here I am after pre-ordering an omori plushie that isn't gonna be here for a few months.
Mari reincarnated as The Rock. Poggers!
Mom i hope you can sent us to Mari quickly... very quickly.
Mom, I want to see Mari
Don't worry there just going to visit Mari
Mari said "you're" as well so...
Mari: Though it would be quite the endevor Kel, it is still possible to construct sentences without the letter, while still using purple prose.. . Hero: That's great Mari... but endeavor is spelt with an ***A***.. . Mari: Shoot.
IT COULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT WITH MARI OH GOD
She wouldn’t fuck up the cobble generator now, would her?
That's right
From the third picture, I was reminded of a game from Roblox. I fell from the map's edge and the it said "*Just like Mari from OMORI.*"
item asylum i believe?
Yup you nailed it!
Idk but tell me
Yup it's "Item Asylum".
Ok thanks
>!"Mari loved him and you killed him"!<. . 
standing heeeeere I realiiiiiiiize
: Mari don’t
: Mari yes
: continue this and your gonna hanging around outside
 : OMORI please do not
:sHuT Up yoU DuMb aSS, i’Ll steal your liver if you tell me noT to do sOmEthing AgAiN
 : Can I please get to finish my presentation?
:is my sister dead
:I have returned to make fun of you
: god damn it, mari...
:>!Should I push her down the stairs again?!<
: >!do not shove her down the stairs!<
hey back to paying attent- : shut it this sh- :Language!
:(scoffs) like you could
 : NO PLEASE DON’T!
:you wanna go down flower boy?



:I’m back bitches
 : did we not say to leave, w o m a n ? !
It will be lively again once Rainy Mari drops its demo
We will get a surge of popularity when rainy mari comes out, but otherwise the game is still decently popular, I still recommend it to people.
like mari unfortunately</3
Your sister is Mari tier
I decided to do some research on >!hellmari!< at night. Worst decision of my life, for the longest of times I thought something was watching me from my door 
~~^(i am in lots of pain and anguish please god help me for the love of all that is holy i need this suffering to end i feel nothing but pain and misery from the trauma and abuse i have faced along with the constant ableism i deal with because of my disability fuck everything every waking minute of each and every day this nightmarish hell needs to cease please for the love of god just put me the fuck out of my misery and--)~~. . I AM TOTALLY FINE. TOTALLY NOTHING WRONG HERE. 
My two fanbases are combining. I don't know how to feel about this.
Omori get the watermellon
Water
It's not dream stans so it should be fine lmao
feel proud pal, this...thing...is funny as hell XD
I bet basil planted herbs for Mari
I wouldn't be surprised if Basil being a florist gave Mari some weed to calm her down in practice, hell that might even have prevented "the pizza incident" XD
my ears burn
So >!SOMETHING wasn't created by Sunny pushing Mari down the stairs, but it was created once she died from her addiction!<
That's actually a sick fanfic idea
It would be kind of funny for person to read this au, and be sad, then realize it was inspired but Mari smoking a fat blunt
yeah.
So basically its just a videogame adaptation of requiem for a dream?
RIP Mari, she died from injecting one to many marijuanas.
smoke weed everyday.
I think it’d be from how hard it is to smoke properly. If you don’t do it properly, your lungs are gonna hurt.
“Hey Omori! Check out this new item I found in the Junkyard!”
"OH NO Mari! You'll get Lung Cancer and die!"
I can't take it anymore
pls i'm SUS
Reminds me of a story about one of my parent's college friends, who got their name "Mary Warner" mispronounced as Marijuana by a sub teacher with a thick southern accent.
LOL
GOD.  . . . DAMN IT.
I made a fic about Mari getting high on AO3 awhile ago and this is awesome
LMAO.
I hate this, because everytime I see one of these blunt memes, I know that the pose comes from a fucking Mario render
I deadass just realized why it looks so familiar bruh
All I saw was "MARIjuana" in my notifications. This is about what I expected.
blursed
someone draw rasai and mari smoking togeter
the weed duo XD
Marijuana is legal in my country and id like you to know that.
Same here
Nice
ayo mari with the fat blunt 😳
im scared for my life
[Thank you for helping create this interaction with a friend]()
Cursed
I'd gladly smoke a fat one with her ngl
WHY
Ah hell no
Mari's smoking a fat blunt
Mari is >!Smoking a fat blunt! Just why!<
perfect
>! Omori au where Mari dies of a drug overdose and Sunny and Basil frame it as a suicide !<
that won't work for them, that's how I see it.
I LOL’D!!!!!
MARI STOP-
>!😡 ✋🪜!<
No.
i csnt
hey u/Moldea
she looks like if she was a character from the backyardigans
First Name Mari. Last Name Juana
Same with a meme I made long time ago on imgFlip.. . Also, Mari smoking a fat dart.
Mari goes down the stairs and dies.
OH GOD NO
oh no mari don't you'll get sick!!
Why- it was Ralsei, then Mari
goin hiiigh lil brotha
I swear this fandom will be the death of me.
Omori, but Mari suffers from addiction and dies from it,  I don't know but that sounds more depressing than the original plot.
Mari is high as f\*ck XD
Well this sub has gone downhill
doobie
it's the proud stance for me
hopefully she doesn't have to worry about lung cancer

Yeah, and it was fault of nintendo's stupid normatives, They same reason Paper Mario is "dying".
All I see is Mario & luigi green shell attack.
Kinda reminds me of the Mario and Luigi combo attacks from the rpg series
>! Mari wouldnt fall for that !<
r/allemotionsupvote
I made it real
I meant r/angryupvote, but I'm feeling all emotions from the comment
I think the bot’s saying you need emotional support lmao
Maybe
Hollow Knight pfp? Definitely needs emotional support (I love the game)

. . Live fish reaction:
AHSAJDKSAHDKJHASKDASKDJHAKSDJHAKSJDHKAJSDHKAJDSHKAJHD
I think she did
No, he was sent to Mari
He's Mari's brother, he's just too shy to use rizz 
Why is Mari also pulling?
mari wants sunny to go school
Yeah just swatting off a lil’ ol’ bug offa ya is all
While not this setting, I did see one where it's after the game, >!Mari's still dead,!< but a previously thought dead eldest brother finds his way back home, Mori. Didn't read it all but I do remember it existing, thing it's >!The Eldest Sibling.!<. . There's probably some others where Omori is actually a sibling or where Omori spills into the real world and becomes a sibling lol
Is there any way you can find it? It sounds interesting.
Thers you go. 
Author of the fic here, I hope you enjoy it :D. . Do note that the fic has a lot to do about the side characters, rather than the main cast. >!There is also a variant where Mari doesn't die either :D!<. . Either way, glad you decided to take interest in it
I thought that mari and omori were trying to pull him to school
Mari: OLD BAG WITCH?! OH NOW YOU'RE GETTING IT YOU MONOCHROME BRAT!
Omori : LET GO OF ME NOW OR YOU WILL GET PUSHED DOWN THE STAIRS DON'T TEST ME I WILL MAKE HIM DO IT FOR ME PIANO PLAYING WITCH!
The only thing missing is >!something!< or dream mari assisting :)
god something with a furrowed brow is just such a powerful image to me. . frustrated something
“MARI GET THIS LITTLE RABID BASTARD OFF OF ME”
Mari and Omori throw hands on the regular
AU where everything is the same except Mari just got a lil banged up from the fall and Sunny and Mari have an even younger brother named Omori
Mari in Japanese means Truth, their dad had a Bonsai tree, Omocat is half Asian, Oyasumi is Japanese for Goodnight, Hellmari is similar to an onryō, Mari and their mother took flower arrangement classes, and also, the type of flower language used in the game is specifically Hanakotoba, which is the Japanese language of flowers. Oh, and also, Sunny's flower, the white tulip, in the Japanese language of flowers means Forgiveness.. . Also, the white egret flowers are apparently native to areas around Japan.. . . . This link is where I found the meaning of the white egret without reference to the game (very hard with how popular Omori is). It also mentions Hanakotoba.. . . . This is the link I think Omocat used. Apparently my phone had to translate it from Japanese, so I think this is the best thing I got.
Mari’s headspace seifuku would be my guess for one reason
Wait, can someone explain why Mari and Snunny are asian pls! Im curious now
Yooo you captured her essence and vibe so well, and the fit is on point! . . If I can offer a suggestion, how about Mari next time?
Thanks ! Mari ? She was actually the cosplay I was supposed to do instead of Aubrey lmao x) I'll think about it, thank you !
Nice job! I’m surprised you managed to find her iconic clothes! Have you considered doing this again with another Omori character? My personal recommendation would be Mari, but it’s up to you!
Thank you so much ! And yeah, I was actually supposed to cosplay Mari befor her !❤❤ May I ask why you think I could cosplay as her though ? I'm curious🙈🙈❤❤
Np! . . Tbh Mari’s underrepresented in cosplay. Which is ironic considering the meaning of her character in-game lmao.
Thank you so much ! I'll maybe do Mari someday...🥰
I'm not sane. This game absolutely broke me because I relate to Mari in MANY ways... you can figure out the rest.
It's also that. My HC is that her turbulent life is a result of desperation given her life crumbled around her post-Mari, and deep down she's still like she was 4 years ago, and in my (ongoing forever because life reasons) fic that's exactly what is explored. Everyone coming clear about everything, doing it right, and being there for each other...but with some twists. . . Although should be said that in this one Mari is put in one of those very long comas instead of dying, and will eventually wake up. I dunno when, honestly, i have enough to deal with IRL and would need to get in touch with the material again, but she will. And thus the despair of our favourite group of friends finally ends...with some caveats.
Its literally not one sided he didn't project it as all of the inner selfs aren't fake versions they are literally just them but prior to mari's death I feel like people keep forgetting this
Just because they don't exist doesn't mean they aren't based on the real versions mate they are just themselves we literally see that proven in the photos why are you coping on it so hard the literal entire point is sunny/omori wanting to go back to how things were before mari death meaning they literally are just themselves before mari death they say this so many times in the story how did you miss it?
Mate i literally just explained to you the literal plot reason of why they fucking exist they are exactly how they were prior to mari's death and we literally see a flash back of the real life them seeing the act exactly the same I don't get how this is so hard for you to wrap your head around sunny wants to pretend mari's death didn't happen so he imagines them exactly how they were prior to mari's death there for no they aren't warped or idealized they are literally just them before mari passed and 4 years prior he knows them what they'd say how they'd act etc and hell we literally see this proven in the real world present how they still clearly have personality traits from that long ago hell hero literally says the exact same thing as his dream world version when helping kel and Aubrey and kel and Aubrey act the exact same as well in response mate this is how it was made on purpose the entire point and plot revolve around sunny's rejection of time passing after he killed mari it is sunny backtracking and pretending it never happened there for they all remain unchanged and act as they were prior to mari's death where the hell did you get the idea they were fake versions from
I got the “idea” that they were fake versions from the literal canon. They do not exist in that form anymore, and have not since prior to Mari’s death. Thus, any decision they make is not their own. This is easily understood with basic reading comprehension and literacy skills. Someone’s memories of a person are not the same thing as that person; they are a very filtered view of what that person chooses to present to the world and, in the case of the Headspace characters, are subject to inaccuracy thanks to their role as Sunny’s coping mechanism. This is one of the primary themes of the game. Also, please learn how to use punctuation. That run-on-sentence is a headache in visual form.
And that's just wrong in the story as I've literally fucking proven you can keep trying to find real life excuses for your denial but in this game the only idealization is that they never witness and had to go through mari's death proven and reiterated in. the. fucking. Game. You can stroke your dick to your ego as much as you want you missed the point of the game and you're indenial about that fact even though the game as I've said shows every god damn time that the real life versions parallel the versions in the dreamland because your so stubbornly wrong that they are merely idealized even though that makes no sense for the context of the story and completely disgrards the plethora of evidence to the contrary as well as the point of the dreamworld to begin with because if I had to guess to fucking speedran the game that's the only way you could miss the dart board this hard
I actually think it was more Sunny closing himself off from her that affected her more than Mari's death. Throughout the game we see in the photos of the original World the two of them seem to have had crushes on one another but Mari died Sunny started closing himself off and living in a fantasy world where Mari was still alive.
Down the drain with Mari
Mari: “Hello, I am in a plumbing system.”. . Sunny: “Huh.”
~~insert jumpscare~~
Or because >!Mari was gonna show Aub how to dye her hair as they were both getting theirs done purple, hence why Aub has dyed hair in RW!<. . >!My assumption is it’s a guilt thing, with Sunny not believing he (and Basil) deserved Maris purple like the others do !<
This reminded me of an OMARI fanfic i was reading where before (Spoilers for the fanfic!!) >!omori heads out of headspace to help hikki (aka mari in her headspace) his friends and sister in his headspace color him in their color (surprisingly, the color doesn't come off :D)!<
>!Mari's body was found, there are two impostors Among Us!<
Who has the other bed he considers comfortable? Mari?
Bot en’s “ayo the pizza here” is activating quite a lot for having such a low chance
Nope, evil heromari would have Mari be the one who gave birth
We need a second Mari in case something happens to the first one
Don't worry, Mari will be fine, and Hero is tough enough to survive falling down the stairs
There is not a single thought in Mari’s head right now.

This is... scarily accurate to the game's art style.
I will be instantly impressed if anyone can draw accurate to the game’s art style since it’s reminiscent of colored pencil and crayon drawings, which are hard to do.
and the mari suplexes hero 
Just because she can
Mari is Undyne confirmed????
>!its a shame mari wasn't undying tho!<

>!idk man, falling down a flight of stairs is probably nicer then melting while you're still alive!<
yeah sure the first seems worse to me its mire humiliating
Unlike Omori who doesn't succumb

LMAO >!THAT WOULD MAKE A GOOD BOSS FIGHT!<

But that’s just a-
Thanks for that image, you ——.
I'm so sorry, but the first photo reminded me of [this meme ]()
Damn it, I was just about to comment this exact meme
That’s exactly what I thought of, I’d love to see someone talented make an animation using this audio with this pairing 
[no need to thank me]()
I love this
r/beatmetoit
Aww they're so cute! 
. . 
Heromari is my soul
OUR soul   . r/accidentallycommunist
#Omori tagged Mari. . ^a ^little ^too ^hard


According to the wiki, it says that Hero and Mari are love interests. . This is so cute
Tbf it was kinda obvious from the beginning
"You're so cute when you're all flustered" -Mari to hero
“Hey handsome…or would you prefer What’s cookin’ good lookin” 
Mari wants to be cucked

Wtf 

She was a literal child
NTR does not discriminate
NTR doesn't exist in this game
Yeah lmao
I mean not even according to the wiki they just straight up are
>!....or were!< 
I wish I was this good at drawing so I can make rw mari(the one from the ter shirt art with purple hair) and rw basil tags.
This is so accurate to the game's artstyle, this is incredible work, congrats <3.
Good really good. . Also i need more
"You tagged Mari" 
Partly. . i meant all the taging photos that mari can be in
Mari tagged you! 
>!sound of person tumbling down stairs!<
🔪



Mari is pogging
So cute
TOO WHOLESOME! 
This is actually really accurate to the games style for once, props to the creator
heh\~
this is so cute I’m melting
torazi has made my day, i wish she could’ve been playable in the console versions but i’ll recover(i wont)
this is so wholesome that the amount of dopamine my body is currently producing is overwhelming
You've unlocked: Hidden trauma!
the first image reminds of this lol 
How does you even get close to this art style? It’s so well done
awwww
 mari

Nah thats a platonic hug
I kiss my homies goodnight, platonically
I cuddle with the homies at night platonically
I proposed to my best homie, platonically
i am happily married to my homie, platonically
that is not of consequence
My heart just melted
This makes my heart ascend
make mari tag all of them
Awww, they're so adorable!!  I love Heromari sm.
These are too cute 
pretty wholesome
It's.... it's accurate wtf
I wish
Omori next version.
 waaahhh its too cudte hhel m
Better title: "if mari wasn't given the safety of a picnic blanket" or "if sunny could bear seeing his sister die again"
OHHHH I LOVE THEM SO MUCH WAHHHHH MANN........ MARIIIII
Mari pog
imagine you are playing mario sunshine and your mother comes around and says “hey I named you after that game” and shows her sperdrun wr in it
I think I would be very surprised that my name was inspired by a Nintendo game.
who wouldnt honestly.    . but you get to say “its a me mari!” for the rest of your life
Yeah,this would be true xD
lmao
Mari : " I can speed run from the 2nd floor to 1st floor too mom look!"
Oh no
XD OH GOD NO!
"MARI NO-"
\*PFFT\*
wait when *were* they born
Given that it’s been sorta deciphered that the game takes place in the late 90s or early 2000s, it’s safe to assume the cast was born in the late 80s
>!Mari would be in her late 30s or even 40s by now...!<
Key word "would've"
Definitely in the 80's, Mari and Hero in the early 80's while the rest were born in the late 80's, while the RW gameplay takes place in the early 2000's. . I have a bad sense of time so this probably makes no sense at alll
make mari do a blj at the stairs
Lol
Source op? As in, yknow, link to the person who actually drew it?
[Hello mate!!! Here's the pink to the artist and the post I'm deeply sorry if I didn't show before!]()
Wait, isn’t nightmargin the one who made OneShot?
I think he did the OST
Canon XD
[Link to the artist and the post!]()
Oh that's very informative. Thank you, Fourth Wall Cognizant Version of Sunny & Mari's Mom.
OMORIO
*casually mentions that your existence isnt canon to your own children*
Holy shit
She gonna name her next one Super
Clark
This is hilarious, I love it!
Bruh I just watched RTGame's Super Mario Sunshine supercut yesterday
Her hair named them that. Notice that the speech bubble is closer to her hair than to her face.
>!Sunny used the F.L.U.D on Mari and she fell 🗿!<
my favorite mari game. . Super Mari Suni
I love me some sunshine
this is hilarious-
Oh wow, nightmargin drew this! Oneshot and omori are both amazing \^\^
Super Mari Sunny!
If they were born in 2002 then omori would take place in 2018.. . I would legit pay for a "modern" omori. I would want to see how it plays out asides from all of the Jokes and memes.
oh man mari and sunny's mom must me a serious gamer
Im laughing like, Crazy
Oh my Konami, this better be canon.
Let's send you to have picnic with Mari again.
Mari: ***frustrated ghost noises***
y e s
She deserves to be the ceo of Macdonalds for putting a extra nugget.
“The more Nuggei in the pack,the more customers we gain.”—Mari
Ye
Big Sis is not just a pianist, she’s also a best marketing girl.
Is that the plural of nuggie?
Hero spends all his life savings to go to McDonalds just to see mari
Then he gets Infinite nugget when he show up.
Eternal ~~banana~~ nugget
Mari saying fuck capitalism has become the 2nd highlight of my day
she has nothing to lose but her chains >!and a jump rope!<
It is the second lowlight of mine.
Don't mind her, she's just hanging around, doing her job
Yeah but not that “Hang”
>!She's hanging alright!!<
What in the love of god and everything sacred is this account name of yours?
I don't know, maybe >!Mari's spirit!< knows.
The tought of Mari knowing about that shit scares me to a whole new level that I didn't knew existed
I'm sorry.

[Artist ]()
It's still just using somebody else's art for internet points.
At least I give credit and don’t act like that’s my art.
Credit in the post next time, barely anyone is gonna lookat that comment
In a way it’s promotion, I didn’t know about the artist until I saw this post
Just because someone made a small mistake doesn't mean you can go to their other posts and say rude shit. They made a post to apologize and you still went and harassed them about it.
We made up and are on good terms now
posting interesting content you found elsewhere online is literally the point of reddit
“no, we don’t serve pizza here”
MariDonald's
McMari!
Two Extra Biscuits
comrade Mari is the last thing I expected to see today, but I welcome it
at my old job I would just stuff the bag as full as I can
Maridonalds, for those of you in the discord
Lol she would be one of those spoiled teens
But the Macdonald gain more customer so spoil teen isn’t that bad lol 👀
She doesnt leave orders hanging at least
now i want burger king sunny vs macdonalds mari
Guys she's just saving money for university thats it. Like a part time job in maridonalds
Suddenly, McD is now my favourite fast food restaurant
Aaaaaaaaa it's too adorable
Wait, since Mari's dead.... . IS THAT GHOST MCDONALDS?
yes
yooo remember to credit op!!! btw the original artist here is uhhh @/RAlNYSTORMY on twitter :smirk:
I put the link to artist those.
AU idea: they order chicken nuggets instead of pizza and mari is delivering it
nuggies
Yes
now we just need the sweetheart Wendy Vs Mari MC donalds
Wait she is a commie? Oh man liberty prime is not going to be happy about this
Mari was secretly part of the Red Brigades and participated in the kidnapping of Aldo Moro
You're Awesome!
:D
Hope you do well!
Hey did you uh, ask the artist before uploading this?
Uhm....no but I credit the artist.
I don't wanna sound mean but you should probably ask before uploading someone's work next time
Ok but the Artist sometime not gonna response much so when I upload Will alway credit the artist.(That’s not my art and I understand what should i do).. . I upload it on Reddit because just for content and I want to see more interaction with people who are Omori Fan more cause Twitter seem pretty low interaction there and Twitter have a lot of “problem”,hope you understand.
Next time you should probably ask.
Sure I will.Only they answer or not.

My Twitter account have a little bit of problem so I can’t not chat with the artist for now.. . But if you can tell him that I’m sorry cause I didn’t asked him about that yet.. . But I will credit the artist and not me.
i dont have a twitter
Oh that’s alright cause I just do that so thanks.
New headcanon: mari works at ghost macdonalds and she fixed the ice cream machine
mari would definitely be a music teacher tradwife, this hc seems kinda out there
Nice art theft
I put the artist link and yes that not my art.
I'm pretty sure this isn't OP's art unless they are @RAINYSTORMY on Twitter, this person stole this. Edit: I see they credited the artist, still though it's petty art theft for what? Internet points?
I put the link to the Artist those,I’m not gonna steal it.
I do it for content and interaction you can go like for the artist.
FUCK CAPITALISM
omg mari at mcdonal
"Fuck capitalism!" Mari said, with a smile on her face whilst putting in another nugget for the customer.  . . Now imagine that in the lost library
Communist Babil approves this
Someone did Brazilian miku and it became a trend. There's even Brazilian mari
The 10th was Mari'd
: we only do a little bit of trolling, see even mari agrees!. . 
: Say something, Mari! Don't >!leave us Hanging!<

He was in a goofy mood


   . 🏥
Close
that to 100 real fast
: >!WHY THE FUCK DID YOU HANG MARI!<. . : bleh hehe
>!didn't maris perfectionism get her killed?!<
Not lore accurate: >! Mari needs to die /j !<
💀

💀💀💀
Well I guess we know what OP needs to do now...
I saw that and I was like "wtf" and then realized you were talking about the game :P
>!OMARI AU real!<
I dressed up as Mari last year and shared my photo around doing this (note the big staircase that I presumably descended before having this photo taken, and the implications of that):. . 
LMAOOO that's awesome
Thanks!
>!If we're going by when Mari uh, slipped, then see you in a year. Or not see you.!<
I’m holding on that headcanon now. Everything after the recital never happened. Mari’s not in the best shape, but she’s okay.
In this timeline Mari >! fell down the stairs like a Family Guy gag. !<
Just like >! Mari !<
STOP IT 
Make me
(That was a joke-)
AHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Yeah like that’s ever gonna happen!. . I would love to see a Mari in a wheelchair fanfic
Would Mari be this forgiving or would she be pissed
YOU GAVE MARIO THE BIG SAD... :(
>Shapeshifter Mari. . I kinda like this idea of Mari being an Eldritch being, that after millennia of... being an Eldritch being, (and doing nothing), found joy into living a human life.. . That would be a very interesting slice of life-ish fanfic
. . this and its sequel are *exactly* what you're looking for.
real or Mari's >!if she's alive in the universe these drawings take place in!<

"I'm...the real reason that Mari died". . "Mama mia!"
If this quote is from the skit I'm thinking of, I feel very sorry for what's about to happen to Mari.

You got me haha
Also is it just me or does Mari look like commiting lenny face
in the headspace sprite when she says it she looks like that
I like to think there are thousands of Headspace Maris throughout Headspace that communicate together as a hivemind.
Mari hivemind. . Mari hivemind
Like in Pokémon with the Nurse Joys (except with a hivemind)
expand your mind, omori!
>!considering there's multiple something like Dorothy in the train, this seems possible!<
Mari movin like Sans
DUDU Du Du
>! To be fair Omori created that situation just to protect Mari from going on adventures and possibly dying again just like how she died irl as stated in the true route !<
Spoiler didn't work
my friend has this joke headcannon that mari is sonic
Headcanon that there are multiple Maris in Headspace.
MARI is AFRAID
MARI is STRESSED OUT

Why is Mari wearing a tuxedo then
Why wouldn't she be?

Because
Mari came back to life for the sole purpose of watching Minions: The Rise of Gru.
>!Wait if Mari is dead is that her body ?!<
>!Probably not. The events of the game happen 4 years after the accident, so it would be quite decomposed at that point.!<. . >!Oh! Maybe Sunny became a movie director, with that imaginative mind of his, and this is his first movie? That could explain the existence of Schrodinger's Mari.!<
Omori: the fall of Mari 
i know this is a joke but isnt aubrey wanting to dye her hair with mari a main plot point or smth >!and then mari dyed early?!<. . WHO GAVE THIS THE WHOLESOME AWARD?

I hate you here's an upvote and an award

Ong she resembles mari a bit 
Bro this is your chance. Be their Mari and ask them out. (Oh and buy them a Mari plush while you're at it to say thank you!)
>!Mari was first to join actually... and first to leave!<
That's very true,>! like after the incident they never had that chemistry ever again, probably even after the ending, the death of Mari both had a negative and mental impact on them.!<. . Friendship is easily forgiven but not in this case, they were so devastated...

She's making sure her friends are happy!
~~Menacingly!~~
He's going to >!visit Mari.!< How wholesome!
No, the white ghost with black hair. That black ghost is Mari’s alternate costume
Ok here >!You can actually see Mari in the HALLOWEEN text in the image!<
Oh fuck Mari. . . She's watching
COMMA PLEASE!
“Oh, fuck Mari. She’s watching”
Phew, that's better
I can see Mari
>!Especially when he's standing in the window like ghost Mari did!<
>!I'm confused... Shouldn't mari be the mummy?!<
Look out the window
>!Ghost Mari in the window !<
We got depressed, pink hair lady and the smol Mari
**She has supernatural power**. . >!Also trauma can’t touch her!<
protect the mari
Their kid looks like a little Mari and I think that is absolutely adorable.
Is Mari not just sunny with long hair and no depression?
Sunny with no depression didn’t seem to be as social as mari
I meant the appearance...
man imagine if she even acts like Mari. sociable, hard working, etc. that would be so complicated for sunny
"Reincarnated as my little brothers daughter"
Iirc artist was inspired by a fanfic where sunburn results in a girl they name Mari so her similiar apperance is fitting.. . Man i can imagine Mari looking down from heaven/or as a ghost and being so happy the 2 of them became a thing and sunny not only forgave himself and connected with Aubrey but even brought another life into the world.
Where's the link for the fanfic?

Man, it was fun writing that fic.
Thank you for linking this wholesome overload.  :)
The link doesn’t work 😭
Original writer deleted their account sadly
Aw :(

Omori 2: Mari's Revenge
143 suddenly has a different meaning-
i fuck you🤣 i push you i hate you
Rainy Mari endorsement?
Normally I define an RPG as a game where you preform different commands to go against a set goal of some sort after a given "go" sign, like OFF's meters or Mario and Luigi's blocks
what about pokemon
The end of the opponents turn, to work towards depleting the health bar
I'll be honest I'm still not exactly sure what you're talking about, sorry.
Time for the Super Mario 64 speedrun!

RemindME! 1 day "How’s mari doing"
So how’s mari doing
I fucking love that Mari concept
Haha funny that you brought up danganronpa since Mari and Kaede have 2 things in common

I did not expect you to go there
💀
HAHAHAHA I KNOW RIGHT JAHSHSIWBAJWBNQ
Be more terrified, >!that’s Mari hanging. That’s why she’s so tall!<
I'mma be really honest with you here, I'm more scared of the unknown. >!Also Mari's face being covered in the shadow made me think it was hellmari again so that was much scarier!<
Long arms
Just realized Maria arm somehow goes through the sink near the tooth brush. That’s a minor mistake omocat never even realized. Now have fun getting slightly annoyed everyone!
Gangly is the name of the hallucination game.
That's what I thought at first as well, but we know that Sunny, who is barely taller than Omori, is malnourished, from photos that Mari is noticeably taller than Omori, from portraits that she looks older as a >!ghost!<, and that >!ghosts can hover!< based on the >!window scenes in the final duet and the shore area!<.
barely taller than omori? i thought he was at least like a foot taller
>!They're almost as tall as each other when shown standing next to each other in the cutscene after Final Duet.!<
No, Mari is that tall because >!she’s a ghost and ghosts float!<
i don't think it is though, when she was hanging, her hair covered her face (except for one eye)
True true
wait i just realised why are her arms so long
Fun fact (contains spoilers) >!if I remember correctly this mirror scene suppose represents mari hanging, thats why shes tall!< (correct me if Im wrong)
"fun"

Base comment warns there are spoilers, if people see this one they are supposed to not care about spoilers, why should I do it ¯\\(ツ)/¯
Because those are the rules of the subreddit, your comment has been removed for Rule 4 violation.
Ok I guess
>!that doesn’t make sense because mari dies after being accidentally pushed down the stairs by Sunny from what I’ve heard!<. . Edit: fuck I did the || || thing bc I thought reddit uses it for spoilers like discord
>!and yet he managed to convince everyone it was a suicide. hmm...!<. . maybe finish the game.
Listen, >!the bruises and broken bones and dried blood on the violin, people knew. The dad knew. The mom probably knew, and they’re probably divorced because of her sweeping it under the rug.!<
That's actually a really interesting theory
Thank you!. I am most jntelligence.
>!Basil could've hidden the broken violin in the toybox after he hung Mari, so Sunny's parents wouldn't know that it exactly broke, just that it was missing!<
>!I’m not talking about the violin, I’m talking about the marks that would obviously show on a someone who just fell down several flights of stairs. You think they wouldn’t notice any bruises or blood or maybe some left over blood on the part where she fell? She had cuts on her from the violin strings and jagged wood. It was brutal. Plus her hair would be a mess. There would be signs everywhere that something happened before the “suicide” and then the little part where it shows a man chopping down a tree telling him he’s not his son? Yeah, it wasn’t as clean a cover up as a first time viewing may lead you to believe.!<
I haven’t finished the game because it’s been really hard... I keep dying to the bosses... am I underleveled or something?
who are you stuck on, and what level are you?. . also, have you been utilizing emotion? i've noticed the game gets way harder without it.
There are three options. Underleveled, Not enough healing items, or you don’t use Emotion right. Try to fix these as much as possible, and you will be good to go.
I'm so sorry that you got spoiled bro
If u finished it will make sense
Mari be like: missed me 🗿?
Def Mari's Spirit, Hellmari doesn't even bear a resemblance
Yeah, it's all kind of vague, there's no way to know if it's Mari's spirit or not. Personally, I always thought it made more sense if this (and others) were Mari's spirit, but it's open ended enough that most theories can work
Hellmari does appear after this even, so I'm not entierly sure...
No it's because >!Mari was hanged!<
Wait a minute.... . Thats not hellmari. . Thats Mari's Spirit. . Shes there to protect Sunny (i think)
people thought it was HellMari?
Yes
This photo takes place after Sunny basically left Basil to die so I think it’s more disappointment/sadness from Mari
uuuh no? it takes place after sunny seeing\* mari playing the piano
Oh fr?
*oh*
Oh ya I already saw Mari's mouth without brightening the image on my first playthrough and I was confused as on why it wasn't distorted like >!Hellmari's!<
>!Spirit!< Mari actually looks older than Headspace Mari, do >!ghosts age !<or sumthin?. . Edit: Spoiler Tags
She calls him 'little brother' in her ghost form even though she's younger, so it seems ghosts do age in this game.
So that means Mari is 19, or 20 if we count her last birthday (Also Hero's 21 now right?) - (Correction - I'm poor at math)
Wasnt that should happen when you have high WTF value + shouldn’t open the door to hellmari’s jumpscare ? It’s extremely rare from what i know
Mari is looking bright as ever
>!You can see Mari's face!<
Make sure you mark comment for spoilers since post doesn't have the tag

Imagine if that's not Mari >!when she was hanging !< but she was actually that massive
God damn Mari's tall
Wow mari is tall
I shat myself when I first saw this. . Though I shat and pissed myself when I opened the door to Mari
Mari is so tall omg-
Mari is a tall sister.
i thought he was pulling out the mari window and was like HOW DOES HE KNOW
He's done a lot of diagrams. His disco elysium playthrough is compelling as he analyzes the characters. Definitely a channel to watch
God, I want to watch that, but I'd have to finish my own playthrough of the game first...
Me too, I was actually yelling “MARI HEEEELP” aloud when I was running for the save point (it  didn’t help I read the emotion chart backwards
>In my opinion this game leaves a lot of clues and hints that will go over heads of people who do not have the necessary experience to pick up on them. . There is a whole implied background story for Mari that almost no one considers bcs they don't analyse the subtle (non-Christian) religious/spiritual details and ignore both Headspace and ghost lore bcs they want the conflict to be purely psychological and "realistic." Like, that's fine and all but doesn't explain the point of stuff like the Shinto-themed lake statue, the Headspace altar, the yokai-based designs of Something/Hellmari, Old Beardy hearing spirits etc.. . >Kel and Hero's mother is a narcissist . . It's more complicated than that. Kel and Hero are implicitly from a south-of-the-border immigrant family, and their family is a subtle criticism of immigrant parenting. Immigrant families move to provide better lives for their children, and every parent wants their children to succeed. It's not healthy to pressure your child into be a top 1% breadwinner at the expense of their own happiness and completely ignoring your "less-successful" children.. . The narrative parallels imply that Mari and Sunny likely had a similar home life. We know they're at least half-Japanese from their dad's side, and that Mari was under insane academic pressure to the point of taking college prep late night classes at 14-15. Her perfectionism and obsession with a "perfect" recital performance makes more sense under the implication that it was for college credentials.. . >Deep pressure is something that is used in therapy for autistic people and things like weighted blankets are commonly used.. . I hadn't considered that! Flashback Sunny is shown to love hugs, cuddle piles, and burying himself in stuffed animals, so it def tracks!

This is true, but I'm personally noticing the opposite - people being so invested into Headspace lore that they forget there is a human behind this game, who has their own experiences and the game is filtered through that. Omocat is Chinese-American and I'm sure her experiences have influenced both Kel and Hero as well as Sunny and Mari's story, you provided a few interesting examples which I agree with.. . >>Kel and Hero's mother is a narcissist. . >It's more complicated than that.

It's not healthy to pressure your child into be a top 1% breadwinner at the expense of their own happiness and completely ignoring your "less-successful" children.. . That is a great point, but it doesn't clash with what I said, I think both are true. Notice how their mother reacts to Hero saving Basil and Sunny. You know, Hero literally being a hero and saving his two childhood friends, one of whom is now standing in front of her, soaking wet. Doesn't matter because her precious dinner got cold.. . > The narrative parallels imply that Mari and Sunny likely had a similar home life.

Her perfectionism and obsession with a "perfect" recital performance makes more sense under the implication that it was for college credentials.. . Those are very interesting points as well. I have been wondering about Sunny and his parents relationship, especially his father, because before the accident, he seems almost codependent on Mari. I still need to finish hikikomori route, maybe I'll find some clues there. In general I think one of the strongest yet completely unspoken theme of this game is how none of this children have parental figures who they can rely on.
The last part you mentioned is insanely wholesome..., very comfy vibes.
Mari is Autistic!!
So... Omori, Omari, Omoli, and... Omoji? . . Am I missing anything?. . Also, does Omor count too?
i omor💀
what about omoj?
Yes, that too 
is it just me or does that look like hellmari
it looks like hellmari
The mari cat has never been more aggressive than in this little sketch
There's like 4 versions of that drawing for different merchandise releases. You're obviously not supposed to think about it that much, but I like the idea that they're somehow promoting the video game they're in. Imagine if God showed up and explained that there's a world full of creatures at the same cosmic level of existence as him ... and then paid you to hold a cute doll of yourself they're interested in buying.. . I also enjoy that it looks like Mari is wearing the picnic blanket as a skirt, like she didn't own any other clothes and had to improvise.. . EDIT: actually, that God comparison is way funnier for the "real world" version of that image. "God shows up, brings your dead girlfriend back to life, tells you to hold her hand one last time, and then kills her again."

Stares also in fear as >!she should not be breathing!<. . *Mari has been ejected*
This is one of the best comments I’ve ever seen on this subreddit. but also I hate you
i hate you so much. take my fucking upvote.
Thank you very much :)
Y'know I think Kamala Harris would be a great pick for Mari
i mean amy winehouse has something in common with mari tbf
I think Kamala would be a bit more fitting for Mari than    image not found    but this is pretty much perfect, can't wait for the live action movie to be casted by those people.
it is announced mari will be voiced by chris pratt in flashback sequences
nah mari is still played by snoop dogg but he has the snapchat woman filter on the entire time
I think Kamala Harris would work well for mari
The Mari one is vile
Image not found for Mari is vile
I think it would make sense if the Grandma got split into Mari and Polly. . . Mari acting as a direct influence on the group in the past headspace and Polly being a great demonstration of how much of a recluse and withdrawn he is even with someone who is trying to get close. . . Proba
Can you link me to Mari's first appearance? I have read both the omori story comic and omoriboy pages and haven't seen her in either
Late reply, but here ya go!   . . . 
Found on the OMORI website btw
I want to see how Mari looks like in this style
This confirms the theory that artist is just Mari in disguise
“It was me, Mari!”
Kono Mari Da
another proof of how the artist is>! just a disguised mari living as angels sister!<
Ur cake day is on mari’s bday!!!!
That's funny, I just noticed, that means I joined reddit on her birthday. Funny coincidence.
Lol I think she’s 21 now 😳
Ok?
Oh, which reminds him of the house and therefore also >!Mari!<..
yeah, Sunny wanted nothing in headspace to remind him of >!what happened with Mari!< and if the drink Orange Joe, and that text was in Headspace.. . >!It could remind him of Mari, then maybe the Recital and Violin. Then Mari's death. And Sunny wanted forget the truth about Mari's death, and that would make him remember.!<
>!Especially since Mari got really mad at Kel in the memory, and the incident is associated with them getting mad at each other!<
>!Yeah, Mari did get mad a Sunny. And then he pushed. So if Headspace Mari got mad at someone, Sunny may get reminded of the recital.!<
>!And it's one of the key memories that help him remember!<
Plus, it was in the Lost Library
This is the 4Kids! version, where Mari just passes out and is in a coma for 4 years
I see it as an effect of Omori projecting a protective influence associated with Mari. Big sis wants you to drink healthy milk, not caffeine.
a Mari
As I stated earlier, those kinds of names are blocked to prevent mood whiplash during the more serious scenes.. . Like, it would be pretty hard to take the story seriously if Mari was saying things like ">!You'll forgive yourself... won't you, FUCKER!<?"
>!Can't wait for the RW Mari plushie :)!<
>!a corpse!<. . >!(jk it might js be the whitespace mari)!<
>!you think it’ll come with the dirt from her grave?!<
>!Knowing these guys it's probably just gonna be a small something plush sadly the marketing team REALLY hates RW Mari!<
Tragic side effect of >!her very existence being a spoiler.!<
I don't even think it's that, because they could've just gone with the design with the purple coat and spotted dress>! if spoilers were a concern!<.. . 
They did make a keychain of her
😭Bro knew 
>!we already have a something plush!<
>!the something appears on 3days left, aka semi-spoiler but you're forced to meet it!<
were not going to get one however were gonna get some cool christmas tree ornaments with her (=
Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻Please make rw Mari and not Something 🙏🏻
They probably ARE gonna make something since thats what they have been doing in merch alreafy- I HATE it though since it alone kinda spoils >!mari's death!<
One can pray
People shouldn't really be looking at merch without playing the game and somebody who just sees it randomly probably won't make the connection
Yeah, I think people here take spoilers too seriously. It's understandable when it's in the main post, but I doubt a person that has yet to finish the game would open the comment section of a reddit post that has like 99% chance of containing a spoiler.
Please at least make the design with the purple jacket and spotted dress. . 
you don need to repeat allat 😭🫸🫷 (cant find the 🙏 emoji )
Personally, I hope we get a Spirit Mari Plushie; but normal Mari would also be nice (besides, they might do both).
Omg finally.  . But for God's sake, i hope we get a>! rw Mari like the shirts merch poster and not another freakin something!<

Look at the link where is says source ?
the link you didn’t bother to post and someone else had to?
Dont. Your amazing the way you are
🗿

🥚













i had this same exact thought lol
For people wondering why Mari is written as Abusive, search for "Omori Arachnophobia Cut Dialogue"  . It's very... disturbing.
seriously omocat gave her best to try and make the cutest character of the game just to instantly kill it. My heart warms when I look at Mari x Hero fanarts and arts in-game.
🤨📷
😳 but 🍔 better
Burgers on my minddd
ayo the pizza here
I'm going to throw her into a woodchipper

i believe in you, go for it!! :D

Mari is so cool I wish I was a girl

İ agree she is my favorite game character and she is so damn pretty

GYAT DAMN

Good question
Hi
Mari literally means husband in french.
Ye
SHE'S PERFECT
well he was wearing a different outfit when mari died so he had to have changed at one point
Also canonically >! Mari is the shortest being -6 feet !<
Foul
Mari, she looks weird without her hair
>!Mari’s at the front!<
>!immune to 100% of all attacks, they just pass right through her!<
>!she inflicts emotional damage!<
>!EMOTIONAL DAMAGE!!<
>!On the other hand, Mari could be the weakest character since she doesn't actually exist and thus can't actually do any damage to the characters(unless emotionally like they already said.!<. . >!I personally like to think it was just a hallucination since if she was real it would lessen the impact of the game since she wasn't really gone, but then the whole piano scene with Hero raises a whole bunch of questions.!<
I wish i was mari
Ok, Kewl.
At the price of Just vanishing?
shut UPP 
Omg smosh intro???
then mari appers and whoops all 5 of them . . 
Tbf she has no clip
POV: you hurt one of her beloved ones
>!I thought Mari was six feet under?!<
new one is worse in my opinion he just keeps knocking knowing he wont get an answer also because of the hell mari scene it sounds kinda scray hearing knocks
That's the point it's to try to scare you into not opening the door and going down the hikikomori route, going against your fears is a big motif of this game
after mari's *what*
Both the people closest to Mari are represented in black and white  in headspace.
Yeah just to say… if you hear mari knocking on the door… open it and you will definitely not get a jumpscare😁
its not mari x stairs so no
I know, I don’t enjoy ships relevant to this game at all, any game with a primarily child cast and also has a horror theme shouldn’t mess with ships (ask never mentioned anything about sexuality)
Rw mari
Mari
mari in headspace🫥
Mari
Yes i am chaotic evil
Mari 
Mari.
mari tastes like pizza
More like stairs
Ok but why is high quality smug Mari so uncanny?
because it was made by a computer, and computers are demonic.
True. I poured holy water on my computer and it stopped working immediately
I also agree.
no shit
Mari is also wearing the same clothes tho, and aubr has those weird eyelashes and blue eyes
i mean yeah, it's a uniform.. . it's not really as weird as you make it out to be.
Pee
babil poopy ball omori peepee poo omari balls
True
wise words
HS Mari’s hair is *wide*
Yup Aubrey's hair is very straight while Mari's is kinda poofy and voluminous. Plus Aubrey has a bow and her expressions are more energetic while Mari's expressions are more laid back.
“You’re Back Mari”
NO
IM LITERALLY READING IT RN 
Loved that fic, the sequel..... eh
Huh? Context?
You dont want to know
do people really not like this fic so much?
It's a fic on ao3
About?
Hero makes Sunny pretend to be Mari
Can you drop the fanfic name please? Looks cursed enough to want me to read it
If you pay the toll gators in headspace, Mari will get mad that you did so and offer you some of her savings in compensation. I missed that on my first playthrough and I thought it was really sweet lol
You're not supposed to pay them!!! They're con artists!
listen bud, i earned that money through the fair art of gambling. also it's so convenient to be able to walk right through without having to face a bunch of enemies
And between killing those enemies and the shark boss you’ll actually get enough money to pay for it
I still played them tho because going through the whole area full of enemies was very annoying.
I remember doing that, she gave me 500 clams when I had 70k from gambling addiction.
Truly a caring sister :(
I need a clip of this 🥺 Missed this on my playthrough too
>! She is always five feet behind you at all times !<
For me that means she's in the ground half the time  . EDIT: misspelled ground as grond, immortalizing it now for the funny lotr reference (although i have corrected the original sentence)
>!she's actually in the ground all of the time!<
[Mari be like]()
Epic ghost moment, or are you just sleeping?
Reminds me a bit of the time I said "fingering" instead of "figuring"
Did no one really - fine, I'll do it myself! GROND!
I think you mean >!Six feet below!<
I dont get it
The moment you’re supposed to go up with mari swimming if you run on the beach before she’ll tell you to stop because of her bad knee and if you continue you will not be able to run with her anymore
Where can I do this?? And How???,
spoilers maybe?. . . . . . . . . True route, before you swim to the last resort and everyone is gone you meet Mari at the beach, just run around for some time
Ayo the  good bot  here
When did he learn that???
Ohhhh thanks
Why would anyone continue to run even after Mari has said this 😭
GAS-GAS GAS I GOTTA STEP ON THE GAS TONIGHT WHILE WE’RE ROLLING YEEEEAH YEAH YAAH
Well, if you do keep running she will eventually raise her voice at you, after that your run is actually DISABLED until the segment is over.
I think they mention somewhere in the game she has a bad knee but idk if that’s true
She used to be an adventurer like Omori but then she took a softball to the knee
Apparently it's during >!the true route when you are going to the Last Resort, she mentions it on the beach.!<
I think it's also mentioned during >!the post-Humphrey segment in the deeper well, when a voice is talking to dreamer hinting about Black Space and The Truth just before we get teleported back to Neighbors Room, that's the reason she gets to stay within a picnic location all the time to say protected!<. . >!"Your dear sister MARI with a bad knee... You could not bear for her to die again, so she was given the safety of a picnic blanket. Yet it is her nature to leave and to protect. And when she does, she will leave you again and be born anew... with the undying soul that you have cursed her with." !<
Hurt it playing softball :(
Yeah definitely true.
There's a softball bat in the treehouse that says she stopped playing because of an injury, though it doesn't specify what kind it was
I think I remember there being a dialogue where it's stated that Mari used to play baseball and that's how she injured her knee.
She’s left handed in every photo she’s in
Now that’s a cool Mari fact 
Wanna know another cool mari fact? 
yes? 
open the door to find out more!! 
i gently open the door…

you really left her hanging

I fucking lied (I think)
ah yes, another good old day of spreading misinformation
My favorite hobby
My disappointment is immesurable and my day is ruined
You monster I will never trust you again 
I mean idk you could check
Cool! I'm also left handed!
proof?
How?
tbh this comment section made me realise how little we know about mari. she was a perfectionist, she had a bad knee, and she's >!dead!<. not much else
>!Just checked because the Hidden Library is not my freshest memory of the lore, but there's nothing to say Mari put the spider on his shoulder!<. . >!The only ones who tell anything to Sunny are "The brothers." Mari isn't mentioned!<
That last bit's pretty important tho
"oh, sunny! that reminds me! mari and i were talking about dying our hair together. mari says she's going to dye her hair purple."
Dreamworld Mari has purple hair, although that is just the dreamworld colors, it could mean something
And Omori Is the only HS guy not being purple, due to being Made of fears
He rejected the ourple
why he not ourple 💀
He denied the man behind the slaughter
He's the youngest, so the only one who can't drink L E A N
No, he originates from WS not HS. like Hikki, Taco chan and other 2 guys whose names I forgor 💀
I’m pretty sure everyone’s hair in Headspace is purple because Mari wanted to dye her hair that color
>!Ah, you mean the picture where Mari never died. She never got to dye her hair. Aubrey dyed hers after Mari died.!<. . >!Plus, Sunny's Something is black.!<
Oh, that makes sense. Didn't realize that was if it never happened

Not directly about Mari, but it's implied from Omocat's official art that Aubrey has hand-me-downs of Mari's clothes, >!since she won't need them anymore!<
that was one of my theories for so long! i’m happy to know that it was true!
Elaborate please?
In some of Omocat's artwork of the gang >!after Mari died!< , some of the clothing Aubrey wears are some of the clothes Mari wore in-game. Most notably, the blue hair-tie Aubrey always wears is the same as the one Mari wore in the calendar (admittedly not in-game, but still) for March.
Interesting.
if you cook the mari’s cookies without asking her she is going to beat you to death

What can she do?. . >!shes already dead!<
>!She'll come back to life, beat your ass, then die again!<
>! blunt force trauma *and* mental trauma! !<
Cook... them?
Obviously, they're cookies not bakies /s
OMARI AU
If fanart/fiction is to be believed, it's apparently very easy to miss that >!Spirit Mari looks like she's continued to age!<, whether naturally or by intention on her part.. . EDIT: That's not to say I disagree with the presentation. >!Her never getting to grow up!< is thematically appropriate, but it also contradicts the in-game images.
I like to joke that >!Mari’s ghost has aged more than Basil in the last 4 years!<
Yeah, Mari looks older due to having a longer head. A longer head, whether it be Sunny, Aubrey, Basil, Kel, and even Hero means older in Omori.
i think this could be considered real. after meeting mari playing the piano, if you go to the bathroom mirror instead of the hellmari figure you see mari behind sunny. and she is tall. tallmari.
Does tall Mari not have a chance of showing up in the mirror prior to that?. . I just assumed that the "height" was because of her...not touching the ground.
Her name is iram backwards
Iram be like >!I'm alive and stuff lol!<
Funny enough Iram is actually a Persian name for “Heaven”
Some people thinks Mari Is Sans-Undertale
Mari is ness?
No, silly! Mari is >!Claus!<!
No, this is Patrick!
>!The only thing Mari missed was the landing!<
Her name came from her birthday MAR1 (March 1)
Nah, Thats how fast she could run
Running at Mach 1 so often is why she got a bad knee, obviously
But hey, that's just a theory, a game theory!
She runs at March 1?
I assume it's vice versa!
Mari felt that the flower crown she made wasn't good enough, which Basil found to be pretty. . . Mari teased and seemingly bickered with Hero not unlike Kel with Aubrey. . . Mari bought Basil the Album. . . Mari is adamant about eating fresh fruits. . . Mari played once Softball. . . Mari gave Sunny her bed, because he had nightmares with his old one. . . Mari really loved Sunny.
Yeah
she thought she could out pizza the hut
Her hubris was her own undoing. 
ayo the pizza here
good bot
Good bot
Good bot
I think it's stated that Mari used to play baseball and that's how she injured her knee.. . And maybe that's the reason as to why Aubrey carries a nailed bat as a "weapon" even though she doesn't use it. It might have been from Mari.
Oh damn I never thought of that, she has her bow too 😢
Oh that makes sense
EVERY Mari is real, even the scary ones. Regular mari is the scariest
She loves pizza!
I mean, I think that's a given for almost any fictional character. . Edit: I only just now understood the joke
Who said anything about fictional?
True, I don't think I've met a single person before who genuinely dislikes pizza
My friend Jeremy dislike Pizza.. . Edit: Also burger, honey, milk, lettuce, yogurt and sushi's neither. His favourite food is pony.
IT KEEPS HAPPENING
I WARNED YOU ABOUT STAIRS BRO I TOLD YOU DAWG I TOLD YOU
Ayo pizza here
>! she’s dead !<
Super easy to miss right there
No shit? Must've missed that part
It breezes past people on the first playthrough. You normally only realize the second or third time
Wait, wait. Is there much concrete proof >! Mari died !< in the Hikikomori route? Outside the Boss Rush expansion and some vague distorted images?
Hmm, you’re right. Although >! her death !< is a popular fan theory, it might not be true!
Wait really?! During my play through I completely missed that! Thanks for the information bro!
No problem :)
>!no, the only "hint" the player gets is when you complete hangman, it shows Something and then the game crashes. after you complete it, the whole hangman is scribbled out!<
Mari is called mari because her parents called her that
Don’t you just wanna hug her?
Yes
This is a whiteboard drawing huh
This is more just fun facts than stuff that's easy to miss, because a lot of this isn't even directly from the game itself:. . * >!Mari died in October, because the 9/22 photo says the recital is "next month." She was also 15 when she died, because Hero says he's 15 in Headspace and Mari implied being in the same class as Hero.!<. * In the real world photo album, 3/9 says "we're staying home for the weekend," 4/9 says "on the way home from school today," 6/22 says "it's the first day of summer vacation," and 9/9 says "it's the first day of school." Hero's portrait and the arcade machines also say "199X," meaning the game either takes place in 1991 or 1996. If it's 1996 (just seems more likely with the game details), >!Mari would have been 15 in 1992, and her birthday is March 1st (hah, MAR1) while she died after her birthday that year, meaning!< she was probably born in 1977.. * >!The game hints that either spirit Mari is real or that coincidentally Hero hallucinates her too, because Hero hears her playing the piano when Sunny visually hallucinates her at the piano.!<. * She played softball until she permanently injured her knee, also hindering her ability to run>!, which I assume is mentioned because that would affect her balance.!<. * She was going to be named Mary in early development>!, and there's concept art of her with "Maryonette" written under it (strings.. hanging..). The versions of Something with actual names (Dorothi, Cindi, all those) were also going to have the typical spelling (Dorothy, Cindy, etc).!<. * >!She was gonna dye her hair purple and Aubrey would dye her own pink, which is why Aubrey's hair is pink in the real world and most Headspace characters have purple hair.!<. * There's multiple parts of the game that associate her with the number 143 >!(the trailers, her battle defense is 143, you can access Black Space 2 if you wait 143 seconds in a part of Black Space)!<, "I love you.". * >!In scrapped text for the truth album, it says Mari blocked Sunny, saying she "wasn't finished talking."!<. * >!It's possible that her parents know the truth, although almost all of the stuff pointing to that is in Sunny's mind, so not very reliable. The mom says "you're my only son, I can't lose you too," followed by "please be a good boy, Sunny," and there's a statue of her in Black Space 2 that just stares at Omori, gradually becoming more distorted. There's another part of Black Space 2 where the mom says "there, there, Sunny, we'll protect you, everything will be okay," followed by "where's your violin?" There's yet another part of Black Space 2 with the same phone that the mom uses to contact Sunny, which shows a random speech bubble, one of the options being "I know what you did." The dad says "you're not my son" while cutting down the tree in Black Space 2, plus he left after her death (that part's pretty obvious, he's just not there, but Black Space 2 also says "you see a man shutting his car door and driving away" and a another part of the game says "Dad's bonsai tree. It's grown a lot since I last saw it").!<. * >!Her name means "truth."!<. * >!She was pretty mischievous and messed with Hero (as well as Kel from official art of her putting a "kick me" sign on his back), sometimes with bugs. Seems like she actually liked bugs based on the pictures.!<. * >!She may have been intended to be manipulative in some way in early development, because of unused Something dialogue ("please do not resist..." "shut your eyes, and stay very, very still..."). These also had the option of "yes" or "no" as a reply, but no matter what, it would say "you feel something crawling up your \[leg/neck\]."!<. * >!In early production, there were going to be versions of Something related to the fear of public speaking and the fear of attractive people, both of which seem related (confessing, Mari being "perfect" - although the Twitter post mentioning that shows a distorted version of Hero, so that second one might be about Hero).!<. * The game itself seems to not even know if that's Mari or Sunny in the 8/18 photo (even though it definitely is her - long eyelashes, long hair, the blue jacket)>!, because you don't put it back in the photo album with Aubrey, it just reappears, but it was taken along with the photos of Mari.!<. * >!Aubrey has 1 of Mari's dresses (both shown on the Twitter account) and wears her bow (seen in the March part of the calendar project).!<. * Omori is partially named after the brand of piano, and his outfit has features of a piano (black and white with striped shorts like keys lol).. * When sorting Sunny's stuff, he has a "duets for piano and violin" book.
Where did you get her name meaning?
Assuming she's Japanese because of her name and the title of the game, one of the kanji writings (or possibly the most common one) for the Japanese name Mari is [真理]() (*真* pronounced as *ma*, *理* pronounced as *ri*)
thanks!
I firmly believe in ghost Mari.
she is strong,,,, like you would not be able to tell.. . like have you seen [this photo?]() no effort needed. strong.
If she's that strong >!how did a single tumble down the stairs kill her!<
>! Not like a six pack is going to save her from that height !< 
>!AU where Garnet inexplicably catches Mari like in [this]() episode!<
lol yes you got the reference 
>!it wasn't even that high. I could've survived a fall like that when I was three!<
There was some discussion on that a week or two ago. Doesn't really matter how strong you are - the way that >!Mari fell would have caused blunt head trauma followed by a form of spinal damage known as "internal decapitation." To top it off, she landed on the sharp and twisted remains of the violin, which we know caused lacerations if not outright impalement, from the sheet music stored with the violin being "torn and wrinkled from blood." Stairs alone kill a surprising number of people each year, many of them stronger than Mari would have been, and that's without the added peril at the bottom.!<. . I think it's safe to say you would not have survived this at the age of three.
I have a friend who yesterday fell down the stairs and had a seizure from blunt trauma. Dudes built like a truck. Shits crazy

Her and Hero were never an official couple as her dad didn't want her dating. . Here is a source; (2/18 - MY BIRTHDAY): MARI and HERO fell asleep on the couch. They look so cozy together... Hehe... I hope they don't mind the photo. MARI's dad might be kind of mad if he saw it...
Wait, where is it said?
I don't think it's ever said that her dad didn't want her dating anyone, but there is this from Basil's photo album in the real world:. . > MARI and HERO fell asleep on the couch. They look so cozy together... Hehe... I hope they don't mind the photo. MARI's dad might be kind of mad if he saw it.... . I interpreted that as her dad would be mad about them sleeping together on the same couch under the same blanket (too intimate), not mad because they were dating. Or maybe he would be mad at Basil for taking a photo of his sleeping daughter, but I think the first one is more likely.
Thanks
Do you have a source?
The text doesn't say that they're not an official couple
True reason why mari feel down the stars is cuz her pizza was pine apple
Why does she look like she has been drawn with dry erase marker
Not about Mari but whole gang : we can see them selling lemonade in calendar art And I guess that they used that money to buy sunny his violin
i think hero says that him and mari worked at Daphne and Bowens family bakery to help raise money for it i forget where tho . . kel delivered newspapers and the lemonade stand was aubrey and basil's idea
She's a huge perfectionist. I know it's common knowledge but people seem to forget it.
I just woke up, and in my still tired state, I thought that was the actual sprite
Did you know: Mari used to be a dealership of illegal substances when nobody was watching (its behind the scenes trust me)
If you get a game over in headspace, Mari pulls up with a shotgun to the enemy that defeated you.. . /j
She was never a perfect sister.
Cool Mari fact's:. . **She is outside your house**
She has a case of perfectionism and that she wanted to dye her hair purple
that's why almost everyone in hs has purpliah blueish hair
I forgor where and I could be wrong, but Mari’s and Hero’s relationship wasn’t too clear because their parents didn’t fully approve of it
she looks lile she was drawn with a whiteboard pen

Waltzes were always her favorite

there's something weird about her hair
She's not a fan of running, nor walking fast, nor falling.
She's mischevious
She has hair
She's Emo. . hits hard 
She's >!dead!<
She first asks Omori to slow down nicely, and then when he ignores her as she gets more mad she says don't make me raise my voice - we know she is willing to yell in at least dire circumstances, but there's never any indication she's shown anger with physical violence
Mari is short for Marijuana
Her name starts with M for Mari 
She recognized the bodies in the water
ok, very clever
Hey there handsome! Or maybe you prefer… what’s cookin’ good lookin’?
Incredibly panromantic
>!shes dead!<
Mari had to be adamant about keeping fresh fruits in the house - that implies Sunny's parents wouldn't have bought fresh fruit otherwise... how much did Mari have to be the parent?
Here’s a fact, Sunny is roughly 12 feet taller than Mari is.

Okay I know this is unrelated but Mari somewhat reminds me of Servante from that one fnf mod.
If you take away the last letter of Mario, you get Mari
I dunno if this count but i gonna say anyway,if i remmember correctly in the game files there are somenthings that didnt get at the final game,i think this is one of this things.. Mari is the one who came up with the idea for the recital and who came up with the idea for sunny to play the violin,apparently he was also trying the piano.it was supposed to have some pianos scattered in the headspace that if you played them all, there would be like a cutsene of mari talking to Sunny about him learning to read sheet music and that she thinks there is a cover of that song for violin and piano and that they could try.. Shr knew how to make cookies.. She liked limonade.. She liked to paint pictures
We lost Mari again
>!Keep the Hero sprite, leave the Mari sprite missing, but turn Something purple… then build a Something on whatever next they try to create? Probably not, but it’s a nice thought of having it follow them.!<. . >!They killed Mari and she loved them.!<

It’s a sequel to the bad ending of “You’re back, Mari”. Basically: >!Hero went mental!<, >!kidnapped Sunny!< and >!made him involuntarily hikikomori for another 5 years!<. Pretty disturbing, but a good read nonetheless with a satisfying end.
D a m n
Mari’s cookies weren’t that good and everyone pretended to like them to spare her feelings.
Actually that’s kind of cute albeit a little misguided lol. They care about her so much they’ll happily eat her bad cooking just to make her feel good.
that's actually depressing, they only ate their cookies to stop her perfectionistic side from taking her over herself, kinda dark if you ask me
aw cmon, how can someone bake a cookie that bad. i definitely wouldnt buy that

HANDS BY SCITYDREAMER MOMENT????. . (Read it, it's a good fic if you like PAIN)
possibly unrelated, but the games Scitydreamer made are pretty good too



There are a lot of fanfic like that actually
One of my friends really wants this to be the canon ending because she likes Mari a lot
This could potentially fit with the notion of "it's all a dream" and be indicative of his internal journey to overcome his frustration and resentment towards Mari. Though perhaps it could be before the recital, not after, and Mari sees the impact of what she's been doing.

>!A MARI HAS FALLEN DOWN THE STARIS IN FARAWAY TOWN!<
It does talk about how he wanted the violin so that he could play with Mari, so the description contradicts that. I don't think anger would represent the day he got the violin either, I'm pretty sure it only says he just felt pressure. And I feel like the violin would cause sadness if it was related to the death of Mari, probably not anger.
Some people say it's the building block set he was gifted but was more interested in the box it came in.
>! i think he hates the fact that a violin, which was a present from his friends, cause the death of mari, and thus started the game !<

Heromari vore. . Mario vore
Imagine doing kick flips on mari's corpse
Her appearance, to me, Symbolises a more distorted version of Mari that Sunny has imagined.. . Sweetheart is loved by everyone, just like how Mari is loved by everyone.. . Sweetheart believes herself to be Perfect, like how Sunny idolizes Mari to be Perfect.. . If Sweetheart doesn't get her way she gets pissed off and essentially has a Temper Tantrum, and on the day of the recital >!When Sunny was making mistakes Mari was getting more frustrated, and upon breaking his Violin, Mari loses it and starts a fight with him leading to Sunny pushing her down the stairs to her death.!<. . so yeah. that's why i like Sweetheart
yea I have the same head canon. . I always saw SpaceBoy more of a representation of Sunny. Becoming a shut-in after losing an important woman in his life, causing his crew to break apart. . . iirc theres also a part where Hero says he could never marry someone like Sweetheart and that made Mari upset.. . This is all most likely not intended but it does fit
I thought she was literally just the sweet shop lady
that's the parallel to The Real World yeah but the Symbolism with Sweetheart and Capt. Spaceboy gives off a vibe similar to Mari and Hero. just much more toxic obviously (not RW though that shi-- stuff's wholesome)
so, that one really caught my attention, dont know if its true, but I really liked what said! keen!
Oh damn that actually sounds really good
I don’t buy it
that's fair enough, it's just something that i think could be symbolic.. . I don't expect for everyone to believe it nor for it to be considered canon. just something that I came up with after having way too much time on my hand while coming up with OMARI ideas
Her boss theme slaps harder then Mari
Im picturing that one Mari sticker that goes heehee
Super Mario
Mario has hands. Aubrey also has hands.
Mari And William Afton
Mario and Luigi Dream Team
Mario galaxy is the best mario game
mari 2 sounds so funny
Mari 2: she can play the guitar now and is slightly taller!
Same, although I knew OMORI before through DDLC (OMOCAT drew Mari and Monika once), their art in r/place made me joined the sub.. . And made me a HeroMari enjoyer.
He probably kinda needs to. Just like from Mari, everyone have high expectations from him.
Aww, I adore this headcanon! I like to think Mari set him up to it haha!
he HATES horror movies, and mari pretends to hate them too to make him feel better about it, when she actually loves them.
Might be just me but she seems like the type to rub it in and fun tease him over it lol
probably yeah
okay mari
I think it was because his parents wanted him to be a doctor, but yeah, Mari's death could have influenced it also
I think Mari was his inspiration to be a Chef, along with just liking it. But after Mari he couldn’t cook since he related it so much to her and ended up doing what his parents wanted.
Maybe he learned to be a good cook with Mari then
Mari made him follow his own dreams, at the end he didn't have anyone left to motivate him so he just did what his parents wanted
>He was Mari's *wife*. . Lmao
Idk, lore
I meant after Mari dies.
Yeah, it's sad. Though, considering how much the game revolves around Mari, I can see why people would fixate on HeroMari as its the only acceptable Mari ship. Still, its a shame that my boi is kinda underrated by the fandom. . . >!As for my headcanon for his reaction, I agree that he'd take a while before finally forgiving the two, though being able to relate to Sunny in how they both greived Mari's death would probably help.!<
My Headcannon:  . Hero is a little more distant from the rest of the gang. He was mostly there to hang out with Mari, and he initially created the gang by allowing his brother to tag along and meet Mari's little brother, Sunny, because he thought they would get along.. . Overtime he became more parental as a result of following in Mari's steps. But he's no Mari. Instead, he's a bit of the inverse. Mari was as perfect a sister as possible, but struggled with perfectionism in her interests. He has natural prowess in all tasks, but struggles to be a perfect brother to Kel. Occasional outbursts and arguments and fights with Kel happen, but they're mostly just emotional strains.. . Hero pities Sunny, and feels kinship with him on a deep level because he recognizes they both took Mari's death really hard. But really their relationship is still very much surface level, they don't share interests or have dialogue very often with each other.. . I would expect Hero to have some kind of shocked outburst from the truth. He tries to be a good person, and he knows Sunny's been through a lot, so he wouldn't lash out at him but it will probably be in a state shock, unable to process how to respond to this. It might draw him slightly closer to Aubrey and Kel since they would now share the trauma of being lied to in such a big way. He might eventually forgive Basil or Sunny if they stay in touch with Kel and Aubrey, but otherwise he'd won't take the initiative to tell them that.. . Regardless, he would eventually return to pitying Sunny even more, and will develop anxious feelings toward Basil.
I like that! It's like a way for him to accept Mari's death
I feel like nobody discusses Hero outside of HeroMari because... he's just that boring and there's pretty much nothing else people could discuss about, except for his relationship with Mari. His introduction in Faraway Town was really late and the game mostly tells us "He's pressured by his parents to be the best" and >!"He grieves about Mari"!<. That's literally it. I like him, but I can't deny that he's boring.
\#1 Mari Simp
y e s
Mari taught him how to bake her cookies, but doing it makes him too sad now so he doesn’t make them anymore
A headcanon of mine is that after a while of grieving, he chooses to eventually date again; being a more protective yet dorky boyfriend. I see that people don’t show that hero moving on from mari, which is understandable since he was in love with her but... It isn’t healthy to cling onto that. And I picture Mari, seeing Hero in her ghostly form, saw that too and decided to let hero know that he can be happy with someone else too. It’s not disrespectful or hurting her in any way. Saying that he must let go of this pain to finally start healing. . He listens to her advice and slowly but surely finds someone who makes him happy again. . I know this isn’t a popular opinion but hero deserves to be happy.. . >Another head-canon of mine is that hero, when Mari was alive, made little things for her. Like, Mari taught him how to make bracelets or little stuffy chains or so on and he’d pick it up to try and impress her. But after Mari died, the first year without her; he’d always make those same stuffies and bracelets and set on her grave; hoping that she would somehow respond with a laugh or a warm smile. But it never did. So he’d end up leaving more bracelets and stuff and eventually; some people (like bad people or somethin) came and took those items for themselves which gave him a false sense of hope that Mari was alive but one day he found out the harshness. That mari wasn’t alive, she was gone, and that everything he was doing was for nothing. He stopped bringing himself to that grave because of perhaps that event or so.<
I agree, I'd argue he's the most hetronormative out of the whole gang. He literally shown to be Mari's BF before her death and he's not shown to have any romantic advances with anyone else, no less people of his own gender. He's definitely an ally though!. . Also, yeah he'd definitely enjoy reading books!
If they get married, it would be Mari Omori Omori. It would be insanely funny if their child was named Omori Omori Omori Jr.
He remembered he is mari pushings!?
Mari Jane smoking a fat blunt
Omori Mario
Mari Tanaka maybe
Mario
I have no headcanon’d last names for them. . That said, the fanon “Suzuki” for Mari and Sunny is hilarious, given Mari’s perfectionism. . >!insert Mary Sue joke here!<
Omori doesn't have a last name I think  . Aubrey Smith (English last name, means "to strike")  . Kel Armstrong (Northern English last name, means "strong arms")  . Hero Armstrong (Same here)  . Mari Suzuki (I heard somewhere Mari's related to a name with Suzuki, but I might be wrong)  . Basil Florakis (Greek last name, means "Flower")
Especiallu if that woman is mari Seriusly tho mari is my fav charachther out of any game yet
SPOILER:. . . . . Fr, I would have never expected to love a dead character so much
>! !<
Bruh one pls use spoilers and second i am honored to see more ppl who like mari
I would stay off this sub until finishing the game
Sorry, I didn't expect people to be here if they haven't finished the game yet. Also how do I mark as a spoiler?
Its okay so there is just a spoiler option on ğc chose the lines and mark them as spoiler and in phone i have no idea sorry i usually use from phone so this is kinda embarassing so if you dont know how just wwrite spoilers at the top of your sentence that i think would work fine and thank yoi for loving mari you person woth insanely big brain
Bruh spoiler tag this shit
I'm 16 and Mari makes me feeling like a flippin' 9-year-old.
i wish i was mari
Wow I just cry looking at the pictures with Mari :(
the emote that appeared was smug mari....hm
Doggy could smell the depression (except mari, he would smell stairs)
>!spoiler tag!!< (> !) message (! <)
But what they doing here
>!Now throw mari downstairs !<
>!This take as cold as Mari 💀!<
Mari should have her own shrine, I'm not obsessed I swear (maybe just a little but idc)
‼️I LOVE MARI ‼️
Mari is a good person 
OmorixHellmari.  . . . It's called Hellmori.
Mari is dead .
>!that makes sense, along with the scene in black space showing that sunny feels like he killed her, because he killed mari and mewo was euthanized/given away because of mari's death!<
Idk Aub and kel are 17-18 , their past few years have been revolving around mari's death. Mari's death pretty much fucked them up especially Aubrey. For once they all decided to make peace with the fact that Mari was gone. They were together finally. Now to find out thaat faris( sunny) their best friend killed mari , and basil helped framed it as a suicide. It would come as a shock, even if they see faris's(sunny) and basil's pain, it would fuck them up even more. It would stick with them. Grief works weird guys, but forgiving would come much later. Later as in years later. . . With hero he's older and he doesn't show but mari's death has effected him the most. He's been in college all this while yet he had failed to make friends. He is thoughtful and understanding, like aub and kel he might not be impulsive with his reaction but how would it make you feel if your girlfriend killed herself and you have spent so much time thinking over and over what you could have done to save her,  what went wrong. And then finding out that your best friend killed the only person you couldn't have loved more and your other bestfriend covered it up as a suicide. . . Hero might try to help faris (sunny) and basil, might make him talk to his parents, try to find them some help. But idk about forgiving. This will surely fuck him up in the long run tho.
who is faris
Then again there is ample evidence for them to realize that Mari’s death is not by suicide and was somehow orchestrated.
the scene with the father cutting down the tree while saying "you are not my son" makes me think that at least the father knew that it wasn't suicide
The scene happens during a black space hole but your point still stands
Haha *orchestrated*
Funny enough, I didn't realise the pun 'til now! xD
I'm gonna cry 

nah they 100% know. a simple autopsy would reveal the actual cause of death which is nowhere close to death by hanging. mari probably had multiple bruises, broken bones, etc in places that couldn't be damaged in that way
The thing is that faraway town is a pretty small place, I don't know if the local police station would even bother with an autopsy in the first place
Would they even do an autopsy if they find such an apparent suicide?
Probably, yes. I'd imagine that falling down the stairs would leave all sorts of very visible marks on her that would look even more suspicious after being told she "committed suicide". Doctors still examine bodies for cause of death, and getting in a very battered teenage girl's body and being told "She hung herself" would raise *all sorts* of alarm bells.
>Especially the room with the rows of sick Maris. . . Wait, those are Maris? I always thought more of Basil's grandma.
I suppose it's possible. I think I thought of her before I picked up the bed photo in that room, at which point I went "oh no. Those are Mari."
>!Even that could be a product of Hero's mind just given that it's the first time he's been in that house for a while and he likely still isn't over Mari's death!<. . >!He's obviously not as worse off as Aubrey is about Mari (and certainly not Sunny and Basil) but he clearly still has some regret and confusion over it!<
there are more evidences of supernatural, it is implied that Headspace is much, much older then we though
>!Mari never seems to have gotten an autopsy or anything, which is odd given that her body would have clearly been damaged beyond self harm. Asphyxiation makes sense however as most people who aren't professionals at hanging people tend to botch the neck snapping part and end up just suffocating. But the fact that no police or medical staff ever noticed that Mari's body was clearly *sus* for a regular hanging is odd.!<
>!Yeah honestly I don't get why some people act like ghosts existing is an inherently unrealistic/fantasy thing. Regardless of whether you personally believe ghosts exist there are many people in real life who do believe in ghosts and other supernatural things, and IMO the way it's handled in Omori is actually quite "realistic" in that it's left ambiguous as to whether it's a real ghost or not, and ghost Mari doesn't do anything too fantastical. The most unbelievable thing she does is maybe appear in Sunny's dreams, and people in real life tell stories of ghosts talking to them in a dream all the time.!<. . >!Also it's entirely possible that the devs believe in ghosts, which would make ghost Mari realistic to them!<
>!Agreed. Furthermore, maybe if any of our unaswered questions about the theme had clear answers, we wouldn't be still asking them years later! I'm not complaining. We still ask them because it's what the game intended it to happen, and it shows the story deeply affected us. I really would like answers to if Mari forgave (is this a real word?) sunny. Or if his friends even did. But then the game would lose some of its uniqueness. Let's all cry together.!<
I'm not sure if you believe in Bible, however there are stories there about what we see as meaningless suffering: . . Job's misfortune, Elias' journey to the desert, Lazarus' death, Good Friday events from apostles' perspective.. . Even Jesus himself had these moments; he wept when he saw his friend Lazarus dead. When hanged on cross, he yelled "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?". . As such the only thing left for us is to hope that there is a greater meaning for all of this and that the dead have not died for eternity 😥😭. . Have a blessed day ❤️
Tbh the first one there is a evidence that I see pretty important, when you are in the piano room and talk to Mari, when hero comes he says that he heard piano music, and you weren't even close to the piano, so I am pretty sure it's Mari, and the change that has in the dreams at the beach from her usual headspace characters seems to be the real Mari interacting or something similar
Also like Mari, and they are all female names
So much that I wouldn't be surprised if he established the civilisation in his mouth primarily so he could have his insides have air conditioning
>! I think people are still wondering if Mari died from the fall or was she still alive and the hanging is what killed her !<
The photo album that contains the truth have descriptions in the game files that aren't implemented in game. The photo where Sunny pushed Mari down the stairs is titled "Photo of a murder" so that in itself pretty much confirms that she died following the fall.. . The descriptions of the next few photos mention how she looks expresionless, doesn't respond, seems asleep, etc. Again, this never made it into the game, but since its described that way by the devs in the first place I'd argue we got good evidence.
>! I think she could have been still alive and somewhat conscious, while she was hanged. Fall from stairs isn't that fatal most of the times. (Yes, I hate the thought of it) !<
Well, >!She does fall on top of a shattered violin!<
Tako-chan is potentially Abbi, the other ones I am unsure of, perhaps old names for the slime girls before they went with Molly, Medusa, and Marina.
I wouldn't call this unsolved, but more of just deeper thinking.  We do know what happened to the gang after the death of Mari, but I do wonder the futher affects the death has on other people who may have known mari even alittle bit. . . Although the main gang are Mari's friends, I like to image that outside of that group she may have talked to or have had some friends in school cause it would be abit strange for most of her friends to be 12 year olds. . . It's a bit hard to determine how a school and how others we have never seen or have been mentioned would act regarding this type of news, but I'd think that it was factor for sunny to only grow worse by this guilt that helped him cut himself off from the outside world. . . That's just a different perspective of how an incident would of affected others that we may have or never hear in the game. I would really love opinions on this though
Was Mari a ghost or not?(The version of her at parts like immediately after Blackspace)
Man this'll be tough... I love all of these characters 
they're literally the main 4 in the gang
Damn they're the Yakuza 4.
Yakuza is Omori but with mafia (totally legit)
A SELFISH DEED!
This selfish deed, is not freedom
Even if, falls down
Selfish deed is not freedom. . Can't justifyyyyyyyyy 
Almost as if they’re the four that get the most character development and thus the most attachment from the audience
The core 4 :)
Same 
Oh no, we killed off Mari again
>!get the rope!<

This was definitely an "oh wow, I can't believe this is in the game" after finishing the game for the first time. . When you're watching someone play for the first time and they go here they're like, "yay I did it!" I'm thinking to myself, "this won't age well"
it is a pretty subtle detail but hinting it with the skipping rope and after realising what it actually meant
Where is this
Orange Oasis at Arrow Cave
Dont know if I should upvote or downvote
Sidevote

Diagonal vote
Upside down vote
You Bastards!
sorry for the wait, I was really busy: [
 And the Last. Post. Votes. Were!!!!. . Mari  . 33,11% (448 Votes)  . Aubrey  . 24,76% (335 Votes)  . Hero  . 19,81% (268 Votes)  . Kel  . 11,75% (159 Votes)  . Sunny  . 10,57% (143 Votes). . ONLY THE MAIN 4 LEFT!!
Sunny sent off Mari with 143 votes💀
Can't make this up
Dang.
Oh god
Mari's going to the TLC (Tiny Loser Chamber)
welcome back! 
r/samepfp
Erm, well aktshually you cropped pfp differently. 🤓
I thought you was participating in the blackout which is why you was not here.
My fav has low public opinion 
only the big four remain I see.
Big 5
I'm going to be real here.. . What is going on?
Are you asking why Mari got voted out or...what's going on in general?. . If it's the latter, OP has been posting a poll with major Omori characters an people are supposed to vote out the one they like the least. So over the course of 10 days, only Kel, Sunny, Hero and Aubrey are left
Mari survived unscathed for 8 rounds and then immediately got voted twice in 2. F.
WHY MARI?!
People couldn't bear her smug 
No time for questions, >!get the fucking rope again!<
APOLOGIZE!! 
No. 

WHO. . WHO DID IT. . **WHO WAS THE ONE WHO DID IT**
She kinda bad tho
Lowkey surprised Mari didn't make it a bit further.. Then again, it IS really hard to choose between the RW main 4.. . At this point, I'm fine with Aubrey biting the boot. There's still Hero.
If even one of the brothers win it's a sweep honestly
Nooooooooo
I'm....I'm upset...
When are you going to post the next poll? It has been ~~4~~ 5 days...
And so what next ?
This is a tough one
NO!!!! 
And just like literally every time these "favorite character" vote poll things come around, the winner obvious from the start, being the main playable protag. These karama farms should be illegal.
I love the way every single person that says this has a different idea of the “obvious winner”
Snnuy for the win!
. . nuh uh
You could have screenshotted it
Why do people like Kel over Mari.... Smh
better character 
Noooo, Mari is a goddess, my heals 
while i do agree with your point, have you considered: 
Mari tho...
 \> 
Lol
>!I like alive people more!<
Dreamworld is Real World... Mari is goddess
agreed 
Sunungus
just like mari-
FUCK AUBERY
I am in your walls.
To hell with Arby
Hero, its time for you to reunite with Mari.
Aub.
The main four left!
NO MARIIII. . THAT'S MY NAME :((((
I'm sorry but the fact that Mari is out before Hero is unacceptable 
Aubrey. literally how did she last longer than mari
why do i even fucking bother
It was about time
Oh well  but welcome back! 
RIP Mari again lol. . rw kel
Finally
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Finally
This is where it gets though
I am so fucking pissed right now
Which one...? 
Rip Mari, you were a character of all time
I hope mari wins 
Sorry sammich man
How is mari out? . . Still voting kel
I JUST LEAVE FOR 4 DAYS AND NOW MARI IS OUT???????  HOW???????   THIS WORLD IS HORRIBLE
guys how did mari get voted out
CAPITALISM WINS
As a wise mute rock once said. Votes are fake. You have no control. (/j)
Man who could’ve seen this coming?
NOOO NOT MARI
Guys i thought 3rd time was the charm, why did this happen again again?
I NEED MY BOY TO WIN
I rly hope snuyy wins

Aurbey, nothing against her
The main 4 
One of the smiling ones
what the fuck
Freaking finally, what took so long
noooo babil whyyyy
Guys we did it again we offed Mari
I'm sorry Hero, but Mari is waiting in the next room. She has been missing your cooking for 0.00001 nanoseconds too long.
Mari is out ? No more like Mari is down
Mari has been thrown down the stairs
But they are all my favorite traumatised folks
>!You loved her, and you killed her!<
Aubery
Well… It was fun atleast!. . I wish a good game for the rest of the participants!
Oh my God! They just killed Mari!
is this to vote who we hate or love the most??
hate
When's the next poll gonna come out?
Mari x Pizza is good too
I JUST SAW THE CAKE I CANT-
Her father was a U.S. soldier and was killed in action in Gulf War a few months >!after what happened to Mari!< and this contributed a lot to what she've become. . Also I think she tried to learn Japanese to impress Mari (My headcannon is that both Mari and Sunny are Japanese descendants and fluent in)
She wants to be a teacher or have a job in childcare so she can be the same person for someone else that Mari was for her.
once every year on the anniversary of maris death, she goes to the treehouse and/or her grave and pray
She does that every day dude it’s canon
: Ugh! Can't you see, Mari?! I'm not in love with you!. . : Oh, really? You just fell asleep on my lap last night, remember?. . : ...
>!Don't worry! He's happy with Mari now!!<
Based
How the hell Mari got eliminated?
no she was named after mario yahoo
yahoo! here we go! 
>!yahoo!yahoo!yah!ya!yayayayyayaay \*falling down the fucking stairs\*!<
>!NO MARI THAT’S NOT HOW YOU DO A BACKWARDS LONG JUMP!!<
Fun fact, there’s a secret third route where >!Mari does a backwards long jump up the stairs to fight Bowser with only 16 stars!<
Pfft I did >!noose!< skip and beat the game 0 stars lol it's so easy all you need to do is glitch kel into the stairs cutscene and you can skip mari BLJing up the stairs to the bowser fight
She cant do that because she has a bad knee
mario moves are so confusing like **"backwards long jump"** jesus. . this is why sonic is better
How is that confusing . You do a long jump but move opposite of where you are facing
Nah, doing a blj is not that difficult, you just have to don a normal long jump angled backwards and keep doing it to get backwards momentum, than bump into a wall, or stairs, or a slightly steep surface and keep pushing against it to gain more negative speed. When you got enough  speed, angle it towards the direction opposite to where you want to go and zoom across the map
I see the spoilered text and I already know what’ll be there
i thought he was gonna fly at extreme speeds
Spoilers. . The snake on the stairs of Neighbor's Room alludes to Mari's death by stairs and jump rope.. . Snaley's deaths reference Mari in the following ways:. . Pluto running over Snaley - Sunny pushing Mari. . Dying on Sweetheart's stage - Mari dying before the rehearsal. . Party killing Snaley - Mari dying by the Sunny's hands. . Snaley drowning in Humphrey - Sunny almost drowning and Mari saving him, except that no one saves Snaley. . Bonus Points that when Snaley gets struck by lightning and HS Aubrey doesn't care, but FA Aubrey feels like she's the only who still cares about Mari's death. . I still don't know why Sunny made his currency clams of all things
We can safely assume Sunny and Mari is probably Asian(most likely Japanese), because even the game name itself is taken from a Japanese word. Some people think she was named after the flower marigold but it is possible for her name to be this detailed.
Could it be both? If Omocat was aware of both meanings, especially as Sunny and Mari are most likely Asian American.. . If Mari was born in America it would be a good name to pick, as it is already a name in the english language. Conveniently Marigold is a flower as well, that I believe is also called "herb of the sun". Would highlight her connection with Sunny.
Thats a nice theory. I think its all three we said.
Oh ok. I thought you were just comparing the theories.
I don't like comparing them. I prefer to believe all.
Mari is a br*ton????
it's lower brittany not britain
I hate br*tons argonians are better
I guess Mari is the final boss of Titan Souls now
I’ve always thought the name Mari was beautiful.
Is this (this info) specifically for omori? Like Mari can be written multiple different ways with diff kanji changing the meaning
Mari > Truth
Now, all that's left is the Mari plushie!

Mari. I’m sorry. I’m probably gonna get downvoted >!But if Mari wasn’t so hard on Sunny, then she would’ve never died!<
yeah but i feel like the whole point of the game is that it’s a little bit of everyone’s fault
…
Yeah, but you can’t blame that on just one thing or one person.
Tell me you didn’t understand the game without telling me you didn’t understand the game
Oh really, huh?. . >!“You did this all for her! Why was she yelling at. you? You didn't understand..” (Truth Album Datamined)!<. . >!“Your fingers were shaking in pain... practicing over and over... but you still make mistakes after. mistakes..” (Truth Album Datamined)!<. . >!“MARI was yelling at you, You couldn't understand what she was saying. She didn't understand you at all.. she didn't understand that you just weren't good enough. The orly thing you hold onto was your anger. This pain.. was it her fault?” (Truth Album Datamined)!<. . >!“Maybe I pushed you too hard. I'm sorry... I just wanted it to be perfect.” (Mari)!<. . I dunno man, it’s made *pretty clear* that it’s Mari’s fault
Completely disagree
Tbh I don't know what some people believe for Mari to have done to Sunny lmao
Mari's biggest character flaw was her struggle with perfectionism. As a result of that, a lot of players think she pressured Sunny to practice his violin as much as she practiced her piano, even though he didn't want to. Additional evidence for this is found in his alter identity of Omori, named after her piano, as though he were *envious* of the piano.
Bait
fr though 
Bruh did you just blame Mari >!for getting murdered 💀!<
Compromise, we vote Mari lmao
LET MARI WIN 
Mari
RW Mari needs to go
Any headspace character except mari
Mari's gonna win in the end I'm calling it.
DW Mari
RW Mari (she is already dead lol)
RW Mari >!(She is already dead lol)!<
Let's Kill Mari again 
Shoot down Mari. She shouldn’t be alive (The Real Mari)
How do we not have omori but we have rw mari oo
Dream mari
vote out DW Mari
I’m gotta say it…Mari 😔
More so Omori x Mari, but not in the traditional sense. I imagine Omori(not Sunny) having these thoughts as a means of coping with losing Mari. I separate the two because I see Omori as a split personality.
Disclaimer: I don't see it as a healthy relationship nor do I actually advocate for it. I just see Omori using it as an unhealthy means of coping.
i’m just saying! i don’t think two teenagers who haven’t seen each other in 4 years whose last interaction was probably at mari’s funeral should date! they probably both need to see professionals before they can date ANYONE let alone each other, but hey, what do i know lmao
He was glad Mari died
He tried to give Mari CPR first to revive her, but it didn't work. . . He then talked about burying her or dumping her somewhere, but then he and Omori decided to stage the death. . . After that he became obsessed with growing plants to distract himself from the horror of what he had done
rw mari gets how many lines compared to dw mari?
Aw, come on, Mari may not have many lines, but her memory, the things she did and etc are present through the whole story 
I know right,>! getting lines only near the end of the game.!< not enough depth
The whole damn game is built on RW Mari
I agree for different reasons
Is >!black and white!< Mari real world or dream world's?
black and white is ghost mari
Name 1 DW character that is more interesting and silly than the RW version other than Mari
Omori
Well Omori is not in the poll so... 
sPEAKing about Mari, the Bussiness Cat team, only if you want, will gladly recruit the Mari Team!! Or join you guy's team. That way Hero and Mari can be together!! And with Mewo!! Not only that, our facility has NO STAIRS AT ALL and they've been replaced by elevators!! So, only if you wish, you guys can join our team and have a better defense and offense
Got it, so just to make it official, is the Mari Team joining the Bussiness Cats?
I'll assume that yes. Welcome, Mari Team to the Bussiness Cats!
me when i'm not in a group with anyone lol
Oh nevermind then lol
Idk I saw a post where mari gang join forces with basils association
No, that post was the UBA asking for Mari Team to join them, and they didn't answer. Here the person said yes but I'm just asking 100% sure
Ooh okay okay 
if my dear sweet mari doesn’t win i’m pushing all of you down the stairs
RW MARI for reasons people who have playes the game know!
If Rw Mari gets voted out I will also cease to exist (I named myself after her)
head space mari
KILL MARI
Vote out real world, Mari >!because she’s too dead for this poll!<
Mari. >!For canon accuracy.!<
Dreamworld Mari
can we hang dw mari
Now that’s scary. Would we really want to see Mari >!get offed?!<
I’m guessing if Omori itself is going to be a central character in the story, it’ll be after the recital incident but before the events of the main game. There’s 4 years of stuff that could be covered, even if it is all just in headspace
So you're saying we should milk Mari more?. . Your words, not mine.
maybe change YOUR words..
please reread your reply and realize the mistake you just made
I mean… 😳
I’d be ok if we could keep milking her.. *don’t read that twice*
blocked. **blocked.** ***blocked.*** youre all ***blocked.*** *none* of you are free of sin
What about me?

: >! just like Mari! !<
I think it is a uniform because Mari is wearing the same outfit too. Not sure why they’re wearing those clothes in the summer when nobody else does, though. Could be they just don’t have a lot of non-school clothes since neither are very active
Yeah! Mari has it too!
It's called 'the Mari bangs'
Really
>!She's the *Mari*onette, hung up on strings!<
AYOOO
Sunny saw the animatronics and destroyed it from the back, only for Mari to appear. In panic, he wore his old clothes to deceive himself from reality. Unknown to him, spiders lived in the suit, bit him and paralyzed him. As he began suffocating in vertigo, Mari slowly disappeared.
What the heck 
The boy behind the suicide
I felt high while reading this
>!the area before The last Resort i think thats Maris actual spirit!<. . There is zero proof of this. Seeing her >!spirit!< in the rw is a fair theory, but I don't think you can see those kinds of supernatural e vents in dreams
>!neither did mari !<
> >!may have lived!<. . >!she was not breathing by the time she was placed in bed!<
>!Hero could perform CPR though, and it took time dragging the body upstairs and checking her breathing. If anything, Hero was supposed to be a doctor once he grows up, so he would have prior knowledge on what to do in this situation. Mari could've been paralyzed, therefore making her nose not able to breath, but is not dead-dead. It may have been a hallucination by Sunny, but Mari may have actually opened her eyes once she was hung, which could mean that she's still alive by that point.!<
>!The opening eyes is actually a common occurrence with hanging, the blood pressure in the head increases so much that the eyes bug out. This is one of the reasons people executed by hanging had bags over their heads. Also a snapped neck (which is my best guess as to what happened considering Mari's falling position in the truth photos) is pretty much an instant death. CPR wouldn't help as the brain is no longer able to control the rest of the body so no autonomic functions will take place such as breathing or the beating of the heart. In other words, she dead.!<
>!copium!<
Bro argue with this [
JUST CAUSE U AINT BREATHIN DONT MEAN UR DED YALL!!!
The last point I sorta agree with, but I'll just occam's razor the rest of the edge away because I'm too lazy to do any research
I mean at least ur honest-
When does the game actually say this though? Always been confused about that.
>!Didn't Mari stopped breathing while in her bed?!<
<---->!friggin murderer!<
>!He wasn't the one who killed her though. He only came up with the idea to hang her!<
>!Yeh but didnt they see mari open her eyes? Also I bet if they called medical help instead of hanging mari she mighta lived!<
>!if you're talking about when sunny looked back at the tree, that wasnt "real", I'm pretty sure it was him feeling guilty and thinking Mari could still be alive, but it does say that she was no longer breathing by the time they put her in her bed!<
Also, someone in the thread did previously mention the >!eye opening thing, and how it's a common occurrence during hanging which could also have happened with Mari 
Shadow: "*M-MARIA?!?*"
It is I.. . Luna Maria Kanzaki <3. . -Maria
Let's kill Mari :) >!again!<
Guys, we must make Mari win, preferably rw Mari! 
Yes
Nice! But you dont have to if you don’t want!
I just really like mari
Same! 
Rw mari
I hate you /hj
I see. . I wonder if Mari has a chance at winning tho. Or if she’ll be 3rd
Well, I guess that means RW Mari is next 
I don’t know what but something is telling me to vote out Mari (Faraway Mari specifically)
let us drop kick mari like sunny drop kicked mari  . (this is a joke but still vote rw mari because funny)
Give real Mari the stairs 
Get RW Mari outta here!
DW Mari, I love her but she doesn't do much
RW MARI CMON GUYS PLEASE
>!I just noticed Maris's shadow!<
What the hell
Its,,, hinting at something… hmmm . . . Obviously its the brazilian translation
actually, that already exists as a mod lol. if im not wrong, it was the first unoficial translation
>!voce have nao sister kkkkkkkkk!<
>!Vai te fudekkkkkk!<. . >!Vo te empurrar de uma escada não mexe comigo não!<

KKKKKK MLK.
We can't have a single cute art of this game oh my god
Thats a nice touch
Mari almost carrying the entire cast on her back
No wonder she has a bad ankle
*knee
[Neck*]()
God I love this fandom’s dark, absolutely pitch black humor.
FOUL
People thinking Mari is a shitty person
But there is also the other side that think that she could do no wrong.
She did
Wth no she didn’t? Hate it when people project their headcanons onto fiction. That literally never happened 😂
honestly she’s just a normal sister. kind sometimes, a snarky douche other times
mari isn't evil and isn't secretly a huge bitch she just made a mistake
The folks who say stuff like this are, like a lot of people, really uncomfortable with the idea that a character could just tragically, senselessly die when they didn't do anything wrong, so they have to invent from whole cloth reasons why they actually deserved it.
I mean I’m pretty sure this was a planned thing but was scrapped or something?. . Remember seeing posts of scrapped content where Mari abused Sunny, not sure if that was real
Mari did nothing wrong
That theory is a stretch and falls to occam's razor but is possible
Yeah, cause if >!Mari really died from the hanging!< then it destroys the entire point of the game.
Just out of curiosity, why would it ruin the point of the game?
That Mari is dead. She is alive guys, her and all her friends are having a slumber party right now 
>!That Mari is Something, it's very superficial. Something is the incarnation of the guilt and anxiety that was born at the sight of the hanged Mari.!<
this ones canon in my au because grrrr i just want everyone to be happy but yeah its totally not true in the actual game
It's kinda a misconception that i've seen going on since the very beginning, but a whole lot of people view Mari as practically "perfect" and being a literal angel amongst the rest of the crew. I'm not here to say she was a bad person, but she had her flaws like any other human being and a lot of fans seems to overlook that. I definitely wish we could have more RW Mari content because DW is just how Sunny envisioned everyone. I also feel like many people don't actually know >! why Sunny got so frustrated at Mari in the first place and what led him to push her. It can be pure speculation, but it's probably because she pressured him so much and focused solely on their duet performance and not Sunny's own feelings. !< Throughout the game it's hinted that Mari has some perfectionism issues and projects that onto Sunny. I still love Mari and she's one of my favorite characters in the game, but she has flaws like anybody else.
Que los forenses no hayan dicho nada hacerca de la verdadera muerte de mari
that's an actual ship on the OMORI Wiki. i think the shipping name is called sayomari
The more you know, I guess?
yeah
Mari- \*Sayonara plays\*
Appreciate it! From the comments in here I’m assuming there’s some Mari similarities to the game already so I’ll take your advice and just start playing the free version tonight before risking any other spoilers lol.
Keep us updated in how your experience goes!
Mari gently comes down the stairs...
🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿. >!Mari!<
Sadly wrong. But not all is lost yet! Brace yourself for: Hint \#2!. . The character is pink.
My apologies i'm afraid i don't have the answer
The answer was: Sir Maximus III. . But any member of the Maximus lineage would have been fine.
Oh wow i wouldn't thought of this one, gg
Feel bad for Sir Maximus IV... His Father, Grandfather, and Great Grandfather died all in the same day.
Oops sorry!
I was referring to >!Mirror Ghost-Mari, as the only thing that stands out is her hair!< but close enough, also spoiler
Uhhhh Hellmari
Spot on
Mari..?
Bingo
Mari
No
Damn i forgot her name, Marina?
Correct!
Bruh 🗿 Mari
Got it lol.

Nope, if you scroll on the subreddit long enough you might find the answer
you know what honestly just search up "lean" while in the subreddit lol
ye lol what made you pick Mari
Someone commented the exact same thing and it worked ig lol idk
Mari . . I have an elder sister too,except she doesnt play the piano,but she is still a Perfectionist and 3 years older than me.... . . She got 1# in a class with 70 students
Is she alive?
She's no longer with me anymore... 
>!She moved to a bigger city,and i am joining her next year,ha gotcha  !<
Bastard
Apologizes,if the joke went to far.. 
I will make sure i eat your liver🗣️🗣️
ON GOD⁉️
FR ?! NO CAP?!
Nonono, dont worry, im joking


>!Guys don't worry, she just moved away from home. Lmao get bated!<
She's no longer among us... ඞ
Mari's my favorite too!  (Aubrey and Sunny are tied at a close second). . I play the piano, am a perfectionist, and my brother is 3 years younger than me too. . The catch? I'm not a sister lol. . >!but yeah, it's kinda scary how many things I have in common with both Mari and Sunny!<
Oh my,now i am scared of myself as a younger sibling ans i will not go near stairs with my sis 
i'd be the >!one falling down the fucking stairs!<
We're both literally the same.. . Except that I have a sister that's 6 years younger than me. . >! please don't push me off the stairs !<. .  <-- (she is holding back tears)
Same here, right before Daphne >!AKA Doughie!<. . . Don't let your sister meet you know what fate.
— Mari
I'm a woman enjoyer, so this is difficult.. I'll just list three in no particular order.. . 1. Daphne. 2. Mari. 3. Mutantheart
Honestly, I agree with all of these, though I’d switch Mutantheart and Daphne’s placements.
Mari. Cause she so noice. I like her smug ass face. Probably why the floor liked it so much . . . Sidenote I like the art of that one artist, especially their Mari drawings. . . But. . I kinda am concern abt the messages the art has when with sunny
what did the artist do? am curious.
They like sunny and mari a little too much. They also like Alabama as well

💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Mari
Mari!! She's a huge inspiration for me, she helped me let go of the belief that I'm too naturally self centered and scared of having someone depend on me to be a big sister or mother figure and a nurturer!! Praiseworthy and lovable ---> 

How many people have older sisters or are an older sister with three years apart. Mari is also my favourite, she's such a peaceful person just sitting like 'hi, have some food and save at my basket'
. . I have an older sister too, but instead of her loving me growing up we fought a lot and were at each other's throats for a long time as kids. Unlike Mari, she is a pretty messy person.. . We are chill now, and I'd still give my life for her despite all that so
Mari! But aside from the main cast, Daphne/Doughie
I know I'm basic as fuck but..... . Marie
Mari
If we’re talking outside of Omori, Saria from Ocarina of Time.. . In Omori, it’s either Mari or Polly
Mari bc she plays piano! I play it as well and I love to see an in game character play an instrument :D
Mari
Mari her smile just melts my heart. i know it's just a portrait with relatively simple shaped but never has any other face melted my heart this much
Mari, even though she's dead
Mari!!!
Mari. . I always wanted a bigger sister like her to make me company in moments of anxiety, or just play cards, ect
Mari
Mari
Mari!! She's kinda relatable as an older sister of three 
Mari! My ex and I both love Marinand hero 
Personally, Mari or the Bread Twin, as a character probably Kim or Aubry
Gotta be mari 
Mari 
Mari
Mari 🎹
Mari, I wish I had a sister like her, but we are probably the same age, but yeah it’s Mari.
It's the haunted piano from Super Mario 64.
🗣️🔥🔥
would Omori be named Gibson if Mari played guitar ?
for me (and I absolutely hate jumpscares) this is nowhere near the amount of absolute fear and nightmare fuel I got the first time I saw >!hellmari!< because holy fuck the >!door jumpscare on night 1 or something!<
I completely avoided that one by chance because I thought the stairs was scary and was just like nah. Not opening. . . When I thought that I >!personally killed mari by not opening that door for a while!< I felt like a monster until I knew what really happened.
Sunny just wants to feel Mari's love but >!during Mari's last few months alive, Sunny felt like Mari loved the piano more than him, which is why Omori is named after a piano because he expects a piano to get more love than him.!<
it kinda makes sense considering he >!only started playing the violin so he could get closer to her!<
That is why he did, he just was looking for any way to spend time with her because she was glued to the piano.
That is incorrect, at least partially. He started playing the violin because he thought it would be "a rewarding hobby". Sunny only being interested in playing the violin to get close to Mari is popular fanon but there isn't any evidence for it in the game.
The reward would be sister time
"a rewarding hobby" has implications that could easily be getting to spend more time with mari as she was spending more and more time with school and the piano
Hi!
My mom plays piano a lot too, in fact,, she's a piano teacher who is incredibly passionate with her job. . . Maybe I should change my name to *YAMAHA* from now on
You managed to make me depressed with a comment.
Epic gamer moment.
Yeah I thought the same thing. Omori is black and white and named after the piano since Sunny thought Mari loved it more than him
I never thought of that
Well I saw a comment on Omori’s boss theme that actually made me think how similar he is to Mari’s piano and if you think of Mari spending so much time with her piano in the months leading up to the recital Sunny probably wished she paid that much attention to him
whoa, i never thought about his name like that.
I didn't thought about it at all and my thought process was "why the heck was piano named in honor of omori?". It was the other way around apparently lol
I mean, every piano you come across in the game having 'Omori' etched into it would kinda give it away. . Omori is the instrument company, just like Yamaha
my small brain thought it was the other way around, and i only saw two pianos with OMORI written on them: the one in the faraway church and the one >!in the blackspace, in one of the holes after you collect a key!<
>! Yfw you realize he’s dressed to look like a grand piano !<
OH MY GOD.
Wait, Omori is named after a piano?
In universe, yes, he is.. . . . Sorry for the direct link, I'm on mobile and there's no formatting options that I can see.
I didn't know that! Thanks! Also, I don't mind.
Really interesting idea. New headcanon for sure.
Now I feel miserable :'(
That... is a really depressing but probably true explanation for Omori.
This, Mari was definitely the favorite child pushed hardest to excel >! as evidenced by the father leaving after Mari's death and telling Sunny he ain't shit !<. It also makes sense that Mari and Hero would be so close, I'd bet they were both star students.
I like thinking that both loved each other dearly. . . Mari cared and protected her little brother, often going out of her way to make him feel safe and comfortable. She understood her brother was more timid and quiet, so she would always put his feelings before hers in casual situations. She didn't mind this at all.. . For the concert though, Mari got carried away. She still cared for her brother, but as the day drew closer and the pressure kept building to be perfect (something she always wanted to be because she was anxious about being seen as weak or unable to do anything), she slipped up a few times. . . She would practice non-stop, which Sunny would have to be subjected to as it was a duet (though not all of the time as they'd sometimes just practice on their own). She was too wrapped up in expectations and a desire to make it the best day ever that she neglected her and Sunny's health.. . Sunny on the other hand also adored Mari. She loved her and wanted to be by her side all of the time. She was his rock in many ways, helping him find friends and just generally being really understanding and compassionate. . . Yet, Sunny felt bad for this. He didn't think Mari deserved to constantly care for him and make sure he was being happy. He felt as though he was a burden on his sister, taking away her free time to drag her along with him. . . He also thought he could never live up to her. Everyone around her praised her for being smart, kind, outgoing and generally being a great person. Sunny was happy for her, but he'd convinced himself that everyone else saw him as inferior. He was just Mari's little brother that was weirdly quiet and a bummer, at least to him.. . This all came to the front with the concert. He was working tirelessly with an instrument that he barely cared for. All he wanted to do was spend time with his sister and now he feels as though the entire town has their expectations on him. He keeps messing up. He keeps getting hurt playing the violin. He feels as though if he makes a mistake, it'll taint Mari's reputation. It would be unfair to drag her down with him, so he just... kept... practicing.. . >!Which leads to him breaking the violin. The stress and pain was too much for him, a twelve year old, to handle. So, in an act of blind rage, he threw it.!<. . TL;DR: Mari and Sunny love each other but they're both victims of putting too much pressure on themselves.
I believe you know a video game is a success and narrative masterpiece when it inspires and allows for a theory such as yours. This story really couldn't be told through any other medium and the effect it has on it's players is something I look for and highly value in video games. . . I honestly can't remember the last time a *video game* has made me feel this way and I'm so grateful this community exists. . . . Sorry for my rant, I just really really love this game
Same here. There are plenty of stories that have made me emotional, but Omori still makes me feel sad almost a year later
Many word.
"Save"
No, but it has a big backyard, perfect for burying a body. What if an Omari AU happens?
Oh no quickly move house make sure it's the complete opposite of Sunny and Maris house!!
my older sister plays the piano and her name is an anagram of mari :’(
Shouldn’t that be obvious though? I doubt anyone, let alone Mari, would love their boyfriend more than their brother whom they have no trouble being close with.
Sunny is shown to have an extremely closed off personality, even before Mari’s death so I would guess he had trouble connecting to people or really making connections and friendships. Side note,my head cannon is that he took after his Father in this regard.. . Mari was the driving force that kept Sunny connected to his friends by organizing a lot of the meetups, though Kel and Aubrey eventually began to sort of take over this role later in life. Its not that he didnt love hanging out with them, he was just too shy and timid to be the first person to reach out, which is why he dealt with Mari’s death by shutting himself off. Its what came naturally to him.. . I know, controversial right?
They played smash bros 64 together and Mari always destroyed him
I wonder who each sibling mained… You think Mari could have mained Samus?
Mari would be a strong fox main and if she was there she would be the first to main jiggly puff in melee (or brawl? I dont remember)
Im pretty sure Jigglypuff was in Smash 64 too.
Ik but she wasn't as broken as in the sequel
Sunny mained Ness because he watched Mari play Earthbound on the SNES when he was too young to play it.  Their parents traded in the SNES and games for the N64, so he never got to actually play it himself but it’s still one of his favorite video games to this day.  He also identified with Ness as a young boy/silent protagonist, and kept maining him even though he never once actually beat Mari after she’d found her own main (probably Fox).
And it makes sense he relates as they are both kids that >!have to directly confront the embodiment of trauma at the end of their respective games.!<
Mari does not obey the concept of gravity
Do you believe in gravity. . No
>!Then how'd she fall down the stairs?!<
>!what they mean Is: now that she's a ghost, she can fly!< 
Sunny and mari’s parents are always at work, leaving Mari to take care of sunny. However, Mari is always either. At school, practicing piano, or watching over the whole friend group. Sunny decides to ask mari if he can practice with her for her final recital before college.  It doesn’t work out very well for him, skyrocketing expectations.
Mari was Sunny’s mother figure because of how much she looked after him and when she died his mom didn’t know how to connect with him the same way Mari did
Anyway I can see Mari getting along well with Maya, they both are up beat and fun-loving individuals who have to set an example to their siblings, but they are a bit too keen on keeping their flaws from others, including their close ones.
And they both are best shipped with the older brother
Yeah, who would want to have >!a minor dating an adult?!<
Yeah TatsuJun and TatsuLisa are disgusting examples of that
It wasn’t perfect. They had fights. It was stated multiple times that Mari was flawed, so I assume so is their relationship. Mari isn’t the amazing perfect drop of sunshine in the world, she’s a human, and so is Sunny.
Mari is the supportive, out going, extroverted sister who’s always trying to include her shy, introverted brother. But she understands his limits and won’t push him too far outside his comfort zone and leaves him be when necessary.
I have two.. •Mari would probably be the type of person to fuss over Sunny wearing a coat like a mom would, makes him wear a sweater, mittens, hat, and scarf too just in case. Can’t forget the fuzzy socks with boots, oh and ear warmers!. •They have movie/game nights every Saturday. Mari always made sure snacks were ready, and let Sunny pick the movies. He always falls asleep on the second to third movie though, Mari tucks him in bed as soon as she notices.
Ghost Mari
Sunny was incredibly attached to Mari and in school when he would miss her, he would mindlessly doodle depictions of her on his desk or schoolwork (i got this idea from blackspace 2 where a poorly drawn mari can be seen alongside what can be assumed to be childhood scribbles) . . If Mari were to go to college, they would spend a long time on the phone with each other mostly rambling about their days. at first, it was whiplash to sunny, he was never good at communicating vocally but he grows more and more used to it as times go on, pushing through the knee-jerk reaction of being depressed that Mari isn't \*physically\* there in his day-to-day life anymore.. . Sunny and Mari grew up in a rural, snowy area, quite far away from other children their age in a small house on a hill. this meant that outside of school, they were joined at the hip for a very large amount of their childhood before they moved to faraway and met Hero and Kel. This explains them sharing friends (very uncommon for siblings with an age gap like Sunny and Mari's) and us never seeing Mari with people her age apart from Hero, who's implied to have his own friends in college (enough to get invited to parties). I think Hero was a lucky exception for Mari and she just never connected to people her age as much as normal teenagers do. . . Mari was pushed into softball by their parents in an attempt to get her into an activity outside of school, she didnt particularly dislike it but wasnt distraught she had to quit due to something completely outside her control. part of why she focused so hard on the piano and duet was to direct her energy into a new outlet to make her parents, herself, and her friends proud
Either Mari's bra or a reference to female Omor
Or a reference to omoriboy
Please don’t remind me
I can tell that you were not amused by that
Omoriboy? I'm concerned yet intrigued
That name is used by a significant portion of the community to refer to the original Omori character Omocat used for images and comics, who is older than game Omori and is more like a stereotypical shut-in. The caption of the very first image of him summarises him pretty well: "im omori and i fap and play old games".
I was not prepared for that at all
ain't that a very relatable quote
Such an accurate description
It is concerning
i was amused by that
Three options, 1.mari’s bra 2.female omori bra 3.

This sub broke my brain and now every time I see this I hear the vine boom sound effect.
is that you are blessed in the ways of the internet
. . now your ear drums are nonexistent
I’ll do you however many this is better.. . 


You broke my brain now too, congratulations.
4. His mom's

Possibly it's Mari's bra
I mean... just look at Marina's design. It's pretty revealing, and supposing she was made up on his mind, I don't think the bra is such a big deal
I imagine the drawings are supposed to be his perception of living as a hikki >!after Mari's death!<. . So.. that bra is probably his mom's from doing laundry.
People are talking about Mari but could be his mother's
Nah, I can confirm it’s not his mother’s
dw about it, my man finally found happiness ;). . or it's supposed to be Mari's... idk

maybe to show how much Aubrey has a crush on Omori, or if you think about it, Mari is Omori/Sunny's sister, and they live in the same house so, maybe that's there because Mari forgot to take it after a bath or something.
I would say mari but then again why would she just leave that there when she’s not showering so
There’s the moon in the background so its probably outside, and judging by the shirt and socks it’s probably just drying after being washed
Maybe it’s Mari’s?
omoriboy? or mari-
Opção 1: sutiã da Mari opção 2: é do Omori feminino opção 3: o Omori gosta de usar sutiã nas horas vagas
You guys are ding-dongs that’s Tako-Chan’s bra,  I believe Tako chan was present in the Omori Boy comics and if not you can find some drawings of her in the sketch book on the omori website, Tako kinda served as an imaginary friend to Omori. Also SOMEONE in this comment section said it could be Mari’s bra, dude that’s gross Mari’s his sister and although it’s just a dream, it’d still be really weird for him to have it considering that it’s a world where he can do just about anything and logic doesn’t really exist sooooooooo
It's red, a color associated with the truth, so maybe it's mari's
Isn’t it maris?
i hope u saved at mari's 😭
On Mari's headstone, it says 'the sun shone brighter when she was here'
but mari is there tho
>! Aubrey dyed her hair after Mari’s passing so This picture is not canon !<
>! I think Aubrey mentioned that she was still going to dye her hair pink because mari thinks it looks good on her and the only thing stoping her is her father (I think her father will still leave her w/o Maris death) so I think this is just an alternate universe where mari dint die !<
yeah and i think if you look real close>! Mari's hair might be purple!<
ye
ye
ye\~
yeyeye
ye!
Not only that but you can see a purple tint on Mari's hair.
Maybe maris dad dint allowed full colored hair
Your spoiler tag does not appear to have worked.
>!isnt mari's hair purple though? Might be art of if she lived!<
ye
I mean, she planned on doing it anyway, so it would make sense in a world where mari was alive
true true
>!also they were both going to dye their hair together, so maris hair should be purple if aubreys is pink. that's also why all the headspace mfs are purple haired, like mari was going to dye hers. I think that's also why neither omori not basil's dream forms are purple hair, they caused maris death!<
Aaaa sorry, I’ll edit it rn. Ty for mentioning it
what happened here?
Probably mentioned spoilers related to >!Mari!<
oh ok
*that sadly this* *~~universe was never meant to be?~~*. . or >!the incidents in the game regarding mari's death!<. . or what else?. . just in general?
Both.
oh o nice
Hello Man :)
hello exel ;)
happy christmas Man!! :)
Have a Mari Christmas and happy new Kel, :D
:D :). . XD. . have a good time pal.
you too! :D
thank you!
OHOHOHOHOHOHOHO
This is one hell of an AU. I mean it’s official art, but >!Mari being there is really strange!<
agreed
mari's literally in this picture. but all of them look 16, so maybe. this can be a drawing that looks very similar to omori's art style and its just an au where mari didnt die. and basil's not traumatized.
plot twist: mari didn't die, she fell asleep on the stairs and she landed on a soft bed.
if only 😔. . was looking thru my posts since ive barely used reddit in a while, and this comment was right at the bottom. cant believe i never responded. . . well here we are
but mari is alive, how would that be?
maybe but there is looking slightly purple - it could be tho cus no obe else is interacring with them
I think he is fazed. He looks away when Something appears, but HellMari makes him freeze in place, which also forces us to look at her longer.
I kinda expected it when I first played because I got the mirror jumpscare in headspace somewhere before "Mari" knocked on the door
Sucks to be Hellmari.. . 
She can’t go into metamorphosis
. . She can't into space either.
Well I do think Sunny himself is acting neutral, even if he is an unreliable narrator that wouldn't really be connected to how he carries himself at all.. . No it's more likely, he's suppressing his emotions, and as we saw at the end of omori, he starts crying + is able to show a more serious expression when he appears in Basil's room to tell his friends what he did.. . It's also why we only really see him emote in times of extreme emotion, ie almost any time he's alone with basil, the phobia sequences.. . Something isn't a representation of Sunny's fear, it's a representation of his guilt towards Mari's death which is why Something is held back for so long, but on the omori route he is no longer holding back that guilt, instead it manifests as a hallucination representing that he is still holding the guilt. The omori route ending is the best possible example of showing this, as Sunny gets in the car Something folllows behind him, representing his trauma being unresolved.. . Also remember that Sunny's "fears" aren't really fears towards the thing in question, but more so because those fears were things that Sunny himself associates with Mari, he's not scared of these things because he's scared of them, he's scared of them because they remind him of Mari, because Mari helped him deal with these fears initially, like especially the fear of the water, he was saved by Mari, so he associates the water with his trauma of Mari's death
Year 1 Post-Mari must've been Hell.. . Year 4 kinda tapers off.
i played omori years ago and STILL have nightmares of hellmari. love the game but it seriously traumatized me 🫩
I only had nightmares about Mari bidding farewell to sunny as spirit Mari. That made me so fucking sad
why should he be unfazed by hellmari? and either way, he does look unfazed (im actually joking about how badly you worded your tittle)
I know 😂
He's scared of spiders,pretty sure hellmari would scared him to the point of shitting his pants
Eh true true
Good thing he's wearing shorts, then.
Hes hallucinating tho, he sees the microwave and fridge working just so he can maybe swallow the steak at least. Probably hallucinated hellmari later on when "Mari" knocked on the door
Nah it was a combination of evil spirits and hallucinations. . 
The versions of Mari we see in the Red Maze freak me out more than Hellmari
"Mari can you fuck off it's been 4 years get over it🫩"
damn he's paler than ghost mari
and summoned Mari
Having Mari to say she's proud of you is 100% a core memory
 I'm telling Mari
 I support it!
 hehe animal people
 I may also be a furry myself heh…
 you weren’t supposed to tell Mari.
 oh
this went from 0 to 100 real quick
 money
What does your fursona look like?
A fox!

Oh no what did I start when I wrote this comment
Sunny and Mari are now canonically furries because kel exists
:she is dead
*...However, being in possession of a Death Note comes with a price.. . *You said you missed Mari huh? Guess who's the owner of that Death Note...
Mari is still alive that was a dummy she made to fake her death to test the emotional connection her friends had with her.
*The ultimate troll*
>!mari comes back to life!<
Mari: I'm still alive
*She is back* >!\*(from dead)\*!< *after so long*. .

Mari dead.
No big surprise
Is there a plushie of Mari?
. . yeah that’s her her hair is just hidden but she’s my favorite she’s just so cute as a plush 
Marile


Yeah I see it hanging around
You did not 💀
You silly goose 💀
Mari because you know what you can do to them right
...I would not describe that as a plus
I mean as in throw them down a flight of stairs
Mari's colors are so nice and her outfit is cute. I have been waiting so long to buy one
Mari, because we can >!*freakin' throw her downstairs*!< without any issues! =D
Mari, I have a friend who basically is irl Mari, but they live very far away, so it's like I have a mini them I can keep close
Mari because hers is adorable
Mari plush because yes
MARII💗💗
Mari, because she's the only one I have currently
Mari… we can play near the stairs
Mari
Mari because, you know, she's Mari 
my favorite is mari because i want to put her in a jar
Ah, of course. Jars are a great way to preserve food for later.
I put mari in a glass jar.
Probably the Mari plush  . because she's my favourite character
Marie! I like to toss he around. >!I find her on the bottom of my stairs and on a tree often but idk why🤔!<
Bro no matter how many times I see HellMari, I still get either jumpscared by her or get those weird chills  I just can’t get used to how distorted and creepy they made her look
Idk I think she looks adorable
Sunny. I relate to him a lot for so many reasons. I also really like Basil and Mari, I wish I had a sibling like Mari in my life as the sibling I currently have isn't very nice to me.
same
Hellmari. . Just look at her 
Mari. It’s honestly scary to me how much I can relate to her.

It's not bad but for exemple, here mari calls omori "tetro" which is (probably) the translation of gloomy but in italian I'd never use tetro refferd to a person, the translation is good, the adaptation is a bit off but it's standard with indie games
Ahh, good to know!

Keep it like that, italian Mari. 
I'm sure that's just Mari being Mari

Since when was mari Italian
Mari has reached her true form mario
the one who truly died, but everyone in the game including mari just had a dementia moment and forgor who he was
Ah, i see.
Mari, I’m guessing

Perfection is overrated. >!just ask Mari!<

omg, i never realized the first part
Just to clear this up because this caused a heated discussion: I meant at least 50% because if I said any higher I might’ve hurt the feelings of people who like this theory and want them to be happy because it’s a valid theory. You are correct, it is a really big stretch for me personally as well, and I’d more realistically say 75% is true joy and 25% would be faking it (mostly around the time of Mari’s death I presume). . &#x200B;. . Also your argument is civil because you tagged me instead of using he/him or she/her . Thank you \^\^ (Not to say the other person isn’t having a point for doing so, but I really appreciate people who don’t jump to conclusions)
hey sibling. I kinda misinterpreted your comment on purpose for humorous effect, cool that you don't take any offense. tbf I agree with your statement, >50% is quite open and even though math doesn't really work in these terms I totally get what you mean. I reacted to the pronoun use as well lol. but no biggie, I think it's fun discussing these theories and also poking a bit of fun at each other for how we formulate things. have a good one 
You too, glad you managed to find some light from an answer. It is funny when you see it as a joke. 
It's an interpretation of his character, but I prefer to think that he moved on better than the others, which helped him keep his energetic personality, even if he still misses Mari and his friends a lot.
>!I personally think it's a 'fake it till you make it' moment. When Mari died he was as sad as everyone else but put on a happy facade. Eventually (like, 1-2 years?) once he did it long enough he genuinely became happy.!<
I actually kinda believe that
It's also true that Kel (I think) is in a slightly better situation than the others.. . >!Sunny and Basil are directly involved in Mari's death, so it's harder for them to turn the page because they hide a big secret and can't feel free.!<. . Hero has a lot of pressure on him from his parents, who want him to become a doctor, and the fact that Mari was his girlfriend and he thought she had committed suicide has to make him feel like a terrible boyfriend. Surely Hero thinks that he is someone that Mari would not trust to tell him about her feelings. . . Aubrey's father abandoned, her mother doesn't even clean the house or care about her daughter, her situation is terrible.... . I'm not saying that Kel doesn't have any problem, I just think that he has the situation a little better than the others.
It's up to interpretation, the subtext is there, but it's definitely not canon.. . >!The way he really tries to avoid talking about either Mari or his family situation unless he has to very much felt like he's putting on an act. I do think most of his happiness is genuine, but at the same time, I don't think he's really let himself process his grief properly either.!<
Kel and Mari have never been shown to be particularly close to each other. Doesn't mean that he never cared about her, but compared to Hero or Sunny who were far closer to her, it'd be natural for him to get over her death much faster.
Yes, perhaps to forget Mari’s death
He isnt faking happiness, he is genuinely happy, he just overcame Mari's death faster
Ur not wrong Mari
Yes, hero is Henry, sunny is sunshine and Mari is Mario
mario
Mari's full name is Martholemew
Mari... What to say about Mari?. . Mari is the best sister Sunny could ask for. She has Her flaws yes, but I think that's what makes Her such a great character. Unfortunately we can't see much beyond the "good side" of Her.!
I like to think Sweetheart is her bad side, or more specifically Sunny projected all her bad traits onto someone he could beat but was not Mari.. . HS Mari is perfect and without flaw (Because >!Sunny can't consciously conceptualise her as a flawed person after what happened to her!<), but those flaws *have* to go somewhere however because no one can take *no* Umbridge with their family, much less their seemingly perfect older sibling.. . So he projected the parts of his sister that he hated (>!Perfectionism, egoism, seemingly nothing ever being enough and callous put-downs!<) onto a totally unrelated and exaggerated villain that suspiciously is also *very* into Hero. Thus he can have his perfect Sister and satisfaction in getting vengeance on someone who is *really* annoying.
...never thought of this, yet it makes a lot of sense.
if you haven’t posted this as a new thread you totally should. I fully accept this as canon now. you’ve convinced me.
It also makes sense, but what would that make PerfectHeart?
I don't know about PerfectHeart, but by what I've recollevted from random comments, she's just Sweetheart, but without the flaws. She's kind and selfless. . She's Idealized Perfect Mari. . Again, I don't know if that's actually how Perfectheart is, just what I've seen people say when talking about her, but the comparison is even better with the existance of a perfect version
This is a really good theory
>!It makes sense, there must have been a reason for why a fight between the two happened!<. . Also sweetheart likes Hero. . And Mari is never there, nor she knows about that, probably this is Sunny being unable to imagine the 2 interracting with each others in this scenario. . And maybe her relationship with Spaceboy might hint all Mari's negative traits that she might had even in the relationship with Hero, maybe they had lots of fights. I don't think Spaceboy rapresents Hero but I think he's like a dummy that can be used to show Mari's negative traits in relationship in general
Dude this is so smart!
This is actually really interesting
I agree
I keep hearing this same theory but with no emphasis on it but thank you so much it adds a bit more context now and clarity
>Unfortunately we can't see much beyond the "good side" of Her. . This is the most interesting part of her. We don't know the actual Mari, only her idealized version - loving sister, a great friend, and very . But unlike the other friends, we never get to see her actual character and her nuances. Heck, the only reason we know for sure she's perfectionist is because spooky Mari told us
To be fair, there's a couple times in the real world photo album descriptions where her perfectionism is hinted at, where Basil says Mari's flower crown is "perfect, right?  If only she thought so too." and the picture of her being shy for messing up some keystrokes on the piano, but still yeah, those are only hints.
If you operate on the assumption that you run into >!Mari's ghost!< a few times (2 days left at the start of the Last Resort arc; in the piano room in the middle of the night), we've technically met her, but it's at her best, most forgiving state, and only for a few minutes.  We only get little hints of the rounded, imperfect person she had to have been.
The Mari lives AU’s are always a good place to explore those faults.
Personally i really like broken harmony
Is there a link I can read that? Sounds interesting
it's on ao3
Never heard that before
That's what I'm saying!
I think it's on purpose, because whenever someone near dies, you always look back on them fondly, thinking of the great times had. The way that we aren't shown Mari's flaws is accurate to how we would perceive a lost loved one. Flawless and the best (relationship) anyone could've asked for.
Personally I think that the reason we only see the good parts of Mari is because Sunny misses her, and when you miss someone you tend to only focus on the good side of them.
Yes, it's exactly that.
My guy, are you trying to make a religion of "Her"?
?
The capital H
Ah yes, finally someone else noticed!. . Yes, I capitalize the pronouns of Sunny, Mari and Aubrey (I don't remember if I capitalize any others) It's just an "easter egg" for the onlookers like you.. . . (Edit: I do with Omori too)
I was just scared you might start a religion
Perhaps it's too late for that.
I am an outlier who dislikes her.
Ok, no problem. Good for you.
Sorry, was just sharing my 10c on her, since we're discussing Marie.
Again, no problem. (And if you're in doubt, no, I didn't downvoted your comment)
Oh it's ok, I didn't downvote anyone either.

She makes my heart hurt, being a big sister myself. I love my two little brothers so, so much. Honestly, >! When she appears as Something in Black Space and says "Sunny, I love you" over and over, I just stayed in that room for a while. I listened to the music, watching to collage of Mari and Sunny float by, Something behind me, and for the first time in the playthrough I just about cried. Because if I were Mari, I'd still love my little brothers. I'd say the same. !<
God thats so sweet
Maybe one day you can get your brothers to play Omori
So they can >!take turns shoving me down the stairs? !< Nah, I'm good.
Your two brothers must be  and 
Well that took a dark turn real quick
Moving on is a simple thing but it leaves behind a difficult deed of acceptance
You haven't spoken to your brother's in ages...

The game omori is a coping mechanism of your brain to "remember" the truth of how your family betrayed you

I have a younger brother and I really don't want him feeling sad because of a main character murdering his sister

Weak neck

Rolled a nat 1 on the landing
I just finished the game guys plz 😭😭
should have upgraded neck stats
Should have gotten better
Should have leveled up more to tank the damage


But didn’t she >!get impaled on the shards of thr violin!<
>!I'm pretty sure it was a broken neck, she fell down headfirst and that's the only plausible way I think they could have gotten away with it, even if his parents knew and covered it up. Also you might want to put a spoiler tag on that.!<
>!actually yeah now that i think about it, i remember hearing something about people dead from hanging dying by their neck being broken, so if she died from a broken neck, an autopsy might still fully look like she committed suicide!<
>!Yeah, that's what I was saying. It's called the hangman's fracture and is characterized by a break in the C2 vertebra and a dislocation in the C3 vertebra. Granted, the hangman's fracture is rather rare when not caused by a hanging. However, if you allow me to put my tin foil hat on, this fracture is caused by the head being snapped up and back. As such, I think it might be possible if she hit her chin while falling feet first. In the fourth photo of the truth album she's falling head first with her back to the floor, so she might have tumbled over and been hit that way. This is all just wild speculation though, there's next to no evidence supporting the idea that this is what happened.!<
I did put a spoiler tag on it
I'm dumb, I clicked on it then forgot.
bro. 💀
She seems like a great person to be around. Sure, her perfectionism may be irritating at times, but she's still nice. >!If only she was here... !<
rekt
the best girl with the best smug but a little bit perfectionist
This is a common theme with the characters within Omori. There's a lot that's implied than outright stated. . . With Mari, we see her as a great and supportive sister, but she was also a perfectionist. The game never gets into details as to why she's a perfectionist, but it's clear that before >!she passed!<, she was preparing for her future at college. It obvious to me that she had a lot of pressure on her shoulders, but if makes me wonder if some of that was from her parents or herself.
she just like me fr 🙏🙏🙏  a great role model! 👌🤘🤘 i want to follow in her steps!👍👍😽 she really inspires me to start climbing the stairs to success 😸😸!!!
NO YOU DID NOT
Good idea!

Eh. Around the end of the game I realized she fell off.
 i am 10 miles away
: I am 7 miles away
: I am 5 miles away
"She's Something Alright!"
**Competition**
 nope, I'm with Mari. There is no competition
a good character,. a bit of a perfectionistist, but that adds character development to her, and gives her some depth
She reminds me a lot of a really close friend of mine, . >!which made the impact of her death and how it affected the friend group hit harder than any other character’s death I’ve experienced in a story prior to OMORI.!<
Despite a few flaws in her character >!(perfectionism, per example)!< She still seems like a really nice person, caring about her friends and family. ~~Comfort character.~~
She's very pretty 
 🪦
Dream world Mari is who I wanna be, she's so nice and sweet
Best girl and best character
 Smug/10
That image is looking kinda sus tho ngl

 indeed
I think she's great! She's my second favorite. She's so nice and forgiving, she's a great friend and a great (albeit flawed, but still great) sister
Stop
She did not have enough screen time for me to form an opinion about her.
I really like Mari! She's an all around good person!  . . . but her flaw is perfectionism, which proved to be rather significant later on
>!Perfectionism is usually something most people overlook as a character flaw in most media. I think the fact that Mar's death is ultimately caused by her own perfectionism is very interesting, and suprisingly relatable. (At least to me anyways)!<. . Otherwise, she's my second favorite character, second only to Aub . From what we see in the game, she seems so genuinely caring, it's very nice.
Mari! 

. God i wish there was a save gif bot

i like her 
Can she play that one about falling down the stairs?
shameful sure thing johnny
A good sister with good intentions who pushed a little too hard

Why did she try to block Sunny Mari is an idiot
Hot take here:. She's just a plot device to me can't really care about her.. Time to cause hate
I mean you did so. . Maybe she’s just too wholesome for me but I rlly like her
Should be a Italian plumber with a letter “o” at the end of her name
How I wish I could send images here
Serious answer: No clue. Although there are hints to what she’s like, Sunny’s essentially the storyteller here, giving us the version of Mari he *prefers*. At best, he’s unreliable, but at worst, he’s exaggerating traits through guilt. The most we know for certain from what I remember is that she’s kind of a perfectionist. Beyond that, she’s possibly Hero’s girlfriend (officially or unofficially) and often the “mom friend” of the group. All in all, we know enough to understand her significance, but we don’t know a lot of specific or concrete ideas.. . Joke answer: she left me hanging on a high five, 4 out of Kel
She's one of my favorite characters. I know she doesn't even have that much screentime, but sonething about her is just so sweet and comforting.. . >!Which is ironic considering the darker parts of Headspace!<
My Opinion on Mari, she reminds me of my older sisters. >!except for the whole dying part because their younger brother accidentally pushed them down the stairs.!< So she is obviously a great character in my eyes.
Mar 
I wanna be Mari and/or date Mari
What make you think I'm not
Coward
She seem like she would be fun to hang out with
Fucking amazing. . /10
She has great personality in my opinion. She is outgoing, open-minded (literally depicted in BS), play sports, play instruments, and always up to trying new things. In my opionion, she is a great friend to be around and the type of person that always inspires others. Those are traits that made Mari a great sister of Sunny. . . Of course she has her own trouble, including obsession of details making her a perfectionist. Little are known about her darker side as she would be type of person very aware of her impression around others. However the game implies Hero somehow is very close to her, so i assume they share lots of stuff together. Im sure Mari might made many friends in school as well, but the game didnt show much in that context.
i am so in love with her
Wholesome and carring about them l really like that character.
Best girl
i like her official art
Even though she made mistakes, still she's the best girl (as well as Polly)
i envy her, and not only because she >!died!<
Funky 
Mommy
mari is love mari is life
Mari is the least interesting character out of the main 6. She is only really interesting because of her death. She may be seen as a perfect person, but you know who else has that trait? ~~MY MOM!!!~~ Hero, but his perfectionist trait is done more interestingly. Hero in general should have some more exploration, but he is slightly more interesting than Mari.
I think Mari is way more interesting than Hero simply because >!we don't see or hear about Mari as much. We are given vague details about her and are left to fill in the blanks. There's this sorrowful mystery that surrounds her character that the player gets to piece together in their own way. Obviously she isn't without a personality, but discussions about Mari are always so much more interesting because we can go deep into our own interpretations of her.!<. . Hero just makes me go  , I don't hate the guy, but he's kinda forgettable.
I know this is an ancient comment but, Hero IS inherently perfect. He doesn't have to try as hard as anyone around him because his luck and charisma are maxed.  In contrast, Mari does have to try. Given the limited exposition we get (like the softball injury & her shyness in making inconsequential mistakes), we can infer that she tries extremely hard to achieve the level of 'perfect' that she does. Rather, she tries too hard and exerts too much effort into her endeavors. It's the part that ultimately caused her death, even if she felt she was doing it for Sunny's wellbeing. 
She's not very >!stair!<ble
I can't have thoughts about myself!. . But Mari is cool. They're basically me, except age, gender, hairstyle, and dresstyle. Yes, we have the same name.
. . this
not very durable tbg
easy to guess if you check my post and comment history
Mari is a loving big sister, a good role model, a forgiving person, she’s practically perfect.. . What scares me about her is that she reminds me WAY too much of my own sister. Even the real 8-bit version of her looks like a slimmer and slightly more asian version of her. It’s terrifying.
Oh I hate her /j
Yes
Best girl.
She gives me gender . . - a nonbinary person(aka me)
so true
I really think nothing of Mari at all...I don't really think of character just her in association with Basil and Sunny and the accident. 😬
I think she's into pegging
My thoughts are that posts like this are dumb
Low effort post
>! I'd say this video perfectly describes my opinion on her well enough  !<
>!I wouldn't say she was fridged. Take the list of criteria at the beginning of the video.!<. . * >!A character death that happens only to upset a more important character!<. * >!Fridgings are plot devices that don't get the same exploration, depth, or gravitas as a major character death would be given!<. * >!Mostly afflicts secondary characters or characters the writer considers broadly unimportant to the story!<. . >!The first point is absolutely fulfilled, I'll give you that. However, the second and third criteria are absolutely not the case. Mari's death was given an immense amount of gravitas and depth, and it was naturally explored extensively as the linchpin of the story. They also say "while fridging is intended solely to upset another character, well-written character deaths almost always upset the other characters too - and since the character themself is usually too dead to care, most of the lingering ramifications of her death only affect the other characters, typically by upsetting them... the key difference is a fridging usually makes the other characters upset briefly and shallowly, while a solid character death makes the other characters grieve." Omori is literally all about the grief and guilt Sunny and the rest of the friend group feel over Mari's death. This isn't fridging.!<
she's nice and sweet but i wish she changed her opinion on trans people
I LOVE HER SHE'S SO COOL AND SWEET
Perfect.

She's dead.
Best girl no question!. #fight me!
She the staircase to heaven!❤️
Best caracter,mari supremecy
Mari
smash.. literally
I’m sad
A good and talented older sister.
She is my favorite character simply because she shares the name of a lost friend.
Kinda underwhelming. The only we thing we know about her is that she's a caring person and a perfectionist. Kinda wish she's more than that.
Ps: pls tell me if I'm wrong but sometimes I low-key feel like she's a bit a narcissist or egotistic.
Something, something, dead sister.
I really like mari, her charecter from what we see of her is very caring and loving towards sunny and the entire friend group and she acts as the perfect catalyst to the events of what we see in the game


She's my favourite character and personally someone I look up to. To be so forgiving and caring for her friends and family even after death. I wish i could've seen more Mari content lol, she's just wholesome (and snarky!) to be around in general
I didn’t trust her at all during my first playthrough. I thought >!she was the one responsible for Basil going missing and even thought that she purposefully threw Sunny’s violin down the stairs (until I wiki searched the description of the photos). Hell I was even suspicious of her following the party around with her picnics haha. My encounters with Helmari (especially the first one) really solidified my distrust too. After playing the game I felt bad for doubting her though, she’s a good sister!<. . Edit because I used the discord censor instead of the Reddit one
Mari kinnie here. Love her
Gravity doesn't like her so it teamed up with stairs to make Mari become Neymar
Denmark
shes seems like a cool person to hang out with
The pizza wasn’t there…
I like her a lot, too bad she has a bad knee
Hard to say because we the player never actually interact with her while she's alive. Most we get is the idealized perfect version of her in headspace when apparently she's flawed as any other human being.
👍

mari is cute in this picture
She's good but her character needed a little push to become my favorite.
MEEEEEE FRRRRR
Dead
She's ... something
She's wholesome
Fuck that bitch ain't wanna dance, scuse my French but I'm in France
Bro spittin straight bars.
Get a restraining order immediately
ayo the pizza here 
I really want her to be my sister
i see mari, i upvote because it is mari
Fear
Dead
Personally for me, she’s a blank canvas!. . All we really know about her is that she was a perfectionist and she loved her brother. I think she was a bit pressured to be perfect, because Mari is said to be a mature person but she is still a kid which is why she has a temper when things go south. Being the older sister and having so many achievements at a young age put Mari’s expectations off the charts because all eyes are on her. She doesn’t want Sunny to be left out or feel unworthy of being her brother and that’s why they were always together no matter what. But still, whatever Sunny’s view of her is what we know her as, a flawless sister who cares for him with no imperfections who is never hurt. That’s what he wants to see, that’s what Mari wants us to see but Headspace characters are heavily exaggerated. Overall Mari is a good character but I wish we got to know her more, she’s very vague in the storyline which depending on you, is mysterious and leaves you to speculate or move on to other characters.. . Headcannon; Mari swears but only when she’s alone with no one else around not even in front of Sunny or Hero. . TLDR; Mari is awesome but i personally want more details about her 


i love her so much :[ she is very similar to me in a lot of ways and just. idk how i can properly conceptualize how much i love her. she is my everything in omori. she reminds me of someone i could have been, how things could have gone wrong. and she has a lot of flaws that i wish the game included more of (although i understand why they didn't) and she just,, she's just like me. i love her
I love her to the bottom of my heart
She's to much of a perfectionist
What I want to say about mari?. . She dead because sunny hates her, now she ghost >!and basil is suffering alot, now basil, kel, aubrey, hero, and mari- is dead, now sunny is crying alot, and alone...!<. . >!SPOILERS: this is a non-canon information(or else...?)!<
I feel like there is a lot more to Mari than meets the eye.. . I think that her perfectionism stemmed from her inability to live up to her parent's expectations of her, which is a common problem in a lot of families. I feel like she pushed herself out of fear of disappointing everyone around her. To me, I believe she had a fear of letting others down, or more specifically, a fear of failure. And because of that, she became neurotic about doing everything perfectly without an ounce of error, which is why she pushed Sunny to do perfectly in the recital as well.. . So to a degree, I feel like the parents were somewhat to blame for Mari's death, though very obliquely. Their high expectations caused a domino effect on their children, wherein>! Sunny pushes Mari down the stairs out of sheer rage!< at the circumstance he was put in and not really with Mari, since Mari was pressured heavily to be perfect at all times.. . I feel like a lot of this would have been avoided if everyone just went to fucking therapy. Hurt people hurt people, ffs. Jesus Christ.
Glass bones
>! She’s hanging in there !<
I feel like a lot of her flaws are overlooked personally, but we also aren't given much time to explore said flaws 
I think (in HS) that she's kind of simple, like her only purpose in HS is to be a checkpoint for you to save. I'm sure if you do all of the picnics when available there's more, but I feel like she's a bit 1D. In RW idk.
Mari best girl, also Mari + Hero best couple
I love Mari sm <3 I kin her!. . Top 5 favorite characters in the game !!
It'd be cool to "hang" out with her.

Everyone knows deep down she's hot but they're too nervous to admit it to everyone else.. . 10/10 Top tier queen. I wish we had more of her character in her game.
Stair
she’s an amazingly written character with a great design 10/10
 Mari is great than any character from omori
She is silly.
best character
What do I have to say about Mari?. I wish I was Hero, that should answer your question!
best girl
Eh 8/10 if I had to be chill which I wanna be I’m not a sadistic crazy person but if I had to fight her I would knock it out of the park she died to a 12 year old what chance does she have?
I WANT HER AS MY SISTER.. SHE IS BETTER THAN MY ACTUAL SISTER.. SHE AINT LIKE OTHER SISTERS. . SHE’S JUST TOO PURE.
what would he need a uniform for though if he hasn’t left the house in 4 years? probably might be Mari’s
are we not talking about headspace here?.  .  also then why is he wearing khaki pants and not Maris skirt and bow? It's his school uniform that's it.
if he hasn’t left the house, he hasn’t been to school in 4 years either so i don’t see how he would have his own uniform for a school he hasn’t attended. His mom could still have bought him own clothes so he wouldn’t have to be wearing Mari’s clothes only but he probably chooses to wear the sweater and shirt himself
exactly this has gotten silly. it's their uniforms. Mari wears a red tie at times and she wears a brown skirt. Omori wears brown cargo shorts like...this sub needs help.
... I think you realized that a little late
*Mari’s bed. . >!They shared rooms.!<
No please, I don't want to imagine Mari being abusive
i think I noticed this before without realizing it. i was looking at a i guess unused leaked photo of mari and basil, but i thought mari was omori because her hair was out of the frame and she had the same shirt as omori.. but she had eyelashes. i went and looked to see what shirt she wears and saw the shirt here, then I thought nothing else of it- I thought I was just simply wrong lmao
I always assumed this though, because his mom seemingly neglects him so he probably doesn’t have new clothes, so he wears Mari’s
I'd think he doesn't want messy hair because >!it would remind him of Mari's hair after the fall!<
Someone made a animation about this
Do you have a link?
[Here]()
RW Mari doesn't have the same hair anymore, Goku has 2
It's obviously Brazil. But fr how do you pronounce mari's name?
Check my latest post. Edit: sorry I thought you said the man, not mari
Lol. Ok
Actually Mari is not of age she is dead
Time still passes all the same, so her ***spirit*** would technically be of age. Although, if she suddenly came back to life with her body the exact same way it was before she died, then that would complicate things greatly, but since that's impossible, we don't have to worry about that.
I think with hero x mari, he meant >!before she died it was canon!<
use the spoiler thing people haven't all finished their game
ngl if you go onto a sub for a game you haven’t finished thats on you. i don’t get the whole “we must censor literally everything for the two people dumb enough to come here before finishing”. . it’s not like it’s a long game or it’s released in episodes that people may not have caught up on. i don’t go to any subs for games/shows i haven’t finished yet bc why would i
r/technicallythetruth
Tbf I’m surprised nobody tossed out a rather more sickening joke in this vein yet ;v I wonder if anyone knows what I mean? I don’t want to say it xD
corpses don't stop aging
Does this mean that since Mari's name could be pronounced as either Mari as in "Marry" or Mari as in "Mario" and since there isn't voice acting it could be either one?
Yes.
>!Mari. Dying sucks.!<
Yes.
Mari because if it’s Therapy for life then she gets life again 🧠
Wait, I forgot Mari 
If I could do anything to help, I wouldn't send them to therapy. I would become a flipin necromancer and bring Mari back
I mean, even tho Aubrey lost her father, i think that Kel needs more therapy, because he is constantly trying to be the group's ray of happiness, however, there are still some elements that show that he still feels something about Mari's events, but ""hides"" it. . Besides that I'd  give It to Brasil because, besides not having some bitches, he does not have a parental figure, for fuck sake he lives with his grandma and a "baby sitter", and guess what? The granny fucking dies. And don't even get me started on the things with Mari.
tbh the whole game could've been avoided if mari had a therapist.
i see mari is there too
As much as I love Omori, it's wildly inconstant. One minute, Mari has a brown skirt, the next a pinkish purple. Mari will have a red bow in some images & in others none. Aubrey will have more rounded hair like Mari's, the next it straight. Most images show the group has purple hair but the sprite are a bit bluesish in color. I'm defiantly not done but to end this sooner, Mari's the only one in the group besides Omori that doesn't have blush.
>res quite a few incons. . Honestly, any of those theories are possible but we can't be sure.
I mean that's Dreams world so it's fine, besides mari Is whiter yes. She's dead
Mari and stairs
Laptop, cat and mobile phone idk maybe a little funky mari too
Probably a sandbox, cat toys and Mari tho (yes, answered my own question )
hi mari plush
I'm surprised I still haven't seen any posts questioning what in the everloving fuck the meaning behind Fat Mari is. Does that room just make perfect sense to everyone except me?
you can act apon your greatest desire with a mari plush
Finally people can live out their fantasies of pouring milk on Mari and repeatedly slamming her against the wall.
💀 (mari emoji)
Mari Wings
Sounds like a type of chicken wing
Nice fun fact I was actually planning on this being the name of the band in the human world
Mariachi
Mari-go-round
THE FUCKING HELLMARI JUMPSCARES . . Fun fact: While i was in Black Space i was listening to Hol Horse's EOH theme because im a piss baby 
The weird bent neck Mari  Even looking at her without getting jumpscared is still nightmare fuel for me. Literally the reason I’m scared of playing/watching a Hikikomori playthrough because I don’t think I even want to know how much worse it can get
The first time i encountered Hellmari was when Hero and Kel were at my house . . Also, the first time we see Hellmari (when you open the door), i blinked so i didn't get to see hellmari 
luckily I didn’t see her either when the door opened then  Any deformed Mari scares the hell out of me >!including the one on the polaroid in the town area !<, she’s always depicted in such a creepy way aghh
I saw Merg go into >!red maze!< and I was screaming “GO BACK GO BACK STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP GO BACK RIGHT F*CKING NOW”
Is that the part where ppl found >!that one message in the tiles that says “Kill me”!< or am I mixing things up 
Yeah, where the toast turns into me being scarred for life
I have that as my profile for school so that it nullifies any emotion I get when seeing it
Wait that’s actually smart..
Our flairs... we need to find someone with a Medusa flair to complete the trio.
yeah first time I’ve seen a similar flair lol the girls are underrated 
Why do you like Molly? I like Marina cuz she's a feral scientist. I aspire to be that one day.
YOOOOO A JOJO FAN
LETS GO. JOJO FAN!1!!1!1
AYO JOJOS REFRENCE?
I was talking about Hell Mari jumpscer and this jumpscer is skippable
Ohh, thanks for the clarification!
The realistic Mari’s in the red space maze scared the ever loving shit out me 
Yeah, wth was with that long neck?!
red maze in general is pretty unnerving i don’t need those things tracking me down in a maze packman style get me outta here
>!For me, it's a tie between the Punishment Area (mewo room) and seeing the noose in the bathroom in the "Mari Is Home" area. (BS2)!<. . >! Edit: I forgot to mention that the Hellmari jumpscare in the Town Area scared the hell out of me, as well.!<
There’s a Hellmari there?
>!Yeah, if you knock on a specific house, Hellmari will show up for a split second instead of the doorbell ringing.!<
Which house? What day?
>!The Town Area is a room in Blackspace, and I don't remember which house it was. !<. . [The wiki page on the Town Area (spoilers)]()
Ah…
I remember that jumpscare getting me so fucking good
Idk if I'd say anything scared me in OMORI, but a lot of stuff was super unsettling and creepy, like the Mari that is standing behind Sunny in the mirror. . . ~~I did get jumpscared by the Hellmari that appears in the town area tho, despite KNOWING it was going to appear... but that's besides the point~~
Yeah there were a lot of just disturbing moments that stuck rather than jumpscares
Hell Mari.. . I could go on for hours about what that shit did to me. 
Legit a time when Mari appeared behind the fridge for a split second, I legit cried from shock
Wait, Mari can appear behind the fridge? In the real world?
For me, every times the real world scene comes I always check the mirror first cuz it the most scariest yet fun to find either nothing or >!mari long neck to come!<
THE HELL MARI JUMP SCARS
Red maze, particularly the uncanny hell Mari
Letting Mari in
>!When I was looking through the photo album and realization hit me about what really happened to Mari!<
Console exclusive content >!the end of the mari fight!<
THIS IS A SPOILER. . . . but red space terrified me, especially after all the toast changed into Mari. I actually stopped playing after for like a day or two
Every single time Hellmari shows up, makes my heart speed up tenfold
The fucking mari jumpscare at the end of her battle in bossrush, im still tramatized about it now
>!Hellmari at the door. I decided not to open the door originally but curiosity got me to reload a previous save and see what would happen...!<. . >!Lets say i spent like 5 mins cursing out the 'Nightmare Witch' as I called her while saying 'Wait till I get my gear from the colourful world, then you'll be sorry!'!<. . >!I was hoping for the longest time in the game that I'd be able to take my gear from the 'Colourful World' to the 'Nightmare House' to fight and kill Hellmari.!<
Hell Mari apparitions and the black space
My first playthrough was hikikomori and I’m telling you when I went exploring the playground after everyone had left for >!the last resort!< and when I interacted with the mirror and it asked if I wanted to play hide and seek and then “I found you!” I don’t know why but that was deeply unsettling >!also when Mari guides you there for hikikomori it for some reason creeped me out so much!<
hellmari in the mirror had me sobbing in fear
Remember that big red and Black maze in black space?. The moment when a bunch of hell Mari PNGs chases you??? My heart was POUNDING
Its actually terrifying no words can describe how scary it is
Opening the door for ‘Mari’ in the beginning. Have fuckin PTSD from that.
>!the room full of bears where you got the option to free them or not!<. . real answer would probably be >!the first time we see mari on the tree after collecting the photos (although not exactly a jumpscare but still unsettling ough) or the hellmari door in the beginning!<
That one where Hellmari chases ypu through a house
>! Mari's coffin upon first entering Black Space.  Any Hellmari really. Shit just instills a visceral primal fear.!<
fucking hellmari that shit scarred me for life i cant sleep
I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes because of it
>!Not sure about scariest, but the part that affected me the most in general, was discovering what SOMETHING is. Watching Mari hanging from the tree and transforming into the SOMETHING sprite made me take a minute to recollect myself..!<
the part of the game that got me most was the beginning of the end. When the game revealed to me the truth>! aka Mari's hanging body (in dream world)!< it had me straight up Perished.
Hellmari door and mirror junpscare
I assume you don't need spoiler tags on a post like this? Cause this is a spoiler. The scariest part for me was when I realized the truth of Mari's death, and who Something was, recontextualizing so many prior scenes that I didn't find that disturbing at the time. I think this is the only game I've ever played that got scarier the more context I had
definitely when maris coffin turned into that fucking monster thing.. scared the hell out of me.
Hellmari made me jump when I saw her for the first time
The only jumpscare that really got me was the black space Mari coffin jumpscare. The one where she turns into hellmari and there’s like a grinding/screeching noise
>!when I put the pieces together that Mari had killed herself. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts and attempts in the past so it was pretty chilling to me!<. . Edit: >!Ik Mari didn't kill herself but at one point we're led to believe that she did!<
>!When mari takes you to the area before the last resort!<
>!The first Hellmari mirror scare for sure. Not only was it scary in the moment, but left a lingering sense of unease and fear!<. . And then >!ofc the truth, but less in a jumpscare sort of way and more of “I have no idea what’s going to happen next now that I know this information. I was ready for the story to resolve emotionally… BUT NOT LIKE THIS!!!!!” Dread and panic mostly.!<. . I’m sure I’m missing the one that really got me the most, but I’ve watched like 10 people play the game so I barely recognize most things as scary. I do know that >!Blackspace wasn’t really scary to me at all… don’t exactly know why.!<
This one is a little personal for my experience. >!when I first played the game and opened the door on the first night, i looked away for a split second because I got distracted by something and didn’t see Hellmari. I also didn’t check the mirror. And then one time, I went to check the mirror and Something was there. I closed it, but accidentally pressed Z again and hellmari was there. Scared the absolute SHIT out of me, that image haunted me for months.!<
That's...really rough...
>!Mari crawling out of the coffin at OMORI toward the very end of the game.!< That's the first scene in the game that is incomparably messed up.
When I opened the door for Mari 
the only thing I got genuinely scared of was seeing hellmari in the mirror for the first time.
>!hellmari jumpscare during the Mari bossfight!<
Opening the door for mari
If we are saying play through wise I’d say the hellmari jumpscare but outside of my play through it would be the red maze
Either when >!mannequin mari is chasing you in red maze!< or >!hellmari climbing out of her coffin!<
Hellmari in the mirror
Right before >!black space!< There was this casket, from which >!Mari's ghost jumpscares you!< It also was in the latter part of the game, and it caught me off guard.
I would get incredibly tense every time I interacted with mirrors in the real world because of hellmari, I still did it anyway every time though
The whole photo segment of the truth of Mari got me real good. Like ahhhh
Look when the last photo during the truth sequence popped up I literally didn’t sleep right for two days. That’s a hard image to get out of your head and it just looks so grizzly. Also the Mari boss fight in after the boss rush got a scream out of me. I feel like most of the scares make me uncomfortable even just “ something “ it still feels like it’s staring right at me. . . . . . . Oh and Omori’s third tier sprites creep me out as well especially furious, it’s too similar to Mari’s…
Don’t. Check. All. The. Houses. In. That. One. Black space. Room.. . Realistic hellmari just popping out of nowhere 
I dunno why but putting the photoalbum back together with all the stuff about mari. I find it so...unsetteling in retrospect.
Dude.. . Hellmari at the door. 
At the beginning when you open the door and see Mari’s ghost at the door and then look in the mirror and see Mari‘s ghost in the reflection
Something in a doorway, when you look into mirror. It's very subtle, and doesn't have its "eye" drawn, so it just looks like there's Mari watching you from behind.. . Full-on Hellmari is pretty creepy, but nothing beats getting to see her normal body (in the mirror after the piano scene) with a pretty long looking neck... I believe it's also used in Hikikomori when you go to sleep; she stands before you, but on that frame you can't see anything up her shoulders, and then next shot you see is her head disfigured. Ughhh nightmare
Any section involving >!Hellmari.!<
Simple! It is her crippling self doubt of whether or not she is an indirect reason as to why >!Mari took her own life!< all whilst creating a façade of anger and unreliant trust to the gang when it comes down to the thought of them being separated once more, she is very unwilling to even bother try to give in and let that scenario even go down though deep down she still has that slight hope that everything will be okay.
That was Sunny vs Mari, and she wasn't prepared. This is Omori vs Mari
I think it would be Mari she's so strong and so beautiful no way my princess would lose
r/foundthe… idk man
Found what ?!
>!kid named gravity:!<
Can't disagree with that, sorry Omori but I'm gonna place all bets on Hikki.
Oooh mari.....how i wish i could see her one last time
Bit off topic (sorry), but I'm in the middle of a second playthrough and that hits hard. The whole game does, everything just hits . . . different, from the little things up to some of the major cutscenes.  Im not crying you're crying!
Dont worry i am crying too 
Agreed
MARI succumb’s to stairs.
Fuck you im getting in your house and im gonna push you down stairs
Easy to tie it as "omori-mari"
>!"HIKKI", Mari's version of OMORI from an AU called OMARI where Sunny dies instead of Mari!<
>!on one hand, omori has stairs!<. . >!Mari does have the market grander!<
But can she jump with rockets?
Other than the knife's backstabs/bleedout, and the probability of Mari going flying with the shovel (enchanced game), sure, the baseball bat causes fractures.
HEY DONT SAY THAT TO MY PRINCESS MARI WOULD OBVIOUSLY WIN SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL OMORI CAN'T EVE' MOVE
*OMORI used PUSH*
Sunny got Mari by surprise the first time. In a fair fight Mari would win
Hikki is older than Omori in twrms of physical age and judging by Mari's more logical thought process should be able to wield the shovel with deadly effectiveness. So Hikki under realistic physics, and Omori under Headspace physics. Headspace logic gets a bit wonky because both are technically gods in their respective Headspaces, so we should only think of how physics should work in this fight.
mari slams mid diff
I mean it depends. Sunny won one battle because he pushed her down the stairs on accident. I feel like Mari would absolutely whoop his ass if she could have fought. she seems surprisingly strong but was caught off guard. In conclusion Mari definitely would win in a physical fight
We all know who will win, omori bc if he uses the red hands Mari is fucked.
MARI
Omori Would Win Just By Pushing Mari Downstairs Like He Did In The Actual Game
Is the character on the right Mari?
Hikki (from the Omari AU)
hikki for sure, she's way too stronger and in real life mari was supposed to be way too much stronger than sunny >!however he was able to push her down the stairs as an accident mari kinda let that one slip and the consequences were big!<
where is that omari looking mf from
Omari (Her name is Hikki)
If OMORI and MARI were on stairs, then OMORI would definitely win.
i mean omari is older and has a massive ass shovel im rooting for her tbh
Omari because she is true dead inside
Well in lore we know who won but in a normal fight i'd say Omori would won because of lack of knowledge about Mari abilities
What does the omari somthing look like
Maybe Sunny won the first round, but Mari can walk through walls now, and can posses people, so Mari would win. Also, she would probably start the fight, since ghosts are trapped in earth until they kill their murderer.
I think Mari/hikki is older so they have an advantage there
Omari
Hanging Mari is not cute


Emoji >!stairs!< 



Hehe 
Spoiler?
I don't think so. It's a bit too unspecific to make sense out of context.
Deletw this or i'll give you a real big shot
Spoiler moment
WHY IS THERE NO SPOILER WARNING HERE

it’s okay, they’re divorced
My name is Mari White yo

Mari nara
I thought most people knew he named himself "Omori" because he wanted to be closer to his sister, but Mari would spend a lot of her time playing piano. . . He wanted to play with his sister, so why not name yourself after the piano she's always always playing with? Hehe
No like Mario would be. . Mari Mari. . Sunny Mari. . Hero Hero. . Kel Hero . . The oldest gets to have the name be the same . . Mario Mario. . Luigi Mario

A meme that spoilt the game (only that Mari was dead, not how she died) that I saw like 2 years prior that I somehow remembered. Even with the semi-spoiler, I got full enjoyment from Omori
a reddit comment mentioning >!mari falling down the stairs, and a cat dying!<. remembered the game 2 years later thinking that a cat dies on a staircase at some point, but it was so much more sadder than that.
the animation of mariball falling down the stairs, but I didn’t know it was a spoiler in meme form yet.
Well, at first I saw the whole dream-like shots. And then the most precious and romantically perfect character I've ever seen. A.K.A., Mari.
The worms >!pushed Mari down the stairs!<
Mari would say: "Im young!" (>!She died at a yound age please someone get this joke!<)
Yes

hammer of mari (真理)
Stairs of justice(Or Ramrod of perfecction if we going out of jokes)
Gerson solves Omori in one dream. Mari is confused about where the hell is her brother.
I see Dess as more similar to Susie than Mari. It's implied she was kind of a badass punk teenager, and Mari's a perfectionist goody two shoes. I mostly meant Noelle and Mari's sickly sweet demeanors /pos /aff. Also Susie hasn't met Dess lol
Oh I know.. . I was just talking about the *other* thing Dess and Mari have in common. :)
OH- WELL I MEAN YEAH I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN NOW
Susie: “YOU’RE NOT GONNA GET AWAY FROM US THIS TIME, KNIGHT!”. . Mari: “What..? Knight?”. . Susie: “Oh, I’m sorry. I got you mixed up with another >!dead sister.!<“
Susie is fucked. mari solos frfr
Yeah her phase 2 just seems to trip everyone up.
TRAUMA BLAST
Omori: who are you? I thought I ordered an important dead character connected to the main cast. . Gerson: I'm old!. . Knight: who are you? I thought I ordered an important dead character connected to the main cast. . Mari: I'm dead!
imagine Susie vs Hellmari
What the hell is Mari gonna do, does she just throw hands
I have a feeling mari would annoy the villagers though
She would swat that one octopus with a net
Lemme try:  . Hero: Overcooked  . Mari: Animal Crossing  . Basil: Stardew Valley  . Sunny: Unpacking  . Aubrey: Any Mario game  . Kel: League of Legends
Ok these are my headcanons:. . . . Dream World:. . Hero: Smash Bros. . Mari: Wii Sports. . Basil: Whatever his 10 year old laptop can run. . Aubrey: Animal Crossing. . Omori: CS:GO. . Kel: Minecraft. . . . Real World:. . Hero: Clash of Clans every now and then. . Mari: yeah no.. . Basil: Stardew Valley. . Aubrey: Splatoon / Mario Kart. . Sunny: Balatro, League of Legends, CS:GO, Marvel Rivals, Yandere Simulator, Overwatch, Valorant, Terraria Calamity, Dark Souls, Sekiro, Osu!, Hearts of Iron, actual fucking gambling, Elden Ring, every hentai game out there as well as Mario Kart and Splatoon only hoping he'd run into Aubrey at some point. . Kel: Fortnite
Mari and Hero would play Animal Crossing together, Basil plays Stardew Valley, Sunny plays Yume Nikki and Ib, Aubrey plays Mario Kart (and sucks at it btw) and Kel plays Minecraft and makes houses for his friends in hopes they join his server sometime
Mari would probably enjoy botw
Call of Duty for Mari.
Basil and Mari would 100% play animal Crossing tho and Hero would probably be forced to join Mari like someone else said lmao. . Mari would play Sims 4 and animal Crossing (with hero) and would be super bad at cooking mama (hero would get her to play and he'd always beat her at it) also would play legend of Zelda and Minecraft with hero.. . Basil would probably play unpacking, Stardew valley, Minecraft, the legend of Zelda, possibly sims 4, animal Crossing, dandys world (roblox), cookie run,. . Aubrey might play mouth washing, persona 5, fortnite, Danganronpa, Super smash bros, Residents of evil, cult of the lamb, Fran bow, Poppy's play time, Fran bow, Lacey horror games, . . Kel would play Minecraft, super smash bros, roblox, human fall flat, fall guys, Mario Bros, any Mario games, Pokemon, Mario cart, Donkey Kong, Wii u, sonic games, undertale, among us, five nights at Freddy's, Friday night funkin, sprunki, Lego Star Wars game, dandys world, pressure (roblox),. . (Back when they were all a group Kel and Aubrey would probably always game together and try to beat each other and be competitive. The whole group would probably play in a party in Nintendo world and Nintendo games. Mari and Basil would probably sit out on some of the games if there weren't enough spots for them all to play. They'd all play phasmophobia together too) . . Hero would play all the cooking games like people have said cooking mama, overcooked, overcooked 2, and simpler games like PAC man, Tetris, or raft, Minecraft with Mari, cookie run, legenda of Zelda with Mari, . . Sunny would play undertale, silent hill, hollow knight, little nightmares, Fran bow, Sally face, doki doki literature club, needy streamer overload, cult of the lamb, danganronpa, deltarune, bad parenting, pressure (roblox), league of legends, basically any horror games. . I'll add more to this once I remember more video games lmao but I think that's a lot. . . Mari definitely reminds me of doki doki literature club tho. I can only imagine what anime and tv shows the group would watch tho.. They might watch the squid games together or smth. (I just realized how many games ik omg I'm chronically online and cooked😭))
idk. Mario Kart?
Hero doesn't play much vidya other than animal crossing with Mari, Basil probably plays terraria (but is too scared to go into hard mode so he just fishes and plants herbs alot instead), Aubrey plays Mario Kart, Kel sweats on brawl stars and rocket league, Sunny plays Hollow Knight, Cuphead and Getting Over It because he hates himself
Sunny and Omori - Omori or Yume Nikki (hehe see what I did there?) Also maybe Undertale (Mari recommend).. . Basil - Plants Vs Zombies and Roblox Games or some Gardening Game.. . Aubrey - Danganronpa? Idk I could see her liking it. Or Angry Birds? Idk what she would play... Dress to impress on Roblox? Dancing Cats (which is just Piano Tiles but cats meow the song; I have a feeling she would want to be like Mari) and probably Tetris or Block Blast if we go by the most popular modern varient even tho Omori doesn't take place in our time.. . Mari - Doki Doki, Piano Tiles, Fnaf, Undertale (I have a feeling Mari would also like most games I listed to other characters as well) maybe the witches house or mad father? She and Sunny would I think both also like Yume Nikki (but I have a feeling Sunny would have introduced her to it).. . Hero - Minecraft? Or some random cooking game like cooking mama idk what he would like. Maybe I could see him liking things Mari likes like Fnaf or Undertale but also I don't really know.. . Kel - friv type games or bad mobile games (probably also the ones you have to dunk the random object in a trash can like a hoop, those can be fun when you are board) or Roblox with Basil.
Sunny: keneto pet. Basil: pokemon. Aubry: danganronpa:3. Hero: Surgeon simulator.. Kel: fortnight or overwatch 2. Mari: Mario party
btw, its mari, not mary💀
Man I’m dead 💀💀💀
im sorry
Which is apparently pronounced “mar-ee” (like mar, market, and mark, at least in my accent), which I only learned recently
Oop
and its black space not darkspace (im so sorry its just bothering me-)
Oh my god I'm such a fake fan
dw it only states its called black space i think once in the actual game, darkspace works too tho
no! bad! stop barrating yourself!
I definitely think it's Mari's ghost.

I'm a believer in Mari's ghost being an actual entity in the game, but [there is reason to believe that this scene in particular still could've been an illusion]()
Mari showed him how to play a little bit. You can see a scene of them during the duet.
We don't actually see him playing the piano iirc, he just has his hands over the keys. Maybe reminiscing about Mari?
isn’t this window the same window in the DW scene that happens in the fog with mari
Mari is The World confirmed. 😔
I like to think that whenever you see Mari, it’s not a hallucination. It’s really her. Just as a spirit. She truly loves you, she forgives you for everything. And yet you keep hating yourself for it.
...Because you killed her.
bro pls censor spoilers
The post is tagged as a spoiler. Ofc the comments will contain spoilers
This is a spoiler tagged post. No needed
Yeah, but that’s a spoiler past this part of the game, and we don’t know if OP has got there yet.
Oh yeah true. Sory
mfw i go to omori subreddit and i find omori spoilers:
Though you are right you don't have to spoiler the comments, it's more just common curtsey due to the possibility of OP not reaching that part yet. That's at least my thoughts on it.
i still find it somewhat stupid to use spoiler tags at all, should be common sense that you would avoid places like this when starting something/watching something
This is true, some people just like to account for the fact that people sometimes don’t listen to the warnings and barrel though and then get mad, now I don’t care as long as you guys follow the rules go nuts.
still spoiler tags should be reserve if your spoiling another game/ show, because it gets tiring just having a constant blur when browsing in here
We do have to take in account we have a high number of people here who are currently doing a run of omori and scroll though the sub
And those people shouldnt be clicking/making spoiler tagged posts.
I take mari's ghost to be a very real presence in the game so it was probably not a hallucination.
With the window being a metaphor for the passage to the afterlife and it being open *only* when the piano is playing, i think this is true
Same.. . When the gravekeeper mentions that the spirits were becoming restless, I always took it as Mari's spirit.
Wait... there are people that don't believe Mari's spirit was real?
Its understandable. When most of the game is a semirealistic story for the most part. The supernatural can be a hard pill to swallow.
You can even see Basil's grandmother's spirit without knowing that she passed, and she also had those white flowers that meant something like "my thoughts will follow you into your dreams", which I took quite literally considering the part Mari's spirit guides Omori in headspace.
I think Sunny was hallucinating that Mari was playing the piano, but near the end he started playing the piano, but was still hallucinating that Mari was playing it. Then Hero came in. . . Shared hallucinations are a thing though, so let’s keep that in mind.
I like to believe Maris ghost is real
Guess Omori is not the only one who misses Mari…
>!I like to think that mari’s ghost was real!<
its either a shared psychosis or the mari's ghost is actually real
probably shared psychosis
>!Mari reference??!<
A few of reasons. . . Primarily, I think, is other fanbases exist and have been leveled to the ground by shipping wars by people who are entirely too into it and they don’t want to see this game follow suit because there’s so much more to discuss about the narrative than ships. . . To a lesser extent, some people just aren’t comfortable with the idea of adults shipping minors, which, you know what? Fucking fair. I personally think there’s a difference between just imagining characters hooking up and being a massive creep about it, but this is also the internet, and the line between “I like seeing these characters together due to their chemistry and/or just think it’s cute” and *certain other things* that people on the internet like to do blurs extremely easily. . . Just enjoy what you want, there’s nothing inherently wrong with wanting to ship characters. Folks just get crazy about it and turn it toxic really quickly.

Mari. Just because she reminds me of an ex-girlfriend of mine.. . Double points for perfectionism
MARI "minos" PRIME IS THAT YOU
What "other" points do you have? All of them can be summarized as I already did. But again, if didn't understand that those were jokes, it's your problem
It really isn't hard to read my previous comments if you're a little lost. I can understand why you wouldn't want to address everything else he's said that can't be excused as "jokes" since they kinda make your whole argument of him jokingly sexualizing kids fall apart. That argument was pretty weak in the first place tho . . Sexualizing children isn't a joke, get that through your head. Would you say the things he has about real children? Would it be okay because it's a joke?. . Dude is really doubling down on saying sexualizing kids is okay 💀
When have I said that sexualizing kids is okay?
When you try to brush off peoples comments that are clearly sexualizing them as a joke? It definitely comes off that way. It's a serious issue, and making excuses for people who sexualize kids is only making YOURSELF look worse. Not Bubbly, YOU. You're really willing to make yourself look bad and protect a guy who sexualizes kids, and for what?
I prefer Mario or whatever it was called
tbh, hellmari is scarier than a lot of the stuff in fnaf. I think both are good, though.
With FNAF when all of your horror in the game is jump scares it's pretty bad because unlike actual horror, Jumpscares wear off over time. It goes from "ScArY" to "Dont get jumpscared, the game.". . Real horror persists and sticks throughout the game and not just in the main "OoGA BOoGa" moments.
Well, jumpscares are the main part and the thing you remember most. It's just when the horror peaks, not when it starts. Even without the jumpscares, the situation is creepy enough. It's dark, you know monsters are hunting for you, and you see hints of children being stuffed into suits. That's creepy, even without the scares.
(Spoilers) I wish omori had more at least uncomfy moments in dream world, like the you did the poster and the cut cutsceneish moment when you were gonna go to the black space, most of uncomfy moments are just fight this very creepy enemy with Kelly instakill ball, maybe if like creepy pictures that predic events like maris bloody face made with clay, or a live action stranger (black basil with eyes) or maybe your squads face flash to something creepy or maybe them crying like when they saw mari for a second like in ddlc where a picture of the scene of the hanging lady (forgot her name kill me) replaces another picture and no one notices it in the game but you

oh goodness...Mari isn't a marketable plushie yet💀
Forget it, I see her now
Could also be because >!Mari died in October (the PHOTO ALBUM shows the final picture with Sunny and Mari practicing for the recital on September 22 and the recital, per the photo description, was due the following month) and the entire group disgregated soon after that. Winter would soon follow and it would have been the loneliest and worst thing ever for Basil.!<
It was snowing in the funeral >! we see maris grave covered in snow  when entering blackspace !<
i thought they were white flowers
Imma make a list:. . \-The feeling of loneliness/bleakness. . \-S.A.D.. . \-Something to do with Mari's death (could be her favorite season idk). . \-Lack of life/death. . idk dude
Mari
This scene confused me too, mostly because Mari seems to just disregard the topic entirely, like there was more to it, but it couldn't be revealed or something?
I think I remember Mari referring to Pessi as a "he" lol
Wait- What-
After completing his quest, talking to Mari about it in the "completed" menu has her say something like, "maybe someone should tell him"
Ain't no way.
. . from the wiki
Holly molly...
Basil and Sunny: …anyway-. . . Kel: looking ignorant to Mari/depleting the Orange Joe stock of Faraway Town. . . Mari: the amount of mistakes in her recital. . . Hero: he didn’t really do anything they just got too suspicious/ended up receiving too much gifts and ppl want them back
Mari would get cancelled for scamming old people
>!Instead of the incident occurring,!< Sunny makes a massive callout post on twitter >!regarding Mari's various outbursts at him for the smallest mistakes, also !<revealing that she engaged in various naughty acts with Hero including premarital handholding and maybe even kissing, and that's what gets Mari cancelled. Perhaps Sunny will also throw in a mention of Mari's secret stash of romance novels and manga just for good measure.
>!Maris death pics gets leaked!<
Mari gets cancelled for saying the N-word.
Omori: has infinite plot armor; would not get cancelled Sunny: >!killing Mari!<. . DW Hero: rejecting Sweetheart     RW Hero: probably for something outlandish like a misinterpreted joke. . DW Kel: putting up the flag of the butt certificate     RW Kel: liking a basketball player who is allegedly a gr\*\*mer. . DW Mari: soliciting in weird places (literal elevators)     RW Mari: >!"forcing" Sunny to play the violin!<. . DW Basil: not sure      RW Basil: spreading slightly uninformed tips about gardening. . DW Aubrey: also not sure      RW Aubrey: racism
you'd think he'd have gotten over mari if he were "drowning in pussy"
No no hero is traumatically fucking everything *because* of mari, you see
Mari deficiency, need a coping mechanism
I didn't intend for it to come out this  way. I wanted to type somthing along the lines of "if i were the you when the at" like that oven joke but I had a brain freeze moment and my fingers got tangled and smeared all over the keyboard but it was funny so I kept it because now Mari's having a stroke.
: Hey.... Mari? W-why have you been staring at me like that?



mari revengeance status
still thinking about this. you’re back mari has single handedly ruined my day… /j /lh
I just finished it… 
wait is this a fic or a thing? i've never heard it before now and i'm Interested.
yes! you’re back mari/pursuit au is a fanfic series (i think there’s two seperate works if i remember correctly?) on ao3 that focuses on an alternate universe in which hero’s mental health took an extreme turn for the worse, seeing his own ‘something’ in the form of mari essentially. it’s very dark, but reallt well written for the most part! i don’t like how they portray basil, but the rest of it excellent.

OH NO, >!MARI WAS THE AUTHOR ALL ALONG!!<
As long as it's not a retelling of the game itself, it would be good.. . Maybe a series focused on things that happened *before* the events of the game. Like the gang's friendship and what they did before >!Mari's death!<, Or maybe on Omori's adventures in headspace before the events of the game. Either way, an Omori series sounds like a cool idea. ^(just don't give it to Netflix...)

By the way, I don't hate Basil.
I was more talking about the >!hanging Mari!< situation.

Accuary: ∞
Mostly just as a meme, but some point out him having the idea for >!framing Mari's death as a suicide by hanging her!<
According to my sister it's because he had the idea to hang mari
I personally love him, put playing devil's advocate, I think most of the hate comes from the fact that he's so whiny, >!and that he came presumably up with the idea of framing Mari's accidental murder as suicide!<
personally don't hate Basil, he is a good character, but i don't understand the why of his hate.. is because his crazy idea about the fake suicide of Mari? He did this because he wanted to protect Sunny, and when he saw Mari on the floor not moving, his mental healt and his thoughts just blowed up, he fell in panic, and instaured this sad scenario. Next when he looked at the hanging Mari s body, borned his trauma, the "something" that for Basil killed her. l
Ive seen this... It made me cry. He repressed it because just like Mari he couldn't bear the burden of knowing it..
 hell just thinking about it makes me cry..
Meow? (Waiting for Mari?)


Ok what is the girl on the right is more beautiful
Mari must be ugly as shit
What did you say?

It's the same   picture
I think it’s meant to contrast with spirit Mari and be more about heaven vs. hell than anything else. That’s not the only instance that comparison is made, either. If you go to the castle keeper, for example, and step on the grate in the sunny route, you’ll get transported to some heavenly area you can walk in; the opposite is true for hikikomori. Not to mention the whole church before Blackspace kinda implying some religious themes and such.
Most people pronounce Mari as ‘Mah-Ree’ so it might not make as much sense.. . Also, thought not a cool pun, HellMari is a bit more scary of a name.
Have I been pronouncing it the wrong way this entire time... . What's the proper way to pronounce it?
like mario but without the o
Yeah so mah-ree-o?
yeah
Pretty sure Mahree is correct but I don’t remember where it was confirmed.
In OMOCAT's live streams she pronounced MARI the same way you mentioned
No it's pronounced "Meh-Ree"
We \*thought\* it was pronounced like Mary.. . But it turns out it's pronounced like Mario without the o.. . I am as shocked as you, believe me.
Yeah it does sound better,good luck on overwriting hellmari 
nightmari doesn't have as much impact as hellmari, to be honest.
Yeah but it's clever
i mean ig? it's still kinda generic to me tbh
Hellmari is more generic to me, "the scary ghost from hell guys omg"
yeah but idk, Nightmari just sounds predictable i guess
And she appears in BLACK SPACE too so HELLMARI makes more sense
Indeed. If she were asleep, we could call her nightmari.
Isn’t it because her file name is hellmari? Or am I wrong?
Yeah I think this is why
Yeah but why is that her file name
What is the essence of the universe responsible for the birth of an idea?
Beats me
There is a room litarally called hell and background matches with red space where hellmari is everywhere. . Sunny probably calls red space hell because its not only is the place truth is contained as seen from the red glow sunny feels drawn to,red glow in the final truth room and bad morning sequance before red hand throne but also its where truth is laid bare mari is no longer something but hellmari and red space calls out and judges hım . . "look at what you done" -red maze where hellmari is everywhere. . Mirror shows hım as a bloodied monster. . İn omori fight it shows his friends hanging. . Also i have to point out in sunny route where hellmaris apprance changes,the hell room gets replaced with a room called heaven and its background matches with the Clear sky at the end
hellmari is scarier and nightmari is too silly
I thought it was a pun on “hail mary”
I like Hellmari because it has a cheesy creepypasta sound to it, which also fits into the early 2000s vibe.
Mari from the h3ll
Mari from the night
Mari: I am the night.
Holy shit, Mari has been Batman the whole time?
Same reason why we ended up with the ship name “Heromari”; fans are just too lazy.
bc she looks like shes from hell duh
When I first saw her picture, I thought that the hair strands that extended past the sleeves were tentacle-like arms.
Oh my you can’t be serious I’ve thought this whole time-
As a fellow pun connoisseur, I approve 
She just wanted to say hello. . Can't spell hello without spelling hell
Tbh it's always been my interpretation that hellmari, in contrast to how Omori remembers her in his dreams, is the literal ghost of his dead sister.. . Like, Sunny has a something, which is pixelated and stylized. Omori has picnic mari who is pixelated, stylized and safe no matter what, and they both have hellmari. Hellmari is presented as being much more real, as if she's still hanging in the tree. She's not pixelated and it seems like she can terrorize Sunny/Omori anywhere, at any time. Something that isn't shared with most of the other characters surrounding "the truth".

She called that because of the game files maybe.
Isn't it because that's the name of it in the game files?
probably named after the red maze in blackspace. curtain files in-game refer to the area as hell, and hellmari is all over the place there, so, Hellmari
Sounds like Hail Mary
"Noghtmari" is a cool portmanteau, but it just sounds like an Italian nightmare lol. . >!Say anything about the vine and I *will* nuke you.!<
Why is she called hellmari? Is she stupid?
i always thought it was in reference of like “hail mary” for some reason
I always thought it was referencing the book "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir
actually it'd be a good fnaf 4 mod, imagine nightmare as hellmari
You know, Nightmari actually does make much more sense!
the game is only scary when you know why. . . . . ...and im on my second playthrough
Because she literally came from hell . . Jk honestly it’s probably just the file name
I think it's a 'Hail Mary' pun. Because it appears in the mirror. So it's like 'Bloody Mary' (the reverse of Hail Mary) but Hell Mari instead.
mari but if she was in fnaf 4 ig
It's to show that she went to hell   . . . for... some reason?   . idk.
It looks like satan made her the worst thing or she’s experiencing hell.
My interpretation is she has that name because of the phrase "Hail mary", meaning a last resort. Most people pronounce her name Mah-ree though, so it doesn't make sense when you say it aloud. As to why she would be named after that phrase in particular, I always thought it was because Mari >!(supposedly) commits suicide and suicide is a last resort. !<

Mario
That 2nd image always makes me wonder, is it like Mari hugging herself?
Mari
MARI would be angy and jealous
guys I found Mari's burner account
Probably Mari or Obaa
I.. I think it's Mari
mari
Mari what’s wrong with your room?
what if it was you can only add 143 mari plushies to cart 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😔
Mari get the fuck off your alt account >! You're supposed to be dead !<
Mari is alive and no one can convice me that I am wrong

that waffle has killed many…
>!so the waffle framed the **SUICIDE**!!!<
Shhh
lmao i remember this, i even made a meme on this when i was 15 😭
God, I hate that waffle
She expanded her mind too much
She's just too smart :(
Her hair is too.. heavy?
Lore accurate
your mari's feet arent flat on the stand, its slightly leaning back some which makes the figure lose balance. . my basil one does the same
I saw, is there anyway to fix it or should I just prob something behind it
brain damage and a bad knee
>!Affinity to falling!< :) spoiler just in case
>!Bad Knee!<
“stupidly fat head” congrat OP, you already figure that out

her >!bad knee!< got to her. . 

Hes just practicing her backflips! >!Unfortunately she cant quite stick the landing yet.!<
she can feel that there's a cliff behind her..
She can’t fight nature, she can’t fight change, she can’t fight gravity, she can’t fight nothin’
. . NOOOO
Backflip
>!It's a feature, not a bug!<
rocks in her sku l l
Gah dayum she caused an earthquake
the unbearable weight of perfection
It's her instinct to fall backwards
on a serious note you can turn the pull them apart and turn the stand around and it should solve the issue.
muscle memory
bro was so flabbergasted
she yearns for the stairs
She has fallen
ITS JUST SO FUNNY CAUSE THE WAY THE CAMERA SHAKES WHEN SHE FALLS AND STARTS WOBBLING
LMFAO
Head full, too many thoughts 
SPOILER. . . . . . . . . . . . Good thing there weren’t any stairs behind her.
She's just like that
[idk lmao]()
She did a flip
ayo the pizza is here
electrostatic gravity pull
"don't flip out but....."
she just wanted to do a backflip
Mari flips all by herself until she falls
She fell..... . >!down the stairs!<
She is expanding her mind, u/RowSpiritual3162.
Put her next to the stairs :3
Just like when she fell down the stairs
>!stairs!<
Fell down.. . . The stairs.
Don’t put her near any stairs
Someone feed him please 💔 Mari we need you
. . Splatoon did a collab with Sanrio a while back and they made plushies of Off the Hook, but they made Marina REALLY light
What's crazy is that there were people defending this decision because it's a "pastel color scheme" as if that was a valid excuse
Jesus fuck that was way worse than I initially thought :(
Those don't even look like the same character the hell
She is canonically shorter than others. . The RW gang's average height is around 5.5 feet (from my guesses). . Mari's height is >!6 feet under!<
That's foul💀
*Wow.*


Maybe because mari is dead and not grown up like the other real life plushies?
She’s only 6.2 inches tall while everyone else is 7 inches. She was advertised as 7 inches on the website.
Oh the moment it says that on the website all lore goes out the window, that’s a genuine mistake on their part. Looking at my spirit mari I can confirm she is shorter as well
on the website I thought she was 0.25inches shorter
Probably because when she died at 15, she stopped growing and everyone's RW counterparts are 16+
Maybe her >!spine got compressed!< when she >!fell down the stairs.!<
Yeah but then >!it got stretched again in the hanging!<
Overly complicated accordion
A killer accordion
i love this fandom
She shrinks to be cuter in ghost form 😂
From my experience (and from what I’ve seen for others) the plushie sizes are just generally inconsistent, especially between each restock (seems like they generally get a little smaller with each one)
Shes the youngest haha.
Mari if she locked tf in
r/FoundMari
lol so true
Close enough, welcome back Mari.
Mari really locked in w this one🔥‼️🙏
Cmon Mari we know it’s you
Yeah, I was so hyped for my spirit Mari plush, then felt disappointed when I saw it looked squished. Still love her, but I visibly see the quality change having her next to my other plushies. Shame.
Canonic Mari behavior  /j
r/FoundMari
She is about to fall
>!down some stairs?!<
Youre goddamn right
Omori fans when making a joke:
. . \[Kuina lore vietnam flashbacks\]
subtle foreshadowing
canonically accurate
LMAOOO😭😭😭😭
She's got a bad knee alright
Weird how long we've been making plastic figurines for and we still haven't found a plastic that doesn't slowly bend over time
You could try hanging her from the ceiling to give her extra support
the way my jaw dropped 😭
>!Like she did?!<
This fandom only has one joke istg
There’s more lmfao? We just use this one a lot bc it’s so shocking on what happened to Mari.
get out /j
WHAT
Her knee is messed up dude, cut her some slack
omori fans finding any opportunity to reference mari's death:
Almost like she's dangling...
Don’t worry, she’s halfway through acting out her death
When the quality does not match the cost according to multiple people and you have the choice, don't buy it.
I actually looked and the reviews are good.
People on this subreddit have been noting things about how the quality of the plushies have been going down, apparently. I think that if they are skimping out with that it makes sense that they'd be skimping out with other things
This shit should not be this expensive. 
Half the time the plushies are literally rip offs are bought from Amazon my man
I'm talking about remarks made about the OFFICIAL plushies.
This is a hint to the fact that Mari is actually bisexual and physically can't stand straight
Some jump rope should solve the problem.
She is destined to FALL
Her legs can't stand her, maybe thats why she was soo easy to push (he also has weak legs)
Place her near some stairs OP
use a small piece of string to tie her in place. . . . perhaps to a tree
the true reason why >!she fell during the stairs fight!< ,she got a big ass head
as per usual
It's because of the weight of her big stupid hair
mari's expression looks cursed
Mari >!in a timeline where she actually got her hair dyed!<
Mari
Mari, cuz who could hate her :)
Oh ik the stairs that mari fell!
but maybe mari?
It’s obviously mari
Is it mari
Idk… Is it Mari?
Thanks! >!(If i get mari she’s going down the staircase)!<
Noooooooo mari. 😭. . You should try and be ready when it drops, I hear they run out quickly. I’m going to try to get Aubrey, Omori, and Basil.
Dw im gonna lock in trust🔥nothing will stop me from reuniting heromari (also aubrey sold out last last time so i’d get basil and omori first if i was you. And then aubregine.)
Praying my mom lets me get a mari
Perhaps I can convince my parents to let me snatch a Mari
Hmmmm…idk. Is it Mari?
That mari plush
mari
Get him Mari!
Babil agrees
You get him a mari and marry him
*Mari boss theme plays*
Spirit Mari's plush apparently has a jump rope around her neck
Same I got the Mari plush and her dress is too short so you can always see her underwear.

Of course it's Mari who made this
Mari >!in a reality where stairs don't exist!<
This is just her in the canon reality as well
Plot twist: >!Mari's room is empty because her parents had to take all of hers hero plushes and figures off!<
I fear that would make me go bonkers
Ok Mari
r/foundmari u/spinnileaf
hey mari check out my new cut 
Word, was devastated when i ordered, waited a week, and found I actually pre ordered
Yeah! I also ordered a ton of other things, mostly for friends ... And now we all have to wait
You gotta make sure you don't play any of it until October.
It's that 'cuz it's October when MARI...?. Anyways, if I'm going to perform a recital in October, I should prepare myself earlier
Why would you need to prepare? Just force yourself to play and hope you don't end up throwing a violin down the stairs. 
...This is piano, I'd be MARI in this situation. So yes, I'm preparing. My bro throwing me down the stairs is something we can discuss another day
Eh, po-tay-to po-tah-to.
POTATOOOOO 🤤🤤 
I had the same thing happened to me also lol.
I used to play piano back in high school
I want pleasw
I am kinda upset about that too, I was just thinking about it
Well, this IS a late response, but we have arrived the window of time when it should arrive🤔 I'm also kinda upset bc Spirit Mari took so much less time from announce to release, but hopefully we get these soon
Yeah, talking about that, where’s my package? I ordered it on march 💀
I mean, ik it’s just October 1st but it’s already Q4, has anyone gotten their order? 😭
I don't think so, I didn't got mine yet. I checked the web yesterday and it still appears as preorder. It just said it would come at *some point* of Q4 so... We'll need to wait
Damn ☹️
Oh, well… i just got this email this morning 😭. . 
Yeah, I got the same email... As a music composer myself, I don't think it takes this long to prepare some *arrangements*, and I fully believe they kinda forgot. Furthermore, they have released instant merch recently (like ghost Mari plush), it doesn't really make sense to announce this for Mari bday and then take a whole year
Yeah, exactly! I was (still am but frustrated now too) really excited about playing these arrangements, especially You Must Carry On, i just don’t get why they didn’t just announce it next year or something like that…
i'm sorry, i took it :(
totally misread the title >!as noose!<
You mean >!jump rope!<
If only my country money was not worthless
Which country is that?
Turkiye erdoğan ruined our currency by so far that 20 dolar equals like 800 tl in turkiye which is NOT okey for a plushie
Seems I guessed correctly. Erdoğan is a bit of a twat.
Erdoğan did ruined the country now turkiye is a capitalist state which is no green thing are left and the children and the new generations can t taste what I taste in y life all because of erdogan
Get a marker for it
Got your 👂👂👂👂 nose!
○u○
Its giving Voldemort
Who nose where nose goes anymore(s)??
nooo she can't breathe anymore :(
I mean she technically doesn't need a nose since >!she doesn't breathe anymore!<
It broke off when >!she fell down the stairs!<
noseless
What the fuck is going on at the factory these are being produced in?
where did it go?. . nobody nose
It's like Voldemort got jealous of her or smth and stole her nose lmao
what do you call a mari with no body and no nose?
Bruh
Hello mari
Okay, who revived Mari?
Nah, we're living in the Rainy Mari timeline
Spinni Mari
Mari, we know its you. Drop the act.
If we ever get a face reveal can you just wear a mari mask and cosplay
ive face revealed plenty of times and im afraid to say i look absolutely nothing like mari... nor do i own her clothes!!! (i have everything but the skirt)
Adorable❤️
Mari has not slept!
She doesn't have eyelids so she can't close her eyes, but she's sleeping 
So she cant leave this dream?
nah she's just ded
aww thats so cute, also that plushie has more braincells than the cat 😭🙏
Cute :3
So eepy uwu
What’s the cats name?
Edamame 
Strange name…
That’s lovely! :)
The reason why the Mari plush is so much smaller is because she’s around the same height as the headspace mari plush, and the headspace plushies are noticeably shorter than the faraway plushies … they probably did this because >!Mari died while she was still the age she is in headspace, so she was unable to grow up like the rest of the cast!<. it could also just be pattern reuse though because the stranger plush is sized the same as the faraway plushies, making him way taller than the headspace ones
I knew that much, but she just looks off? HeadSpace Mari looks fine to me, but Ghost Mari looks stubby.
I just checked. My HeadSpace Mari definitely has a larger body. Ghost Mari is stubby.
huh . Weird . She’s pretty consistent with my hs Mari . I guess it’s just plushie dependent????? these plushies always got such a crazy range in looks 😭. . 
Is it just the angle, or does your HS Mari has a lazy eye. 😭
I didn’t even notice that but yeah I guess her face is kind of tilted …. hah .
on the website it states that both headspace mari and ghost mari should be taller than sunny and omori (in the desc where they say the height of the plushie)
They are all adorable. The most important thing that Marie is there.
 Marie ? Who is Marie ? >!Of course, it's a joke!<
It was planned
Mahree. . 
mari 👍
Ok, Mari. We already know you have a shrine for your boyfriend
you got me... 
There is no reason that SPIRIT MARI IS SO FUCKIN CUTE
I’m going to see if I can get my card fixed as it stopped working for some reason so I can finally get my girl Mari.
mari, do not the bald gang
Mari do bald gang 
We got it, Mari
Is there even one Mari.
“Heh, this is my super cool self insert. He’s very powerful and has awesome attacks and gets my crush and can defeat anyone and you can’t beat him because he can withstand heavy hits and……”. . “….I miss Mari”
>! "has awesome attacks"!<. . >!"People like you don't deserve to live."!<. . >!It hit right in the heart!!<
>!"He's too weak, too helpless... or that is what he believes."!<
its scary How if you changed a little of this text I couldnt Tell if this is directed to me or not. . But tbh wo didnt have a op oc as a coping mecanismo amirite
What do you mean, you got rid of yours?
Been trying to move on because my dude got criminally nuanced with me growing up and still making the character somewhat consistent , and with big changed in my life It stopped being natural to me(Crazy How some characters that you have that somewhat feel natural writing if you Change much stop being completely). . And cuz I feel like this may be kinda dangerous dunno
If it's not natural to you that's fine, then it's just an imaginary character.. . But otherwise, trying to suppress and eject what's ultimately a part of you can cause you more mental distress than just accepting and trying to make peace with it.
The problem is literally the opposite im a maladaptive daydreamer since forever and Ive been doing UP to no progresso on fixing that. . But I quite know that I shouldnt be Just have no clue what exactly to do
>And cuz I feel like this may be kinda dangerous dunno. . Although I was kidding, daydreaming a lot can be harmful if you start to have less time on important things to daydream.. . As for the other point, I understand, I too have a character that I changed so much about him that he is now someone else...
"My oc is my depression"
Incredibly relatable
This. Mari looks pretty much like how she is in the prologue of chapter 1 except in her headspace clothes. His imagination didn’t change anything.
But isn't Mari >!dead!<?. . or it could be that he and his mom share a bathroom
we don't see any other bathroom in game so yeah it's probably his mom's bra
MaRizz
. . Mari moment
She looks like a cat


She’s always been

Mari can though. . 
Can we draw Ghost Mari like this (Or HELLMARI) forever and ever?
>!I draw Spirit mari with the hair covering her face in funnier drawings, in more serious ones her face is exposed!<
it’s giving. . 
She gives off feline vibes there.
Mari: "You got games on your phone?"

"Damn it! Where did my eggs go! I wanted to make an omelet!". . Suspiciously egg-shaped Mari:
She’s so tiny…itty bitty
Is she really angry? She looks like a tsundere like this. It's hard for me to know if she’s angy or trying to be cute
>:<

Then we had rw angry Mari. Terrifying stuff
She doesn't even look angry just determined or mildly irritated

# IT’S MARILDERING!!!!!!
just noticed that nice detail in Mari's hair
That would be Mari's one
No but fr what would omori’s be
>! mari’s soul forever haunts their old home due to this !<
Headspace is growing unstable and mischaracterizing people. Next thing we know Mari is going to randomly start making veiled threats
Low Tier Mari.
Chat is this Luigi from Super Mario 64?
Wahoo! Luigi number 1!
L is fake.
L is real! Switch 2 has been announced wahoo!
mari after 5 hits of dat zaza. . 
She needs a Snickers.
Spoiler: >!It's Hellmari. You'll see her if you open the door for Mari on the first night.!<
Damn, it is like there is a way to do an ingenousn answer with Mari that would be so great, but it doesn't come out :p
Oh well :p
Damn even Mari is scared
Gator Guy pushed Mari to the ground.
Ah okay its justified reaction then, if he will ever need a knife for situation like that I can offer mine
His handwriting is also messy on this envelope, asking to get ingredients for Mari’s cookies.. . 
>!Mari!< looks like missngno
Commit to da funny.. . On a side note, hopefully when Rainy Mari comes out, you'll be active in making Rainy Mari contents lul
…Let me finish the HAKARI ending first…
Of course you have to finish HAKARI first, that comic should not be too affected by Rainy Mari as you wished
Sure, that’s the plan
. . "Fuck you, Hellmari"
Rainy mari, tommorow!
There will be a reveal that Mari didn't die, but she got hit in the face with a GB with a heavily glitched pokemon game.. . Her face was Missignoed irreversibly....
Will they have it so that MARI was still alive...?
I thought this is for Mari's birthday since she's not here, but then I realized that this is RW stuff, damn
Absolutely, you put it right into words. It's still hard for me to describe her complex feelings still to this day. The anger at the world, the anger at herself, the frustration... having a tough family background it might feel like she's loosing the only steady ground she ever had. Hiding behind a tough persona, refusing to allow herself to admit her wrongdoing cause that would break her tiny bit of self she holds on to. That's why i think Mari was so important to her. Being both Hero and Aubrey kinne i dare to claim Mari was equally important to both of them, just differently.. . Also it's not a long rant at all! Please go on, this is truly a neverending topic 
You mean >!that some frames of "Flower crown" become ropes in the Mari fight to remind of the hanging?!<
If it isn’t related to that, I have no clue what he’s talking about.
Same tbh
>!I'm not saying he forgot his sister, I'm saying that she forgot she died. He stayed in the dreamworld almost 24/7, and that could've warped his reality/how much time has passed. Also, I don't know why I think this, maybe it was in the playthrough I watched 1st or what, but istg it's implied/ambiguous at the very least where Mari is at in 3 days left (before the fight obv).  the narrative allows for Mari to potentially be at college/somewhere else, and that's why it's a shock when Aubrey says that Mari's dead in the church. we knew *something* happened to Mari when Basil disappears, but not what. Yet.!<. . >!Black space is a place where he represses memories. Headspace was put on top of it so he didn't have to deal with them. Aka, enter Omori, who buries all of the memories from the rw so that he doesn't feel (of course, that doesn't last). It's only when he goes outside and gets hit with the reality that Mari's dead from his friends, from her grave--which is more proof than an uncertain, incomplete phrase from dw Basil. he only discovers the truth of her death when he goes outside, both her being dead and how it happens. In the hikikomori route, he is never being confronted with her death at all rather than a crudely drawn hangman that's optional. if he knew of her death before, wouldn't it be expressed more outwardly in his dreams when he doesn't go outside?!<
>! Guessing you meant "he forgot she died" at the start there. Which like, again, you don't just forget about your sister dying. No matter how much time you spend in headspace, you gotta eat eventually you know. And every time you do you get reminded of the fact she's no longer there. Sunny escapes into headspace to avoid confronting these emotions, but escaping is very different from forgetting. Obviously, headspace would not contain many reminders of Maris death. Otherwise it's not a good place to run away to. But even then loads of "reminders" can be found all over the place. Out of place ropes, ominous tyreswings, et cetera. Her death can never be escaped, despite Sunny's (or rather Omori's) best efforts. !<. . >! Also, to me at least it was very obvious Mari was dead by the time I went through the first night terror section. Especially the Mari jumpscare just sealed it. Almost all let's players I've watched were the same. But that's besides the point anyway, the point is that there is just no way sunny would ever *forget* about his sister's death. It's just too unbelievable. !<
it's a core plot point that sunny >!forgot mari died did you play the game did you go outside did you get to the church did you read literally any of the dialogue that shows he thinks mari just 'went away'!<
I thought >! Headspace Mari knocking on the door at night and saying "I'm finally back home" implied that he deluded himself into thinking she was alive and just away from home. !<
He knows that it happened, he repressed the truth. That’s why there are >!nooses in headspace, and hellmari has a bent neck, but there are no stairs or stuff like that related to Mari!<
I don't mind the idea of having the rw show before the dw but I don't like how they revealed >!Mari's death so early on. I think the ambiguity of 'what happened to Mari? why did the friend group break apart this severely?' would make it better. the reader could obviously guess that Mari's dead, but not knowing for sure would have a greater impact imo.!<
Oh im dumb. Mari isn’t really relevant in headspace and only saves the game but only has some dialogue in places like in the picnic thing that most new players probably won’t do.
Personally, I love how something is drawn, especially with the detailing to how it’s actually supposed to be a warped version of Mari/ Mari’s hair and in the manga it actually has that scraggly dead hair texture. Also I think the reason it’s so tall is because >!Mari got hung (by a technicality, if I remember correctly she died by combo of falling down the stairs and onto the violin)!< which would mean she (and by relation Something) would be at least a little ways off the ground. Reading some of the other comments it doesn’t sound to  far fetched that Something’s size changes as Sunny’s perception of it alters. It’s been a while since I played but I also think that something was a ways away from Sunny in the mirror jumpscare? I don’t remember exactly if that’s correct but I love over analysing things so that’s just my take.
I also feel like they didn’t really acknowledge that sunny had a hard time with Mari’s death and said how much it affected them directly, I was even confused thinking I had got it wrong that she was his sister because Aubrey was so hurt. So her saying about him shutting himself in because of Mari was interesting to me.
While I am veru disappointed with some of the weird order and pacing, I do think Im willing to continue the manva if for no reason otber than I think Mari was drawn absolutely beautifully. Im also not inherently against the trauma version of the Christmas memory being towards the beginning, either.
I feel like the hellmari irl scene would be a good first chapter
i'm autistic so i'm not sure whether you are making a reference or you aren't aware but. . >!the manga actually starts with Hellmari - the first scene is Sunny receiving his violin on christmas and Mari starts asking whether he likes his present, while turning into hellmari!<. . i love that scene, as it also highlights how trapped Sunny might have felt with the situation he was in
I don't like the artistic style too much and I don't appreciate how they distorted the story, but there are some beautiful parts and the horror sequences are very good. also some sentences are wonderful "she is the glue that holds the group together" as a description for mari made me emotional knowing the plot
Why do Mari's legs look so buff
least logical reason to discuss Mari: 🗿
I want Ryuzaburo Otomo as Mari
Ok mari put the phone down
Mari, is that you?
Hello Mari. or maybe Herro Mari?
Mari is that you 💔
That’s it for this episode! The next one is Episode 17—don’t miss it! You can check it out early on my Patreon 
By the way, I'm scared of what will happen on the night of this day.... . . I mean about the Battle of Sunny and Basil (but in your comic it will be Marie vs. Hero) . . It's scary to imagine what kind of injuries Marie will receive in this fight, she will probably lose something... . . Or this battle will not happen, and you will act more originally, and probably explain these Character Designs of the original universe (I bet 100 dollars that Sunny made a deal with God for this universe)
***"IT APPEARS YOUR CHOICE IS MADE, MARI.."***
"Who said that?"
(Mari's something's eyes would pop out around the ceilings). . ***"HEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!"***
Thank you so much for continuing to work on this series. I really love it and can’t wait to see what happens next!
When is episode 17 on reddit?
Now  [
"*This straight-jacket… isn’t nearly enough to hold back my violence.*"

Yes, Episode 21 is out now!
Crazy? I was crazy once. They locked me in a room. A rubber room. A rubber room with something. And something makes me crazy.
How long does craziness last and how did the craziness end?
Hakari (no gambling)
Sorry but Mari reminds me Nicole from Class of 09'. . 
Ok that's funny

Grippy sock jail ending 👍
bro I’m called Hakari on literally everything why is this the first thing i see once I realize that-
except for Reddit but yall don’t care.

This one keeps hurting 😞. Also yeah, i came back to your Reddit :3
Nice to meet you :)
How are you? :3. Oh, and have you played Seven Days already? (The Game i recommended you months ago)
Yeah, I played it a few months ago, and I was surprised at how short it actually was. What I always find a bit frustrating with choice-based games is that I tend to make the choices *I* want to make, no matter what. Real life doesn’t really allow that, so whenever I play games, I end up progressing in the same way every time. Because of that, when a game like *Far Cry* throws heavy moral dilemmas at me, I usually stop playing. *Seven Days* wasn’t like that, though. It had clear moral rewards for your choices. Still, I didn’t want to intentionally make “bad” decisions just to see more of the story, so I didn’t get to experience everything. I know that if I had, I probably would’ve understood more of what the devs were aiming for, but I just didn’t want to force myself into choices that didn’t feel like mine. I take games pretty seriously—for example, I’ve never done the Hikikomori route in *OMORI* and probably never will. So in that sense, I won’t see every ending.. . That said, my overall impression was positive. I really liked the unique afterlife setting and the mission about finding a way to escape from it. Especially the mission placed on the protagonist—it was an incredibly tough choice for players like me, and I found myself emotionally drawn in. It even made me rethink my own perspective on death.. . The playtime was short enough that I could’ve asked for a refund, but I didn’t. At the same time, I don’t think I’ll replay it just to check out the other routes. Still, it left me with the impression of being a good game, and I felt like I gained some inspiration for how an indie game could be made. A few months have passed now, so I don’t even remember the characters’ names very well, but I still remember it as a short yet worthwhile experience. :)
Sorry for taking 2 hours to reply.. Yeah, that's what i love about Seven Days, and It's a shame that it doesn't get more attention, it has very memorable characters >! My personal favourites are Balaam and Hilde. That's why my favourite route was the one where you befriend Balaam and Hilde at the same time.!<. PD: I have the same thing with the Hikikomori Route in OMORI, it makes me feel terrible 😭
Oh, so there was actually a route like that. I guess they really tried to pack in as much content as they could, given how short the game is. Playing it again after I’ve forgotten most of it might not be a bad idea.. . And I know that feeling—you know, when you love something but other people don’t know it, or they think it’s childish. It’s especially tough as you get older, since being into certain fandoms still carries a bit of social stigma. Honestly, at my age now, there are hardly any people around me who even know the works I enjoy.. . Either way, *Seven Days Origin* is a good game, and I really hope we see more indie titles like this coming out of Korea.. . Oh, and don’t worry about replying late. I took like five hours to answer too, and we live in different time zones anyway. I really don’t mind, so it’s all good. :)
holy shit that's so much more depressing than i expected, the forever bit is down right soul crushing. great work!
# LIFE IS PAIN!. . . . Good work...
Looking at this ending, I want to laugh, instead of just killing himself. Hiro is like: No, this is too easy, I’ll turn myself in to the police and make sure the evidence points to me and not Mari.. . I know it's original BUT DON'T IT SEEM LIKE TOO MUCH OF A HASSLE to do it, and also won't the police notice how the evidence seems to be cut? . . And what about the fact that Papa Mari simply threw his daughter into a mental hospital (because she thinks she’s 4 years old) and simply left for another family with new children without a twinge of conscience....? . . HAHAHAHAHAHA He doesn't deserve to be called a scumbag, HE'S SIGMA.. . TO HAVE SO NO HESIGNATIONS THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO THROW HER DAUGHTER INTO A MENTAL HOSPITAL FOR OLD AGE AND JUST GO TO ANOTHER FAMILY, I JUST CLAIM HOW STRONG THIS MAN'S BALLS ARE
Man

Always bet on...
Sadness :(
Not like his friends were having "fun" after Mari's "suicide"
I am ready to bawl my eyes out reading the good ending of Hakari
I promise. :)
I didn't bawl when reading the bad ending, but that is because I feel pity for Mari not being able to come forth with the truth. Yes, I am literally Basil in Hakari.

I haven't read Hakari from start to finish, haven't been in the fandom long enough I don't believe, but I have been somewhat keeping up with it and I can certainly say the art has improved. I'm a sucker for Omari stories so I really like Hakari.
Thank you so much for enjoying the comic!  . I’ll do my best with the remaining chapters too—so if you're liking it so far, I hope you'll consider reading it all the way through :)

I remember a post of your comic popping up while I was browsing reddit a long time ago. Out of curiosity I went ahead to read it and since then I'm waiting for the Gmail notification about a new chapter every now and then. Your work is great, keep it up!
Your words truly give me both comfort and motivation.  . I can hardly believe you've been following my work since way back—I'm deeply grateful.  . I’ll do my best to keep creating something worthy of your continued support! :>
Yandere mari is real
reminds me of a post where someone expected mari to be kind of like monika

i feel like shes going to flex her immaculate jawline after this panel
That 2nd image reminds me of that Marty blob from LISA and now I am quite thoroughly disturbed
First chapter I prefer completely over the game, really good. I am super excited for black space now!!
I’m excited for next chapter, since they’ll probably go to Deeper Well and Omori will eat the apple. Excited to see how grotesque the adaptation will be.
Next month can't come sooner
Why does she have so much aura? One cannot withstand it.
. . aura cannot be stopped pwoxy
. . He could
Why is mari hitting the "BYE BYE! 🤫🧏‍♀️"
well this was a little bit of a spoiler for me, The second volume didn't even release yet where i live
Tbf, the title did warn you
The Spoiler filter wasn't there when the post was first uploaded
SINCE WHEN CHAPTER 12 IS OUT
I saw someone in omori community in Facebook comment to this pic And tell me this Mari pic makes them remind to [redacted] mari. 😨
Chapter 12 is out?! ...anyone got a copy I could "borrow?"
I understand Mari now......
Yeah, we all do. . . 
>!Oh.. That's MARI's hanging body as a maid.!<
If you'd like to read *Hakari* on Reddit, please click this [LINK]()! You can find all the episodes on Reddit.
When can we finally bet on Hakari?
sadly, If I didn’t have to work, the bet would be on soon. Pray my lottery bet pays off.... . I aspire to be a professional creator, and I’m fully aware that if I don’t bring this work to its conclusion, all my efforts will be meaningless. Without a proper ending, the work won’t be evaluated as a complete piece, which ultimately won’t help me grow as an artist. As someone who also loves comics, I completely understand the frustration of waiting for updates. I, too, want to finish this story as soon as possible, but it’s not always easy. That said, I promise I will see it through to the end, even if it takes a little longer. If the wait feels too long, feel free to check back later. Thank you so much for your interest!
YES A NEW EPISODE ! I LOVE THIS COMIC IT'S AMAZING !
Basil is mad at Mari for reasons we dont know yet⁉️⁉️ dawg im tweaking and speculating why. This comic series is so peak🗣️📢🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's neat to see a AU Basil that ain't a depressed mess or emo. I guess not tampering a crime scene can make quite the difference. I'm weirdly loving the DADDY energy he's emitting in this AU. I feel like that might have how his life would go...>!if he hadn't encountered a traumatic experience!<. I'm curious to see why he a bit uncomfortable around Mari here.. . A bit weird for me seeing the ship of Photobomb (Aubrey X Basil) be a thing here. Probably due to it not being the more popular ships, like Sunburn & HeroMari. Although it probably makes sense for this ship to be a thing in this AU given the circumstances in it.
Mr. Welt, when did you manage to go to another universe?. . 
Peak fiction alert
Idk why but this feels more satisfying
This is amazing work!!!
To read all the Hakari episodes uploaded to Reddit, check out this link!  . [
Holy hell I wish I found this sooner. Thanks for posting an episode list in the comments. Definitely gonna read it later
No problem—glad you found it! Hope you enjoy the story when you get the chance to read it! 
Another reason why basil is My goat. . Also. . I BELIEVE IN YOU MARI. . GIVE THEM A CHANCE AT FORGIVENESS. . AND GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE TOO
. . Funny pic out of context. Man I love this comic series and I'm so interested for the not so good ending finale 
haha, Thanks so much for enjoying the comic! It really means a lot that you’ve been following the series. I hope you’re looking forward to the finale—it might be a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, but I promise it’ll be worth it!  
Makes him look like a stalker XD
Wait till she pulls out Domain Expansion: Idle Death Gamble. /j .. . It is SO GOOD. KEEP COOKING!. . . . 
Lol, I’ve been seeing a lot of Jujutsu Kaisen memes lately. Maybe I should check it out sometime. Thanks for enjoying the comic! 
Zero Sugar Orange Joe and its still nasty
Keep Cooking OP! Can't wait for the next ep
Thanks! I’ll keep cooking—next episode’s on the way!
I'm looking forward to the new ep！
Hearing that you’re waiting for the next episode really gives me motivation. I’ll do my best to make sure it’s worth the wait! 
I have a question. How is Mari seeing the OG Omori versions of her friends?
This is an important part that will be explained in the ending. However, if it's still unclear, I'll provide a verbal explanation afterwards. Thank you for reading. On a different note, progress has been a bit slow due to some work-related issues. I'll try to finish and upload the next episode as soon as possible. Thanks!
Gotcha! Can’t wait to see how she is getting these visions.



My sis really Say; ""
i didnt even notice that was ment to be smug mari-

Very nice!. Now jump down the stairs.

I need picture with stairs
She looks like Yuri.
Stair cosplay next
where’d you get your wig from?
Aliexpress
Dont get near stairs when wearing that
Congrats, you just made me realize that all characters from omori with messy hair have a big hairspray in between their eyes or in the upper middle of their face
Watch out for the stairs, please
I really like your hair lol, how do you get it so straight? I cant get mine not to be curly as hell lol
Lowkey thought you were yuri from ddlc for a sec.. Edit: It appears many people have said this. I didn't realize how similar they were because I'm used to seeing Mari when she's at the bottom of the stairs or chillin by a tree in the dark

stairs perhaps?
me about to type "cosplay falling down the stairs". me stopping myself from saying that cuz its mean. . me: "imma just write this comment instead"
BRO 70% OF COMMENT ARE ABOUT FUCKING STAIRS I SWEAR IMMA GONNA JUMP IN RN
IM SORRYYY TwT DONT JUMP
There should definitely be one of you just on the floor face down next to some stairs (for the funny)
it wouldve been perfect if you made a nice smile, but overall great cosplay :)

no pics at the bottom of the stairs : (
wow! this post attracted an FBI watchlist! :). . anyway we got tea together  happy birthday little flower man i forgive you for your transgressions against me . .

The Good Ending.
LETS GOOOOO!!!
a nice picnic with tea and cookies :3
Hug him love him
Release him into the wild
i’ll find the nearest flower field 
The first pic reminds me one of Peach's taunts in smash bros
i aspire to have her whimsy, this feels like a compliment omg  
you should hug him
Start playing piano, this will surely bring down a path of success...
bring him to the store and buy him flowers❤️❤️❤️❤️
Drown him, throw him down a hill, make him bald, kick him
bake him a cake and then smash him into it
Bake him into a cake and then smash the cake
hang him

2nd photo goes so hard
i kinda wanted it to feel like in animal crossing when you show off a creature you caught. you feel me. . 
Microwave 
DOs: give him head pats, hugs, flowers, lots of love, take him to a picnic outside, let him take your pictures and photograph all the happy moments. . DON'Ts: do not stab him, do not hang him, do not move to another city. . WARNING: if anything bad happens, leave him alone in the bathroom and he will eventually go back to normal, do not confront him with a knife under any circumstances

 THIS IS THE WORST REPLY YOU WIN FOR WORST REPLY
I could do worse: shove him inside and let him drink blood
I almost read that "as let him drink that". what is wrong with m-. . 

ma'am but the child down. he just wants to water flowers and play with jump ropes!
2 probably. . consider also letting him frolic in a field of flowers for enrichment
>!Hang him in a tree, give him a taste of his own medicine!<
buy him a very expensive camera and then eat a lil bit o watermelon with him and then and only after that you can drink milk tea with him
Forgive the poor mentally ill boy
protec me and keep me safe? QQ
ofc ofc 
You give a nice stern mother look lol. . Also give him boba tea. . 
Put him in a pot of flowers or dig him in a cake
I know I'm late but put him in a blender 👹
Put him in a grass field too for the nourishment that he obviously hasn’t gotten in the past 4 years
He looks perfect
You know who else is perfect?
Crush it
Shove him in the lake and send the malnourished shut in to save him
KILL!!!!!
KILL!!!!!
vacuum chamber.
Is my birthday too i say you give him to me
Probably not fall down any significant height, because he will hang you if you do
Make a cake. Put him inside. Cook it.. . And then let it BURRRN
3. give him a push
pour acid on him
Throw him in a body of water.. . A warm bath of course.
Put him in an... Elevator..
throw him against the wall
Fill him with milk and throw him against wall
Make sure to not drop him >!down the staircase!<

You look exactly like Mari

Punt him Into the sun. . He DOESNT deserve it, but he looks pintable
Nothing violent, please.
CONSUME THE BABIL. . 
Murder
Make him suffocate in box while having a disastrous pre-death visions in process
Stab him in the eye. Drown him. DROWN HIM
Eat him

I think you should hang out

Pour milk tea over him until sopping wet then throw against wall to obtain meaty sound and suck the milk tea out. . Repeat process until satisfied
Watermelon
flush him down the toilet
Stuff him in a microwave
blender🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Mix with watermelon in a blender Or just give him a salad
And maybe a violin.
Eat it 😈

Take his eyes out and then see how the oven will burn him
its mari from the hit game omori
Microwave

Unrelated but I think you’re making me turn into a scissor sister bc why r u looking ethereal fdsdgsddyfvyigho
Give him flowers pretty sure he likes those
A: if you're underage you could cuddle or throw him in the washer to drown him. . B: if you're adult you can >!drown him in alcohol to get him drunk!<
 he’s only a baby
Drunkify him
Burn him
I know this post is very old, but I need to know what this type of top is called. Does anyone know?
Eat.
Tell him he’s a poopy face
Flush him down the toilet.

thank you! i am glad you think so!!!  ♥️
You managed to capture the cute and cool energy of the character congratulations
They made her real whaduhel

You actually look like the real mari. Please change your legal name to mari suzuki and become them. N O W
you look exactly how i imagined mari would look!
Hey, who told you were allowed to leave the game? Stop pretending to be a cosplayer.
 hehehehe. . thank you for your comment 
No way mari it that you?! (amazing cosplay w)
This is an amazing cosplay!!
The REAL RW Mari
"Closet" what else are you missing? This is already really accurate :3
that’s such a lovely cosplay ! i love the wig especially. would you mind telling me which one it is and maybe some advice on how to get mine looking like yours ?
i can dm you a link if you’d like!!! it truly just takes a lot of hairspray lol  it’s just a generic long, black wig with super long bangs. so i first sectioned the bangs, and just got to trimming (it was really mostly the center portion) until i was satisfied with the shape. i didn’t just cut straight across, i tapered it by cutting diagonally to create more dimension! i hope that makes sense. 
i’d love a link if you wouldn’t mind !
did you dye your hair in the last picture or something
yeah i was feeling something different 
Looks good!
thank you!!!! 
Mari no, your brother is not for eating! Sibling, not snack!. . Fr tho, really nice cosplay!
if not food, why snack size…..  the plushies are so cute lol i want to bite!! and thank you so much!!!!!! 
WOW ON THE LAST SLIDE YOU REALLY LOOK A LOT LIKE HER, THAT WAS SOME AWESOME MAKEUP!
well yes!!! 
AHHH THIS IS SO ACCURATE!!! It looks so good, you did an awesome job! your car is so cute btw . . >!(please do not the stairs)!<

Makima must have told him that working for her is what mari wanted
Wow! That is one snazzy outfit! Amazing cosplay, friend :D. . If I can offer a suggestion, you should try Mari next! :)
thanks so much! i will definitely do that (: thanks for your suggestion!!
Wow this looks amazing! You should do Mari next.
thanks so much! i definitely will 
Very nice cosplay, such a bland facial expression lmao. Clearly it’s very in character, but maybe if you do this again, you go for a more expressive one like Mari!
oh man, i was so sad when mari did that to him right after though. . easily one of the biggest betrayals of the year

This is exactly what i'd imagine Mari as if she was irl. . I have another idea for a Mari cosplay:. . 
You’re vile for that one. . . *insert obligatory comment of hating Mari dead jokes cos it ignores her character*/j

Nice cosplay . . Especially the stairs part 
wait was the post tagged as spoiler or was it me that did it by mistake? does this count as spoiler??
im guessing it does count because of “something” and the stairs
Correct
I don't think so, you see them both before the prologue starts
Historically Accurate Mari
You unironically make a great Mari 
OMG YOU’RE SO PRETTY 🥺🥺🥺

The game is very sad, but it's also very heart warming and wholesome, the story telling elements are very well executed, and as a result the game gained a massive fan base. However, most people don't want to be sad and/or dwell on depressing things. So while we all will greatly love and appreciate the game, by nature our fan content isn't going to be primarily negative or be shown as such.
Now do the funny Mari thing
Impressive! It's really good
Beautiful!
thank you smm!! :D

evil and. . intimidating >!staircase!<
It looks good. Now make them monochrome to turn them into Hikiko cosplays.

That tree... gulp
you look exactly how i remember her...
OMORI Sandbox mentioned. This subreddit knows peak.
YESSSS
Is that a wig or are you just a stylist?
I'm either lucky or unlucky to don't have>! a Mari !< in my life
“Come on Mari, get up. Please don’t tell mom, it’s just a joke”. . ”……”. . ”I’ll let you push me too. Then we’re equal. Please just get up and don’t tell mom”
: .................
i was born in the same day as mari lol
That’s actually a pretty good set up for an AU. . *I now wish to see a delinquent version of Mari*
Real talk mari would forgive 
ofc she would, doesn’t mari already forgive sunny several times throughout the game? :’)
Not real Mari 
Isn't it implied that >!maris spirit isn't just a hallucination and is maris actual ghost? If that's true than she already forgave him and wants him to forgive himself!<
i choose to believe this!! 
I certainly think so. It would make sense. Also it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Sunny knew Mari better than anyone else. >! If anyone would know Mari's forgiveness, it would be Sunny. !<
That's some copium I'm willing to agree with
even if she is just a hallucination, we know from what we see of maris real personality that she would 100% forgive him and more importantly, want him to forgive himself.
It is implied but we can’t know for sure. It could still just be a positive self talk.
Does everything have to be explicitly stated these days?. . It’s implied for a reason lol. . . . I’m not saying we should go around saying ”CANON CANON CANON” or something but aaagh we just can’t win
There's also that part where Hero says he heard the piano being played from downstairs, shortly after the Mari apparition there vanishes.
come on it’s kinda common sense that mari would forgive her little brother and want him to move on seeing as she has such a caring and loving personality.
Not confirmed in any way whatsoever
real Mari never did
Yes.
I mean she confirms it in headspace right
Headspace Mari is kinda just Sunny tho
Not the area before the last resort when she like leaves out the giant window. To me that was the spirit of Mari but the Mari at the picnic is more Sunny. Tho she ultimately leads you to Basils house which is black space so shes kinda also still kinda there
She probably forgave him as she was tumbling down.
the sprite used for maris ghost is so beautiful. i’ve never felt so sad about a fictional characters death before until i played omori 
Mari literally died…
ghost
Nu
I mean, deadspace Mari already forgave him, so double points
Is Mari actually dead 
No shit, you mean the guy who knew sunny killed mari/helped him cover it up would forgive him for killing mari?
Well, i do admit it's entirely up to interpretation. But I personally believe that Mari's spirit does appear and talk to sunny. Otherwise the piano scene wouldn't make sense. But if Mari is a hallucination then yeah lmao maris dead.
I feel like supernatural elements kinda ruins the appeal of the game. But I guess that’s up to opinion.
Yeah... I kind of agree with that too. But while I think it's more fitting story wise for Mari to just be dead, I've yet to hear a good reason as to why both sunny and Hero heard the piano playing downstairs at the exact same time.
mari you bastard, how hard is it to forgive someone for your death?
Mari's the one waving out of the treehouse window, it's pretty faint and blurry tho
Just like Mari probably wasn't that angel of the housefire
"He thinks he's monster". . lol. . I think I would rephrase this as how he hates himself after what he did to Mari and is just one step away from commiting suicide.
But I'm too lazy to repost it, so It'll stay like that.
I always wonder where people get he did it out of malice. I always assumed he pushed her to get her away from him and didn't really think about the stairs. If the argument had happened literally anywhere else Mari would still be alive.
I'm pretty sure Sunny tried to push past her because she was blocking his way and he wanted to leave, which then resulted on Mari tripping and falling. If you go into the game files (or search it up) you can find description texts for the pictures of the truth. And they do say that Mari stopped Sunny from running away.    . I do recommend reading the descriptions when you have the time. They're very tragic and interesting
I have read them! It’s just been awhile haha. . I wish they were in the game proper but I understand why they’re not: ultimately the photos without the description in-game are very haunting and powerful.
hell it shouldn't have happened anyway but Mari had a bad knee bc she overexerted herself at sports and *that's* why she fell. it's a real tragedy all around
Well now that you mention it, >!all the minor variants of SOMETHING do end in I... LILLI, CINDI, DOROTHI... ...now that I think about it, Mari's name ends in I too.!<
Mari was going to be named mary, and the somethings have names that end with y in the demo files (dorothy for example)
That's a very... *interesting* development, I suppose.
Omory
Omoly blackspace 
Abbi...
Bro i keep accidentally calling Mari "mary" instead of Mari ok that does not make any sense
corpses dont always have their eyes closed. mari's corpse could have actually just had open eyes.
There's a background in Black Space of Something with half of a real girl's face where the "eye" is... So it was maybe Mari's face that he saw and it's stylized to make Something/the cut scene more symbolically relevant
yeah this comment's old af ik sorry
I think he tales insperation from his sister! 😀 . . We all know how angry Mari gets when she's  >!left hanging!<
>!-learn necromancy and revive MARI!<
Only right answer.

um.. bone?
Mastery over life and death was chief among my early pursuits i began in humility but my ambition was limitless who could have divined the prophetic import of something as unremarkable as a twitch in the leg of a dead rat
Omori fans when they see the word pursuit: 
"-start a cult to revive Mari, and possibly start a zombie apocalypse, I stand out like a sore thumb with this bat, I won't be judged if it's for self defence."
the only right answer

Chef Boyardee 😢




I’m pretty sure everyone is in some form of pajamas, as headspace is a never ending sleepover. (Except Mari, she’s dressed well)
Or maybe Mari just sleep’s in those clothes out of being too tired to change after piano lesson’s.
sounds uncomfortable as fuck
Not if you’re physically and mentally exhausted

i sleep in my day clothes and im fine
seconding this
Thirding this
fourthing this
Fifthing this.

ah yes, i love sleeping in overalls 
As do we all
Maybe it's the clothes she wore in her funeral
Bc she’s having a picnic
Likes mari's hugs 
Oh... People actually believed the Hollow Knight theory..? Even after MatPat said he intentionally skipped crucial plot points to make his theory valid? Well dang, that's new to me. . . I agree, it would be pretty bad if MatPat made a theory where Mari was an abusive sister or something and people believed in it, but still, we shouldn't gatekeep the game from other people by whining like a baby on Twitter because we don't want a random person on the internet that we will probably never meet to say something that could be hypothetically wrong in the future. Instead, we should invite people to experience the game themselves and make their own conclusions. And even if MatPat made a silly theory and people believed in it, we should still help them understand the plot and make the community better :)
he only referenced omori cause of the evertale ads that were going around a while ago if you remember. Probably nothing
Also, theorising is just theorising, it's not like it takes away from the game or changes things, I haven't watched a matpat video in years but I'm sure people enjoy it and there's not much wrong with that
If he’s going to make a theory, it should be something wild like the powers of the dream world being real, or something.
premarital??? 😔😔 I'm disappointed
It’s not premarital if they don’t get married
They made pre marital eye c*ntact 😶😳
not necessarily *dating*, but flirting at least. as basil's photo album says, "[mari's dad might get kind of mad if he saw \[hero and mari together\]]()," so based on that I would guess that they were never able to properly have a relationship.
I think you can say someones your girlfriend/boyfriend when you constantly flirt, cuddle and hang out with them
The world will try its hardest. .  to make mari and hero couples
omg wow never couldve guessed. . maris dad might be mad...............
>!Mari got staired and it's now ruined!<
Mari X Hero is canonically in a relationship but since Mari died in the >!Stairs!<.
considering he stopped going outside since the late 90s>! after mari's death!< and the game takes place 4-5 years after that,  maybe he was just familiar with 90s tech more than early 20s ones since he was inside his home for all those years.
>!My headcanon is that Mari "went hanging with the boys" in October of 1997, and that OMORI itself takes place in march or april of 2001.!<
The real question is where the hell did he get the whitespace laptop from?
Welp, looks like >!we have another Mari at our hands!!<
and he said they have stairs
just do it >!mari style!< then.
Mario 3 moment
The >!stairs thing really happened, but Mari survived. The events of the game are just nightmares and hallucinations caused by guilt that Sunny had during the months that Mari was in a coma.!<
This explains why >!Mari is in the group photo [where they're grown up]()!<
And for her special, Mari wields a-. . 
&#x200B;. . 
good bot
Good bot
bloody mari
The only headcanon I posses os that Mari Plays tf2 and mains Medic

Kel tends to bottle his emotions to the point of panic attacks, less often now, but when they were bad Hero tried to comfort him through them.. . Sunny is afraid of the shadows in his room (like yk when clothes are on a chair or smth and it looks like a monster). . Basil’s deranged idea to >!hang Mari’s body!< stems from parental issues and neglect. . Mari’s perfectionism comes from hers and Sunny’s parents. . Hero has a goldfish tank and he enjoys watching them swim around. . Not a night has gone by in the past for years where Aubrey hasnt >!verbally said goodnight to Mari before falling asleep herself!<
Mari can take on the forms you see in the game, at the first night she takes the form of hellmari to try to shock sunny awake, since she sees he’s probably still hallucinating, after seeing it’s not doing well, she becomes a less scary version. . In the hikkikomori route she becomes hellmari more often since she is resorting to anything to try to snap sunny awake
Only thing I can think of is Mari is bi
-Kel and Hero are Hispanic. -sunny is a nonverbal autistic . -Mari loves cottagecore. -Aubrey listens to marina and the diamonds. -basil smells like fresh mint
Aubrey is very cool for listening to Marina’s music.
It fits her vibe In my opinion. From the cheerful primadonna girl, bubblegum bitch and oh no the serious and sad new america, teen idle and family jewels
I already commented but I thought of a second one and idk if this is common or what but >! I like to think that the Mari that goes with Omori before black space is actually Mari's spirit, projecting herself into Sunny's headspace or smth !<. . Idk
The one that went into the windowsill?
Uh I think. . I don't remember that segment too accurately
I’m pretty sure that was actually Mari
Oh. . Well. . I was right
Yeah I think this is clearly the intent.
Thats Definitely HELLMARI
Gamer Mari
mcdonald babil
-Mari was going to school for psychology (I dont know if it was in the game but even if it was ill ignore it lol). -Basil is decently superstitious and Aubrey makes fun of him for it. -Sunny hates math but likes history and Mari is the opposite
Mari is not dead, but in vegetative state because sunny was pretty smart so he called ambulance when Mari fell off the stairs.
That's even worse 
mari never died everyone is happy
When Hero was eating Mari's cookies he was getting all the chocolate out and giving it to Mari because ,,The Best from the cookies for the Best girl from the world"
In HEADSPACE, almost everyone OMORI meets is warm to the touch, particularly that of his friends. The one exception being Mari. Because all he can remember of her, is her cold body at the bottom of the stairs.
Mari is the top in the hero×mari ship
don't forget about mari's birthday on the 1st of march  . the sub won't be as crazy, but you should still expect an influx of mari fanart
Mawee
Thats's a very good Analysis, and also a refershing one since a lot of people seem to be certain the 'parents know' theory is the right one. . . I don't really belive the theory either. I posted this on another post on this topic (don't want to re-write lol), mostly in regard to where the father might be and why his mother seems loving, but also kind of distant:  . . *I have a theory different from the 'the parents know'-idea: After Mari's death, Sunny must have already been pretty deep in his unemotional hikkikomori state. So he probably didn't show much reaction to the whole incident.*. . *As another commenter pointed out, death of a child can cause parents to split: all that anger, confusion, sadness etc. is even too much for adults handle at times. There would also be the question of guilt: Mari allegedly killed herself, so how didn't they notice the signs? It's very easy to put the blame onto the other, so I guess there was a lot of tension between the parents already.*. . *Now imagine stuff like the funeral, or the general situation: everyone is so overcome with emotions and trying to cope- but there is your son, basically showing no emotion or reaction at all, like he doesn't care.*. . *So I imagine the parents breaking up, and the dad leaving his family for good, because how could he care for a family in which the son doesn't care for the death of his own sister and a mother (probably) protecting him?*. . What I also take issue with every time it comes up: why would there be a deeper investigation into Mari's death? There is no suggestion of foul-play, why would the parents bring anyone into this? I would even go so far and say that a teenage girl, that is kinda perfectionist and and stressed (it mentions in the photos that Mari stays late at school to learn and stuff, also the musical training), taking her own life is shocking and tragic but unfortunately not shocking enough to bear any further thought. Like you mentioned, mental health isn't exactly talked about, so even if police was brought into this, they would probably not bother much with it. . . But ultimately this is up to interpretation in the end: there can really be arguments made for either side, and if it was important enough to the story, it probably would have been made clearer. . . (I also wonder what significance it has that one of the most common enemies in Headspace are bunnies, the pet Aubrey has...A child's crush getting a bit sour? Because I agree that Sunny had a crush on Aubrey, but it's kinda hard to tell if it was mutual.)
\>*and the dad leaving his family for good, because how could he care for a family in which the son doesn't care for the death of his own sister and a mother (probably) protecting him?*. . ..Would be pretty inconsiderate of the dad, especially with his own son, but in the process of such strong grief for the daughter they might've even favored^(( you can tell how perfect she's supposed to seem even in the real world, it's far from impossible),) as well as all of that mental health stigma, yeah
I'm a bit late for the party but I hope I can leave some food for thought.. . It is possible for Mari to not have died when she fell down the stairs. Rather, she had merely been knocked unconcious from the fall. The tragedy kicks in when two kids are left alone in a situation such as this, who assume that a person is dead because she has been unresponsive for some time, try to stage a scene where it seems she just hanged herself, and end up murdering her instead. Lest the final 'picture' where Mari opens her eye as she is hanged.. .   It sounds a bit weird but there had been a case a few years ago in my city where a kid had gotten into a fight with their gramps, shoved him, accidently knocking him unconcious, then starting to panic and setting the house on fire. Thrilling story.. .  I don't think that OMOCAT is a forensic scientist, or has deeply consulted one, or actually needs to. What really matters is the story beats, such as the manslaughter and its ramifications on the concience of adolescents, rather then how the crime was carried out, and if the manner in which it was depicted in the media is realistic enough.( realistic enough for what?). . Apolohgies in advance if there are any errors in text, I am typing this from a phone with a rather small screen.

I was thinking the exact same thing about Mari still being alive until she was hung, and I can see how having a "dead" person stared at you after you murdered them could haunt you endlessly in your sleep. It doesn't even matter whether Sunny realized that Mari was still alive nor if he just thought that a corpse suddenly posses supernatural powers to open her eyes and stare back at her murderer, either way is equally disturbing and traumatic on so many levels, not to mention for a 11 year old child.
holy shit. the idea that they hung mari and killed her is fucking brutal. i hate it (read: love it).
I've actually changed my mind. I now believe that Mari died back when she fell down the stairs. The entity looking back at them is not Mari, but Something. The whole point of Mari's corpse opening its eye is to signify to the audience when the tragedy and the unraveling of every one involved in the story begins.
i like that as well! i could also see it (pun?) as being the paranoia and especially guilt weighing heavy on their minds. like mari is staring at them, wordlessly saying "I know what you did. you killed me, and you're covering it up, but i see you." i'm reminded of sunny in the black space, once you find the photos, being illuminated with a sudden circle of pointing fingers. . i enjoy the ambiguity in this part! it leaves a lot to the imagination and debate about its meaning.
   I don't understand your comment, they both saw the same corpse, so both of their Somethings would end up with some similarities. Spinal cord injuries wouldn't paralyse the face. If she was merely unconscious from the blow and and even quadriplegic, she could still use the muscles of her head. Of course, if the spinal injury was on the third to fifth vertebrates, at best she would be hospitalized in the ICU for a few days before she passed away, as those are the areas which control the lungs.
I know, but I mean the fact that she was in a laying or laying-like position for most of the time before she was hung would still mean that the lividity would be affected by this, since I doubt 2 small children carrying a body up and down stairs would be quick. Plus with Mari laying in the bed and Sunny crying beside it, Basil would probably be too upset to interrupt Sunny right away. As well as the fact of Sunny's positioning beside Mari's bed in different photos implying a fair amount of time passing, crying, then calming down.. . And this is just a personal take: it's entirely likely that Sunny could have cried himself to sleep at Mari's bedside, and I don't think Basil would have thought of staging Mari's death as a suicide all that quickly.. . Basically I believe the amount of time that Mari was in a laying posituon is likely to have been enough for lividity to set in
Everyone seems to think Mari having no visible injury is dubious, which is fair as she fell down the stairs.. . I however would like to raise a few possibilities.. . 1. From what we can tell she seemed to fall straight back, probably breaking her neck with the first contact(s) with the stairs themselves. That's not to say Mari still didn't sustain bruising or broken bones but rather she fell in such a way that perhaps it just didn't appear in places visible to any Normal Jo observer.. . 2. It often takes a lot of *time* for bruises to appear on the skin, especially if minor. There's been many times where I've only seen bruising from an area on my body that endured blunt trauma (say, maybe I miscalculated my distance from a table corner and accidentally bumped into it) after a sizable portion of time has passed. I do think the whole Mari incident in all took a long time but I believe it's still possible her bruising just hadn't formed yet. True that stair collision from the top of them probably are more major bruises but I argue the point still stands.. . Bones are of course a different story...if they're compound fractures. Simple fractures on the other hand are easily obscured and unknown to outside observation via their nature. It's probable any fractures Mari had were simple ones.. . 3. Mari often wore more modest clothing (the question as to whether she actually preferred modest clothing or if she was/felt she was expected to is an interesting question in of itself but a different conversation) and in as seen in the Truth photos, this is indeed the case for that tragic day. Her shirt while having shorter sleeves does indeed cover her torso itself and she wore a long skirt. In addition she also wore socks, and having a mostly covered body would probably hide the bruising to most. . . Only those investigating more closely/doing autopsies would notice such a thing but this is unlikely considering the OP's explanations on the matter. Therefore it could very well look like a suicide  to everyone.. . In connection with previous points if she fell in a way that didn't bruise her arms and maybe even her face no one would see the wounds.. . . . That's not necessarily to debunk neither the Parents Knew nor Parents Didn't Know theories; rather it gives them both more ground to stand on.. . Reading this and going through the comments as well as my own biased feelings going into this I'm actually torn on which theory I lean toward. They both seem to make sense and as the parents aren't central or important to the story (it's why they aren't properly seen) they could be interpreted in infinite ways.. . Disclaimer that I'm not a medical professional or physics teacher so I very well may have misunderstood something.
Unrelated to Mari's injuries but related to the theories of whether or not parents knew.. . The violin. Especially with an unused text file in the code.. . I think it'd cause some contention either way: The Dad, not seeing it anywhere or coming across the shreds prompt a horrid conclusion. . . 1. Sunny was the final straw for Mari and why she took her life. When he smashed the instrument they lost all their hard work and it was a gift so precious. The pain of this event, *especially* on top of all of her stress, prompts her to hang herself. In his deep grief he pushes the blame onto his son where there is no blame to be had. ("YOU did this! You killed her!"). . 2. The violin being smashed, in addition to what they already know paints a grimmer picture- Mari came to Sunny, upset by what he has done and naturally she would be. The fact he pushed her because of the violin would only breed contempt. After all a violin can be fixed or replaced, but their only daughter is now forever gone because of their son. Very heavy stuff no matter how much you love your offspring, how willing you are to protect both/either him and/or your reputation.. . . Any Mari favoritism (which I personally believe there was, particularly by the Dad) would only amplify the complicated feelings. With both theories this remains true.
mari as a mafia girlboss? honestly that's my favourite AU idea yet
Just Mari with a fucking fedora and pistol, just like "pay up sunny"
New Au just dropped, guys
Mari is Maria 
>!well people think mari did the funny sooo if this is ture then.....yeah!<
thats kinda what i was implying
thats dark
yea…
wouldnt that make mari apart of the mafia?
You are right and it is an allusion, the reason i said it is foreshadowing though is because >!the boys find a dead body in that short story!< and i kinda feel like that foreshadows >!Mari's hanging dead body!<
YO, THAT'S EVIL AND PERFECT
just like mari
: **You killed Mari. Your sister? The person all your friends loved?**
:Mari? I hardly know her! Hahahahaha. Seriously though, what?
: .... . : **All that, and you can't even remember your own sister?** . . : **I can't even...**
: you don’t remember her either, do you.
: **That's none of your business.**
: sure buddy, sure…
: **If you'll excuse me, I have other things to attend to.**
: of course of course
is it just me or did i read it as omari
Not just you- 

 I have no idea why I used the smug Mari omoji.
smug mari 
 she smug




I also feel like he would be somewhat relieved to know it wasn’t a suicide and it wasn’t because he wasn’t there for Mari
. . . . . . Mari got taken over
. . . . 
. . . . 





. . . . . . 

“Sunny, Mari’s like, right next to us. I think Basil knocked you out too hard after you asked him to “hop on bloons” with you”. . Mari: how many fingers am i holding little brother
:50?
They all start getting upset at him, and then mari comes into the hospital room and goes ”It was just a prank bro”
You’ve either told her way too much or she already knows. I didn’t realise something was mari until the. Final act
My man Mari is literally the one knocking the door
Yeah but then you open the door and it’s this deformed thing. I thought it was some sort of skinwalker guy pretending to be mari
Idk on my first playthrough I thought it was Mari too
Well. How. Much about the game did you know before you played. All I. Saw was the poster before I played it so I thought it’d be a normal. Horror. Game with some sort of monster
I went into the game fully blind because my friend recommended it to me
Something was Mari? Since when?!
More like SUNNY'S guilt about  MARI
Yeah, that was what I thought it was
off topic but i love your pfp
Thank you!
>Thank you!. . You're welcome!
How she knows helmari is called helmari anyways lol
Or she did her research
How does he know that sprite is called helmari? She probably watched omori content and got spoiled. Maybe it was lots of minor spoilers that helped her deduce the plot or major spoiler idk
She didn’t pay attention when opening the door and asked me about the “thing that was in the door” so I just pulled up an image of hellmari
You can check the bathroom mirror after that door scene to see her behind you
Wait you serious?
Yeah, she stays there until you click away too, so it’s not just a jumpscare. . 
Neat I never saw that before
when i saw that i screamed so fucking loud
After that i never wanted to see the mirror again, so at every possible interval i would inspect every mirror in the game.
are we the same person??
“Neat” is a way of describing it
What she literally just figured out that Mari died
You already know Mari died by then, Aubrey tells the player in the church before you give the book back to Basil
I know I meant during that day
She definitely got spoiled on some parts because there is no way.. . Edit: How does she know who Hellmari is?
>!I think there is also another detail…Mari had a bad knee due to an injury she suffered while playing softball…this is also seen in Headspace when Mari walks with you and you start running, she tells you not to run since she she can't run because of that and if you continue the run option is cancelled... also in the tree house there is a softball bat whose description says that Mari played softball before.!<. . >!Although I don't know if I'm right... what do you think?!<
>!you pushed mari into the air! you know she can't float!!<
Hi Mari
Hi anonymous person called "KayMGames"
Hello, random citizen!
Hi very cis person
Hi banana person
Hi, black cat
Hi, random person on the internet
hi Fox9000231
I've been reading You're Back, Mari and I just can't see him the same...
Holy shit, these endings are more complicated to get than KOTOR 2. I still don't understand how the Hikikomori ending supposed to be done since >!you have to open the door for Kel to progress the story in my first run, wouldn't be surprised if you need to finish the first gameplay run to get the other endings!<. . Edit: Holy fuckin shit, I knew the devs pulled a "Silent Hill 2" onto us, >!I knew my guess that Sunny killed Mari and he tryna removed that memory onto his mind was right, similar to learning the fact that James Sunderland killed Mary cuz she has an illness and she's going to die from it soon, causing James to be angry at her, similar to Sunny being angry at Mari cuz he cant take those violin lessons no longer. Coincidentally, both Mari and Mary both spelled and pronounced similar!<
You need to take a nap after interacting with the door and choosing to do nothing to get to the Hikikomori route.
Wait wait wait i think this is a joke on protons and neutrons splitting into 2 up quarks and one down quark, or the other way round
Top tier joke, I never would've catched that.
Rabbits are the fundamental building blocks of the universe
Holy moley you’re right
Technically speaking you can never observe a singular quark, so therefore a proton/neutron can't really split into quarks - they are merely composed of quarks.
It's possible, but there are just too many buns and she makes all her creations by hand.
perhaps uh they bred? ...
I mean the drawing looks like one bunny splitting into 3 so it may be possible that the bunny she made can self replicate
maybe... well this is omori's imagination so... i have no idea
ib awl stoorps phrum payshent zeyroe
I wouldn't say this is impossible, but why would Marina make two identical buns? Or can they perform mitosis?
Considering how bunnies irl are notorious for having their populations explode very easily, I wouldn't be surprised if she just bred a bunch of bunnies and did a bunch of stuff to them untill they all turned into the various diffirent bunny types.. . Or it's just some kinda weird "natural" bunny evolution thing, where the bunnies adapted to their surroundings in nonsensical ways.. . The slime bunnies are 100% her creations though, pretty sure that can't be debated about.
HEY THERE, AND THIS IS GAME THEORY! AND TODAY, WE’RE LOOKING AT THE OMORI THEORY THAT MARINA CAUSED BUNNY MUTATIONSSS!
but in the orange oasis's breaven, if you sacrifice the bunny for the fight you get the food bunnies so i don't think she did
i used to think (and still think) that the sprout bunny is the result of a forest bunny and a sprout mole being mixed by one of the slime girls, probably marina
I think Mari fits another character too 
Just don't gently open any doors
>!the one in the backyard or the one in the room?!<  >!💀!<
Go ahead, open all the doors you want. Just not gently
who are we talking about here? i didn't catch it :(
That got dark
Just Mari.
maris ghost is pushing him down the stairs as revenge
I guess it kinda spoils the entire story but there is a fic that ends like that. . >!You're Back, Mari!<
Oh I saw that, accepted the other ending as headcanon tho
I mean. . Mari’s had a minute
Well in turkish, weed have same mean with marij**na
This is also in the normal route. >!(Throwing Shoes to a Power Line has a few meanings from what I got but I think this is about Mari's death [Memorial to someone who died])!<
Oh i see that makes sense too
>!mari got smoked by her opps in the faraway hood !<
But...that is obvious, come on even the name is from Mari's piano.. . I'm sorry if that sounded a bit obnoxious to someone.. . And to finish.....Omori.
That's because Kim is her best friend, and the first friend she made after Mari died and everyone split.

I guess Mari now has a Mansion, (with an elevator!)
>!Guess the violin is not so expensive for Mari after all!<
That actually sounds like a good theory dude good job .
Thanks!
It really is masterfully done, isn't it? I was listening to the OST and noticed that a lot of the piano pieces are done in 3/4 time, i.e waltz time - >!waltzes are supposed to be MARI's favorite piano pieces, and the Duet at the end of the true ending is a waltz!<
Also in the song it begins with the piano, and then it’s the duet, and it ends with the violin, almost like it’s an allegory for Mari and Sunny’s life.
Man, and I thought I couldnt get any more sadder ;-;
But why? This would be a GOOD THING. XD
Its a good happy kind of sad?? idk how to explain it just touches me in the feels man
Bittersweet
That's one of the main arguments in favor of "friends forgive". I like it.
I noticed the flowers at the end (the Gladiolus os there, just a bit hidden behind the others), but I didn't connected it to such an idea! . . I like it, it's really hopeful and ends the dark game on a bright note :)
Aaaaand I am crying.
A pretty plausible theory man.  It's been a long time since I've been so emotionally invested in any piece of media. Left me drained and wanting more. I honestly get teary eyed just thinking about the game.
IKR? I need to play something happy and uplifting next
This a fucking good idea, great job dude
oh my god yo this is so smart?!! thank you for fixing my heart now im gonna believe this.
this is genius
The fact that Lilly of The Valley is my favorite flower LSHDOSHOWJDPDNSLSNW I C A N ‘ T. . But this makes me happy because at least they are all still friends after that
I'm slightly surprised people missed this, this image hit me like a truck after crying on and off through this game.. . It was a bittersweet relieving cry at this, realizing they were finally able to understand her death and find peace with each other.. . I literally sobbed out "they went back to the stump".. . It never crossed my mind for a moment that they wouldn't forgive them, the catharsis at knowing the truth that Mari was happy and that Sunny and Basil could unshoulder their burden, would've been the greatest thing, in my mind.. . I've never been so screwed up over a character in anything. I felt the burden of not understanding why someone so happy could leave in such a way.. . . Great catch on all the flowers and pinwheel! I didn't see every flower.. . . You can probably tell I just finished it haha.. . Also Aubrey put her pinwheel there as a sign of acceptance and healing so I think that supports your theory too.. . I thought everything throughout the good ending pointed to nothing but a future with them all together.
> I thought everything throughout the good ending pointed to nothing but a future with them all together.. . Right? It kills me that the final scene cut out right before we saw their reaction.
Wow someone did this before I did 
And dyed her hair in honor of Mari!
About that, i believe that's Mari's spirit.. . It's not possible to Hero and Sunny being hauted by the same thing, hearing the same song, at the same time. So i believe it was literally Mari's spirit playing the piano.
Great interpretation!. . As stated in another comment, I like considering different points of view in art so I was considering a more down-to-earth interpretation too!. . If you want my personal interpretation: I think Sunny was attracted to the piano room by something (Not Something, but something like an itch he had from slowly dealing with the truth) and there he hallucinated Mari, >!the reason Mari isn't "Something" in this case is that the context in which she appears is something Sunny thought was beautiful, considering how he looks at Mari when playing the Duet. So he started hearing the song she practiced. I've heard of people hallucinating a loved one's voice or something that represents them when mourning so it fits!< . Then Hero's big bro instincts noticed Sunny wasn't sleeping so he went look for him; when he headed downstairs and to the piano room, considering he never got over >!Mari's death!<, he also heard her song.
i thought it meant he was the piano from super (mari)o 64
The haunted one?. . oh shoot
More traumatic than the game imo
Hikikomori specifically means shut in to the point of not participating in society as a whole for long periods of time (6+ months), which Mari definitely isn't.
That ring on the left hand tho!
Mari married to Hero is all I see.. . That world is good.
And Mari is 15.
This is the adult Mari from the NOMORI timeline.
Ohhh okay.
>!XY ghost girl explained, no clickbait!!<
Mari is alive but in another world.
>!Stair Isekai!<
That's right XD
"Tourist Mari"  . . . Make sure she stays away from the stairs exhibit
Omori fans when they see a person named like a character from their funny game Omori
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
Yo she got isekai'd frm the stairs
She got isekaied
You know what the best part is? You don't even need to buy the plush, *because it's already inside your walls.*
*Hellmari is no longer inside your walls. You have been spared!* 
It’s not in the walls, it’s behind you now
*I know! Say hi, Hellmari!* 
. . Hello.
Aw, hi! 
Same
It’s just like me fr
Wait, what? 
Don’t you hear the breathing? 
*...yes...* 
Then you know what’s up . . r u n ;)
The sky, ofc! . . I think I'll walk instead. 
Would buy anyway.
Same tbh
make her point at something and she’ll be soyjack Mari
I love it. . >!so long as it's kept far, far away from me!<
. . >!She is sad!<

ngl i almost forgot this was supposed to be a horror game until this post
Horror?? In MY shipping simulator???
😋
r/Oddlyterrifying
this is absolutely horrifying
I didn’t want to sleep anyway
Not my proudest fap /s
😰😰😰

I thought it said in the photo album that Sunny's dad hated Hero for dating Mari. . &#x200B;. . . . >(2/18 - MY BIRTHDAY): MARI and HERO fell asleep on the couch. They look so cozy together... Hehe... I hope they don't mind the photo. MARI's dad might be kind of mad if he saw it...
i don't think it's hate, so much as it is worry/(over)concern about his daughter dating someone he may not know - and this potentially being behind his back.
Oh okay
Mari is definitelly tge one on the right of OMORI
Really? How do you figure that?
Bigger feet, brighter, and also she is his sister. . How did you find this post now? Lol
143 corresponds to the number of letters to spell "I love you", and there's a blackspace room where Mari repeatedly says "I love you" and you wait 143 seconds to unlock a secret so I think it's referencing that
And defenestration is specifically "throwing someone out a window". Mari was pushed down the stairs. Completely different.
Definitely not. 143 = I Love You. I = 1 letter. Love = 4 letters. You = 3 letters. It is the reason why May 23rd is Mari’s birthday though. 143’d day of the year
Cool. Now, can someone explain to me why Mari in the AU is called Hikiko? Is it because it's the brand from the violin? 😅
Other half of the word Hikkikomori, I suppose
Its definitely just that. That's where "omori" comes from in the first place
Thanks 👍
I thought the red hands represent "the hands which pushed Mari"
>!sorta wish there was a ghost Mari plush tho!<
C'MON THAT HAS TO BE MARI
Exactly how I explained (Using Mari's dialog as example)
As Mari says . . >"Expand your mind, OMORI! I need to set an example for my ***sometimes-boring*** little brother!" . . Sounds like a way of saying that Omori has a boring taste to me.
Most of my points happen before everything with Mari though
I can't remember ever reading a line about Mari hurting herself with a knife? Where does that come from?
SPOILERS BELOW! ALTHOUGH YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS GOING INTO THIS THREAD!. . What a ride this game was. With great laughs and uplifting moments from going through the Vast Forest to diving into the depths of the Deepest Well. And the final hours where the sense of dread just kept coming in harder as The Truth was revealed. The devs did great with the final battle with Omori as kept yourself going with the hopes and support of your friends only to succumb at the end when hammered with the Truth that you had killed Mari. Leaving it to you, the player whether you wanted to continue on despite what you had done.. . The scenes you get after you beat Omori were devastating for me as it rolls through the flashbacks with Mari and Sunny as infants then going to the present day.. . It may have taken us longer then was planned for us to finally play through this game but I think it was well worth it.. . Edit: Honorable mention goes to Aubrey's Headbutt attack whose animation alone had me keep that as a skill for her till the end of the game for me. Finishing off a boss with that move made me giggle without fail.. . Edit 2: Also want to make the note that we were ROBBED of the fight against Pluto's final form. The only disappointment I felt with this game as we were denied of the glorious battle with this chad of a planet.
i think that scene was just simbolism about his guilt for the mari thing, the cat died from natural causes, i think this bc the "butler cat" in the room is omori's view of a doctor/veterinary as we can se in one of his drawings in the sketchbook where the butler cat takes care of the sick omori in bed
no??? he wasn't smiling in any of the pictures, and he definitely didn't mean to kill mari.
If he was smiling, it was because he was disassociating. If you read the captions for the black space photo album (not available in the main game, but available through datamining / available on the discord sheet) it's clear when he dragged her up the stairs he was convinced all she needed was some rest and everything would be okay. It was definitely an accident and he convinced himself she would be okay.
I think the truth refers to Mari's death - which was an accident, and a staged suicide.
My interpretation of the "stop it" is that that's what Mari said when blocking Sunny from going down the stairs right before she got pushed.. . (Also this is a little unrelated, but the other day I found out that the blurry texture covering the screen in phase 5 (start of the video) is actually a bunch of the smiling Hellmaris from the Red Maze. I always thought it was just water drops or something...)
They're hanging out with Mari LMAO
By your side
Those aren't hanging maris, its his friends.
Those aren’t Maris behind him, those are his friends.
this is an interesting take, but after mari got pushed down the stairs, omori put her into her bed and waited for her to wake up, and she didn’t. so she pretty much was dead at that point. i think the eye thing was mostly a way to hint at Something being mari. . cool idea tho :)
But why the Eye though also she was paralyzed so even if she wanted to get up she would be able to
In the game the dad i think actually knows what sunny did to mari Because there adults and in the blackspace theres a scene where a person(Sunny's dad) stands near a tree assuming its where mari got hanged and the dad repeat the word "you are not my son" i think it means how did sunny kill mari and make it look like a suicide and the friends dint know they thought its suicide because there kids and they were never corrected of her true death and they haven't seen maris actually corpse only the embalmed one
Ohh, that'd make sense.
Oh btw they dint found out about the violin got broken
Probably forensic experts told him Mari didnt die by falling but by asphyxia also Sunny's mom saying I won't lose my only son aswell we got pretty strong evidences
but the problem is the game didn't tell any about Mari was impaled by broken parts of the violin. even, there is no say about her wound scar.
It's purposely left ambiguous.
Sorry for the late comment but I was thinking about this today. So, firstly if she broke her neck that is a common way to die after hanging yourself, infact that is the goal of it. So if she did break her neck that's probably why a health professional would pass it off. . . HOWEVER there is text in the game files associated with the pictures, and after she falls Mari is said to look like she's sleeping. Eyes closed. But once she is hung her eyes are suddenly open, and her face wasn't looked at once when she was being pulled from downstairs to the backyard. So I think it's almost confirmed that she woke up while being taken to the backyard and killed once she was hung...
That's creepy af. Honestly, I don't want to think that happened just because I don't want the boys to feel any more guilt than they already do. But, once again, you never know. That could definitely be what happened. Way too creepy for me, though.
A little bit late but what I think really sells this case is that Mari's eyes are stressed. In death, when your eyes open it's because the muscles relax. The fact that the eyes are drawn stressed (lines zoning in on the iris) indicates that her nervous system reacted. Just a theory though, could just be creative choice.
I was thinking the same thing, honestly that makes the story 3x sadder though
My Option Idea is: >!she died and was buried. but What If, she miraculously came back alive. I think, she will make an attempted to break the tomb box, and push the dirt above herself up, next, she out of the grave, then use dirt to fill in the hole(she didn’t want anyone to know herself was still alive yet), and after that, she fled to a somewhere place to survive...!<. . >!how about the eye thing(i mean dark, shadowy figure. It has one vertical eye) if Mari alive, did this thing will appear? generally to say is no possible appear, because Mari is alive. but I choose to count in that eye thing(dark, shadowy figure. It has one vertical eye). I believe is the same at last, when Sonny told his friends the truth about Mary's death. that eye thing(dark, shadowy figure. It has one vertical eye) will disappear. !<. . >!What if Mary is lucky enough to survive these 4 years? What will happen to her next? I do not know. But I might think, she until on one day to meet again or be discovered by her friends or family? Or someone else outside...!<. . (I know this will become an argument. But this is a What-If Scenario. That's just hypothetical and alternative ideas. No need to be too serious. You can criticize my idea as wrong, but please respect it.)
I would think it is impossible. But this one is about another secret ending with good ending.
a body would have decomposed by then
child makes no sense
This is my opinion : PLS TEACH YOUR CHILDREN CALL 911
They knew, the point is that if they called, their parents would know it was their fault
It can be true, as we saw Mari didn't had any blood and there wasn't any signs that Mari is 100% dead, as we could see in the pictures, there were only few scars.
This has to be true we have the evidence and and they are just children. How were they supposed to know if she was alive or not this has to be true. . (Or ots just my soul telling me "there had to be a betterway for this")
Which makes the theory even more plausible as maris eyes were closed after the stairs then they opened when they hung her, meaning she actually died when she was hung, not the stairs
I genuinely believe Mari was still alive before they hung her she was paralyzed but alive
I think Mari was alive before hanging it's possible   because  of two thing why should someone like Basile  have more truma  and stress  more then sunny and the game didn't said any thing about  the pulse  of heart  and the last thing if she had died  becuse of falling  down of stairs why no one suspected  that some one killed  her guys we just Need think outside  of box 
This was a fan theory???. . Edit: Oops, 4 year old thread.
id like to believe that too
i am glad someone else thought of this,too. i dont use reddit often but if i didnt find this post or others regarding it i'd've had to make a post of my own.. . &#x200B;. . that was my immediate thought was..
Honestly I find this whole theory to just be needlessly gruesome for no reason considering there is no evidence she was alive when she was hung. Thankfully in the console release the devs disprove it themselves by having a sleeping omori and Mari and the mari one says she is not breathing.
The game tries really hard for you to believe that white Mari is not just a hallucination without explicitly saying it.. . For example, the old guy in the cemetery claims that if you had seen the things he had seen, you'd believe in spirits too. The one time white Mari appears in the dream, she clearly behaves differently from Headspace's Mari, which doesn't make much sense if she was just a figment of Sunny's Imagination (she even says she's lonely and that's why she came, but she shouldn't have). There's also the one time we see Basil's grandma in the middle of the crossroad, just after she died in the hospital.
Bruh it's supposed to be Mari. I drew it to be Mari.
It was >!Mari's corpse after she got accidentally pushed down the stairs!<
The police would probably avoid asking them about signs of Mari being suicidal though, and they had no reason to tell the police on their own. Also, someone else being suicidal is not an easy thing to detect, even with the signs, especially if they lack education about the more subtle signs of a suicidal person, so it would not be unreasonable that they would not pick up on it.
The police had full reason to ask them, as I said before, any reasonable person would question Mari’s death, so they would probably launch a small investigation. Now, they might not ask her friend’s first, they’ll probably ask her parents (and don’t say ‘they wouldn’t do that’…it’s their job to do so, it’s certainly difficult, but it’s in the name of justice) and then get someone else to interrogate Sunny (it depends on which state they live in though).
The police typically wouldn’t look any deeper unless there was a strong possibility of a murder. While Mari might have sustained small injuries, since she died by a broken neck which seemed to have been caused by the hanging, those small injuries would not be much of a factor, since there already appears to be an obvious cause of death not involving those injuries.
The difference is that Mari would be actively trying to hide it and appear happy, as she would want to be seen as this perfect girl who had no issues going on. This would make it much more difficult to detect issues with her, which could provide an explanation.
Like I said, you can’t hide certain things when you feel the way you do. That’s just human psychology. Body language, little ticks, or just a ‘vibe’ that someone gives off. I don’t care if Mari acted like the happiest person on earth, if anyone that said they cared about her just looked and thought about her for a second, they would know if she was okay or not. . . . That’s not being a psychology expert, that’s just caring about others. Let put this in a simple quote:. . . “A person’s silence always speaks louder than words.”
Unfortunately, it’s much easier said than done. When people aren’t paying close attention for possible signs, they often fail to notice of any signs, and any signs that are noticed are unrecognized and forgotten. And people aren’t mind readers, they can’t always tell when something’s wrong with someone. This is especially true if, as I said earlier, the person in question appears to be happy and “perfect.” Otherwise, almost all teen suicides would have been prevented if their friends and family, especially their parents, were able to easily tell when something was wrong.
Okay…we’ve been going at this all day and I don’t think either of us is getting close to convincing the other. So how about this? We agree to disagree. I got my personal belief on what happened to make of this senseless situation, and you got yours. Honestly, I think talking about teen suicide, psychology, how much of Mari’s blood actually got cleaned, etc., kinda wares you down for a while, and this is just going nowhere.. . . At the end of the day, I don’t think we’ll ever know what happened afterwards. The game is full of assumptions and plot holes for the player to fill. We don’t know how Mari would adapt to having suicidal thoughts or how her friends would react, cause she didn’t have any (as far as we know)! We don’t know jack about the Faraway Police department (if they even have their own police), for all we know it could range a number of just the two cops from Monster House to a full-on NYC squad that has all the elite equipment and gear. They could autopsy the body, but also not. They could investigate further, or not. It’s all left up to interpretation, because at the end of the day, Omocat wasn’t trying to create a ‘Law and Order’ episode. . . . But this was definitely an interesting discussion, I enjoy delving into this kind of stuff…but I’m also tired.
What I’m saying is, the police would probably need to determine a timeline of events. It’s based on what little evidence there is and what the final result is, a Mari hanging from a tree with wounds that indicate that she fell down the stairs.. . . So, let’s say they take the most broad guess:. . . “Mari was either pushed or accidentally fell from the bottom of the stairs, an unknown person came into the picture (and for some reason), dragged her outside and hung her from the tree.”. . . Now, why would someone hang a person from a tree when that person fell down the stairs? We know better, but they don’t, so they would say either ‘because they pushed her and didn’t want to get blamed’, or ‘she accidentally fell, and the person who’s worried they’ll get blamed for her death’, or something along those lines (considering that the person doing this is just a normal person and not a sister-killing psycho). . . . And the thing about staircase injures, it’s pretty noticeable. You’re gonna have cuts, bruises, broken bones, etc., those are things that you don’t get from a hanging, those are things you get from falling down a staircase. I know it doesn’t say it in the game, but that’s what happens in real life to real staircase fall victims. . . . The point is, they would rule out suicide VERY quickly, because it just doesn’t make sense with her injuries. Maybe they could end up on accidental, but that still makes them question who was this other person…and take a wild guess who they’re going to guess first. . . . They don’t even need to know the violin exists until they get to the ‘why’ of the situation, I’m saying they can deduce it with simple logic.
maybe is just Beta Mari or another sister.
that was kinda expectable, half the fandom just hates him bcs he >!hung Mari!<
yeah ik that he hung mari
But he still my boy
(no homo)
Mari would be very good at fall guys.
I saw Mari in Medbay
>!mari's cookie or pizza would be a good idea!<
>!Ayo the pizza here (Haha funny joke)!<
but on my other though, >!her "came out of nowhere" food from omori may be a good idea!<
Nooioiiiioooooooooooo >!mari dont fall!<
>!I hate to break it to you, but you're like 4 years too late!<
Oh well thats normal cuz i didnt have reddit 4 years ago
How the fuck has this only just appeared in my inbox 2 years later
Hello fellow mari fan
archduke franz was assassinated. he is dead. >!mari is dead. mari is from omori, just like kel!<
Dang it you got me
İ like mari alot ita like my whole personality rn idk
Mari got pushed down the stairs.
That one Wario player that takes too long to roll even the dice on Mario Party Superstars
>!Jump rope x Mari’s neck!<
>!Mari x stairs!<
The ship name for that is >!ayo pizza here!< 
Talking about mari
I'm saying that it would be wierd for MARI to have a masculine voice
Oh well that was confusing (Plus wth is wrong with a masculine female??????)
It's-a me! A-Mari!
Itsa me Mari… ohhh.
Wait, what will this do to all the mario kart rainbow roads? 
Mari, what have you done?
Im helping people destroy omori.
Mate I don’t remember asking for your opinion. 
It's not a story that MARI would tell you.
I wonder if this means a possible Mari plushy is still coming out………
*still no mari plush though....*
i know they say life is unfair… but this? 
At this point she's releasing plushies of everyone but Mari just to spite us.
Hoping and praying RN for a >!Abbi and Spirit Mari!< plush
mari : all it cost is your sanity and mental health
I mean >!I'm pretty sure Mari wasn't cremated!<
She is now
The true enemy is Mari/j
LET'S KILL MARI FOR A CANONIC JOKE
Who you gonna call? Mari!
MARIII???  . . . oh right is >!dead!<
>!Sunny... You have to forgive yourself... It's not your fault...!<. . -Mari
im not >!dead!< im right here!

Happy cake day!
:)
HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!
:)
HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!
ty :)
waiting for something to happen?
i like the little addition right before they disappear into oblivion, basil becomes stranger and i think mari becomes ghost mari
I noticed that Basil turned into stranger,mari into spirit mari,hero was smiling before he died and omori looked at mari and then locked back to the front before he died
Yeah. I think that for an artist to get support via upvotes, they'd need to have more than just the art itself. There needs to be more than another drawing of \[insert character\]. Usually that would be an interesting scenario, something "new" / rare to see, or in the case of Kewl; interesting artistic choices. Like an artist can spend hours drawing Mari, but it won't get attention because it's just Mari and nothing else. Which is unfortunate. Attention only comes if you call for it.
You get it. . 
Yeah actually I read a lot about things like this. This happens everywhere with practically everything. Speeches need a good hook, articles online need a clickable title, YouTube videos need good thumbnails, etc. The initial reaction determines if it get's attention, and once it captures attention that's when people support. I don't min-max my art since I don't really care about upvotes, but I would suggest that people look into ways to have good attention getters for their art.
They way you explained it makes it extremely disappointing to the point where actual good art of a character in this subreddit gets less upvotes than art that is actually eye catching (for example, meme art posts or putting the characters in some outfit) it’s honestly really sad. You explained it really well.
Ey, what can I say? I'm a psychology nerd! I research this stuff for fun 
thats a wonderful gif
MARI!!! I didn't know you could speak spanish
I’m Mexican that’s why 
oh that's nice, love from italyt5\31hpy:2463
Eh it’s not surprising the png is probably more eye catching then the Mari picture as lame as it sounds.. . People appreciate different things. I awarded the artist that made the mari post so hopefully they don’t feel to bad about it. . . I don’t know how to explain this to you. People don’t care about how much heart or soul you put into something they’re just looking for results.  . . I see post like this every once and awhile. I always wonder why people are surprised by stuff like this.
what about it is more eyecatching?
Well you see here mari doesn't have a cool gradient background
Nah, we need a Hellmari flair now. 

>!**MARI did the Default Dance!**!<
Wait people are attacking Kewl? Her art is really well done, and like he already walks around in a pink apron in the game lol, I kinda think >!that if she had lived!< Mari would have totally made him wear a maid dress or something lol
We should probably start a new meme trend so people will just get over the drama concerning everybody... . . Something like "Mari is the director of Hamilton"
Sunny (real world) also wears maris clothes.. he took the outfit of the one you see of headspace mari
This isnt true. You can see Mari wearing those headspace clothes in real world pictures aswell. . Sunny has his own clothes thankfully
oh god what kind of unholy thing is marina creating now
i want to become mari
Alright. . ****shoves you****
I wanna be mari
Annnnd meanwhile the 1000000th >!Mari falling down the staircase memes!< gets 100s. . . . To be fair tho, that’s just Reddit, memes generally are shown more often than actual art. Luckily, I don’t really create stories for attention or for others, I create stories for myself.
Marianne from FE three houses
I’m assuming when he was like 15 he hated it, but by the time he’s 19 he’s more disciplined and has a routine to keep himself healthy and in shape. >!perhaps it started as one of the things he did to try to keep himself from falling back into the depressive spiral after Maris death!<
Okay first,she did died when she was first downstairs,have you ever wondered why Hellmari has a difformed neck ? It broke at the impact of her on the stairs.. . . Second,Sunny deep regret afterwards,and kind of made his good and bad deeds equals in the Sunny route where he helps his former friends rebuild their bonds and overall improve their life,also saving Basil from going deeper into his depression and indirectly saving him.. . . Third,Mari also could have been a much darker person from a theory,at the beginning of the game,when basil assimilates mari to a certain flower,turns out this flower in the flower language means that a person seems perfect on the outside, but hides a default who can be huge or minor.. Maybe his sister Mari was really mean to him, or at least not Always soft with him.
You know who has the most similar expressions to Mari? >! Something. !<
Too soon, I think.
That's pretty cool! They should've used the Mari portraits in game
is ghost maris "serious" sprite ever used in game?
Ok now give us Mari JoJo Face
Why does mari in some pics have white eyes?
Huh, I guess they don't want any *ahem* "conversations" on that matter, plus I think it was about something, not mari
Okay
Yeah and Mari was a Minor too 
NOOOO THEY FOUND OUT
You even look like Mari! 
NO I DONT
You do 

 <- Mari. .  <- Kewl
 (This is canon now.)
Wait is mari back?
:hi lost sister/j

:
Aaaawww, what a wholesome sibling reunion
Mari, if that's really you lemme ask you a question. . . >! How tf did you revived? !<
 >! Oh I never died. My "death" was just a way for my darling brother to learn about the consequences of his actions !<. . 
>!can confirm!<

omo on her way to do everything but release a spirit mari plush:
Listen guys Mari is just gone at this point. I guess omo trys to make it game accuratet5\31hpy:2462 still mad
Tbf she could just come out and explain to us instead of just saying "She's dead lol". Plus, wouldn't be the first time we get RW/spirit Mari merch
They be doing ANYTHING , BUT giving mari a new plushie
Alright, I know it’s random, and rabbits already exist in OMORI, but am I the only one who noticed we still have rabbit merch, aka Ai, that lines up with the end of Oshi no Ko ?. . So, we almost get Ai merch, who has nothing to do with OMORI, before anything for Mari.. . OMOCAT really doesn’t seem to care about Mari, huh ?. . 
Comments reenacted meet the spy with adjustments to fit the context of MARI
i would say a joke about kewl being mari but they already admitted that

I am Mari
You am Mari
He am Mari
We am Mari

I just love Mari she is my favorite character 
Agree
Anyone from the Silmarillion fandom here?
Yes Mari, you are New school gamer
Hello!!!!! WOw its mari omori!!!!
That implies that they're siblings (jk)
. . Never mind he’s to sad because it’s Sprit Mari 🥲 (He misses her to much..)
Where’s the Muslim Mari person?
Exactly!!!! u/IslaamNogood is one of my favorites!! I thought they would be here a lot more!. . 

I vote for her too !
Smells Like Mari Spirit
If someone makes a plushie of this Mari, I would buy it!. . 
Hmm..... . 
Mari tell me…are you really Yuri’s and Sayori’s secret love child or something?
. . Maybe this is why Sunny and Mari's parents are never seen in game!!!  . (Also hi, you're one of my favourite commenters!)
HOMOPHOBIC FAMILY PORTRAIT
A coil-head and bracken combo? You are not getting out of this alive my friend.. . >!The coil-head is actually Mari!<
The art is based around a real game session and there were actually two coilheads and also a thumper.. .  About spoiler: HAHAHAH. I didn't really think about it when I was drawing this.
Bad ending in hikimari au
Mari!
Mari approves 
Before I saw hands I thought that it was a staircase in the dark
Same
thank god i wasnt the only one
Same here 
Same
Double meaning??
same
Your gonna make us all cry again
sry
Omg I thought the piano was stairs
It looks like that scene at the start lmao
Oh my God I thought it was a staircase I was terrified
Oooh this is so pretty!! Hopefully ill learn it too sometime its so pretty 
thank you!
Nicely done and now time for being sad
thanks and sorry lol
does your house have stairs?. . Just curious
yes but thankfully it is just two steps so I think I'm safe
Or so you think
>!Let’s see then!..!<
get ready

A
Tirenl@ de una escalera
nooo
Cool, now fall down the stairs
If that's so... lets fulfil everything ElSE that happened to Mari

...Do you have a little brother who plays the violin?
gladly no
Same, but worse 
:)
Be wary of staircases
Now I’m just upset I’m not that good
thank you! and don't be upset it just takes practice ;)
🍕
😢
ima come back in like 4 years when im good with my violin and duet this ;)
remindme! 4 years
Be careful of stairs
I know how to play literally everything else in Duet except that part lmao
Awesome! I’ve been trying to learn final duet myself but a much much simplified version since I’ve never done piano before, it’s so fun learning it though. Hopefully I’ll work my way up to playing as well as you though!
thank you! I've been playing for just 7 months now, so I'm not that experienced aswell, I'm sure you can do it!. . if you want to, [this]() is the video I used for learning it
Thanks! I’ve been using a similar kind of video, I’ll definitely try with that one though! At first I thought my experience reading notes/tab for guitar a decade ago might transfer over but nah, those videos are lifesavers
. . It’s sounds beautiful btw
thanks!. . edit: lol i just saw the image
😭
Are you dead?
maybe
I play violin
I've started learning piano three weeks ago.. . Whenever I mess up, I would do my best to perfect it.. . My younger sibling bought a violin, but is hesitant to learn.. . My knee started to randomly hurt.. . Am I gonna die soon?
Does it make you dead?
maybe inside
I want to play this But my fingers are not cooperating with me 
thanks!
Now fall off the stairs
spoiler?. . also nice
Before your hands I thought that was the bottom of a staircase
Flash back to omori game play:
nicely done, great job! 
thank you!
I LOVE FINAL DUET I LOVE PIANO GREAT JOB!!!!!!
thanks!
Hi mari I'm stairs
I'll file a restraining order on you
🗿📶
Stairs
Fucking shit I thought the piano was a staircase
You will fall down a set of stairs soon.. . . *The universe has decided.*
As Mari…. . I can confirm she has all the requirements to become me.
thanks for confirming
You’re welcome!
Come and see.. It's a particularly calming track that is probably one of the most interesting tracks in >!black space, considering the name I'd say based on the acoustics trailing off and stuff this song represents sunny dealing with mari's perfectionism, every wrong note makes him have to trail back for mari's sake, but it keeps happening. Considering the truth about mari was stemmed from that perfectionist ideal, and if this is in the unfiltered subconscious, then it's probably the musical version of sunny's frustration!<
That piano sounds absolutely amazing. Mari would be proud 
just like mariiiiiii-
Final duet or Maris theme
Mari has priority but all are excellent 😌
mari
Oh hell nah is Mari listening to Swans 😭
mari listening to soundtracks for the blind is insane
mari
Mari or omori
MARI IS GETTING AUX SO HARD. I LOVE JEFF BUCKLEY AND RADIOHEAD.
Mari is basically my spotify
For some reason I feel like Mari would be the type of person that would listen to Laura Branigan.. (specifically Gloria)
My guy please for the love of Mari share the tab and or chords; that rendition was amazing.
Op said they play by ear, so they don't have the tab or chords
>!GOES HARDER THAN MARI HITTING THE GROUND 🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️!<
The beat dropped harder than Mari down the stairs.
keep it up :)
So beautiful! sounds great :D
Imagine you play this at a talent show or something like that and the couple of kids in the back who played the game are just bawling their eyes out
There were no mistakes. Just happy little accidents.
sounds great!
>!”better have no mistakes bitch” - Mari 5 seconds before the pizza was there!<
To add to this, the scream plays around the minute ''1:49'', ''149'' is a leifmotif used often through that game that means ''I love you'', a phrase that's related to Mari.. . And on the unused dialog from the photo album, on the photo when Mari and Sunny are fighting on top of the staircase (''Photo of a fight'') it says *''MARI blocked your path. She says that she isn't finished talking. She tells you not to run away...''*. . So the voice saying ''Hey! I'm not-'' is probably saying her saying what says on the photo, but it gets cut directly to the scream.
absolute perfection. wait>!thats why mari died!<
No because they locked in and basically became Mari with how good it was
HAHA
Were there any stairs nearby
Damn, that beat hits harder than >!Mari hits the floor !<
crazy
r/beatmetoit
*You are suddenly overcome with sadness and guilt for some unknown reason.*
this is so rad! maris version of the title screen was always better imo
Yes! I love the arrangement
Awesome arrangement, do u have the keys for this?
Absolutely. Here they are:. G. AQDE . (DC) GJ . Q (AWQ) S D . GT D E D . (RX) V N S F H (AZ). T C E . (RX) V N S D F H N. T (QJ) . (WZ) C B M D DG. R B J (QZ). . (XX) means play them at the same time and when theres no space between noted means tou press them fast one after the other. Have fun :)
Alright tysm keep it up
thank you!
Ooh thanks, I might try to transpose this for the clarinet cause I play the clarinet and this might be fun to play!
Fantastic, I’ve been wanting to play some Omori osts on the lyre since I saw it
This is amazing! If you plan on doing more I'd love to hear a cover of the Lost Library theme
Funny because i thought of doing this one after By Your Side which i'm currently practicing!
Ooh, best of luck!
Doing God's work here. Love it. I hope you'll do more!
Thabk you! I'm actually probably going to post By your side tonight, i'm getting pretty good at it
Can't wait! It's 1 am here, so I'll definitely check it out tomorrow!

The ending got me, xD. Idk if it was intentional or not, but you managed to hit some of the right notes in the end. Anyway, well done! It's good to see you are making progress. If you'll end up posting another video, I'll be watching it.
The ending is not completely intentional, I was actually that frustrated. It's on me though, I played the piano for longer than an hour and the fatigue was getting to me. And as I have already mentioned, I can play the entire piece now, but there will be hiccups here and there. I want to minimize those hiccups as much as I possibly can.
I do have a younger sibling lol
Well, hiccups aside. You're playing was pretty great. Those hiccups at the end were low-key hilarious. I was totally reminded of Mari playing the wrong notes video, which I'm assuming was the point. Lol. . 
Yes, that was kind of the point lul
As a Pianist and an older sister, should I also learn this?
Whatever you do don’t get your little sibling into violin 🙏
Yeah that's right, the core of the problem is Sunny being a violinist, not Mari being so obsessive and passionate about her work that it destroyed her and everyone around her
>She was perfectly fine overworking herself. She’s the type who enjoys practicing over and over. Is it healthy? Probably not. But she was far from destroying herself.. . Overworking oneself is destroying oneself, in my opinion. And I do not think she practices over and over just because she enjoys it mostly. I think she practices to such a degree because she fears that people would stop liking her if she weren't as perfect as she had always been. Getting Sunny involved only escalate the situation to the point it resulted in Mari's death due to Mari now overworking herself and her brother. But the signs of Maru's deterioration as a person were already there, at least shown during the 'Mari is home' of the Black Space segment in the base game. At least that is how I think about the matter.
As long as you focus on playing the piece all the way through instead of trying to perfect it to the point you will never have any more hiccups, feel free to.
Why the top of the piano looks like FNAF 4 Menu screen?
It does haha, but it's accidental. The piano's top cover and the camera angle makes it look like so.
We all know the real Mari would slam her head on the keys every time she made a small mistake
Okay, that's just an exaggeration really, I don't think Mari would be THAT much of a perfectionist.
I love playing this but no one i play it to gives a shit about it.
That's their lost, I think
What grade would you say the piece is?
It probably belongs to Grade 6 or 7, I think. A little out of league at first for me, but somehow I actually managed to play it. I couldn't believe it myself.
You sound amazing!! :D
Thank you :D
me fr
Hope you don't have a brother who knows violin
.... . I'm doomed.
Again, just don't be hiding your frustrations and difficulties from him and you will be okay
fuck, I do that, welp, guess I'll die.. . 
If you are still alive, it's not too late still. Be the change you want to see.
I thought you were playing that way to get mad and mimic her perfectionist personality but you're just learning 🤣🤣🤣 keep trying, you're very good
I wasn't acting mad, I was ACTUALLY mad
Yeah yeah, I know. Playing an instrument can be infuriating asf. I also get mad when I want to keep playing the guitar but my fingers hurt too much
Maybe this is why Mari was so mean to Sunny on the days leading up to the recital
Don't be too hard with your friends or you may end >!downstairs too!<
hey, it sounds great already. I insist :D
Thanks man
Something but it has Mari's cheerful personality and makes you laugh to forget about the pain
Look, a leaked sound track for Rainy Mari - an Omori mod! 0-0. . Irrespective of that though, phenomenal playing from you. The lack of violin can serve as a deliberate artistic choice if it was played in an Omari AU mod, at roughly where you would expect to hear it.
Thank you. Damn, this is a huge compliment, though I cant take the credit from the original.
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee - Mari probably
I like it, but it seems like your hand is slightly twitching. Try to relax a bit instead.. . Additionally, I'd hold down the right pedal so that my right hand can prematurely leave to hit the lower chord.. . Additionally, try to play legato, so that it lessens the space between the notes.. . Adding crescendo to measure 1 and diminuendo to measure 3 would add to the overall piece.. . Try playing mezzopiano at measure 4.. . Other than that, good job! You'd make Mari proud 
Spinnileaf's piano skills are now making me more convinced that this is Mari from an alternate universe that has somehow landed in our dimension.. . Nice try Mari, but I've got you.
"Wait, so it's all *By Your Side?*". . *"Always have been."*. . *mari racks her SIG-Sauer MG338 belt-fed General-Purpose Machine Gun chambered in .338 Norma Magnum*
that's kinda overkill
The best kind of kill.. . You know what they said: "There's no kill like overkill."
Y E S
this is just beautiful. thank you
😁
You think that's bad, I'm 26 and Mari is taller than me
I'm 13 and I'm somehow taller than all  of you
Real world Mari >!is -6’!<
YOU DIDNT
I literally made a mari plush by hand just to hang it from my tree

Its still there after over a year
you... you are a despicable being.
Im not the one hanging from a cherry blossom so im winning
Haha that made me spit my water
Post a picture of it lol
When i get back home
U got home yet?
The noose broke
Flair checks out

It’s going to be okay
One question. WHY?
sigma male grindset

........oh!

Why do I have to see this comment again after I saw the exact same comment, related to this height chart?
Bruh, low blow.
Just like the bottom of the stairs
STOP STOP SHES ALREADY DEAD!
Beat me to it
[You shut the fuck up >:((((((]()
Violation 😭

Wouldn't she be... a bit higher up
I was gonna respond to this later but id hate to leave you hanging
LMAO💀💀💀
Ik this is hella old but Idc . . Atleast you werent shorter than Mari ;:sobs:;
That's such a cool chart.  Hmm, I wonder why the older version of Mari isn't there.
Thank you! I know you meant this as a joke, but here's my attempt at finding older Mari's height. Depending on how she's standing, she might be closer to 5'8 or 5'7. 
Mari: -6 feet
Every Real World character is taller than I am :( (Even DW Mari is taller lol)
Real world Mari: -6FT
My sense of humor is fucked, lol. I thought of them putting Mari's grave next to dw Mari, and putting "6ft under". 🥲
RW Mari and DW Mari are basically the same since they're both 15.
heh. almost made a silly goof. was about to ask “what’s maris real world height?” hahaha…
Where is hell mari’s height. . I need it
I know how to measure the height of mari . . . . . . How tall are stairs?
Where’s real world Mari?
Why is there only one mari? I hope she’s okay!
where's real world Mari hmm??? 🤨🤨🤨
Mari. -6’
Wait why is there only one mari?!
Where’s real world Mari?
Hey why is there not two mari’s?
Mari Real Life: 1 feet
why did i open this expecting to see a version of real world mari :(
I’m as tall as Mari: D. . and I can also play duet on piano…. . and I’m also an older sister…
Open the door to mari first tho
>!Wheres Mari?!<
It’s interesting how OMORI has Violin sprites, yet he’s never seen with it. Same with how RW Mari’s sprite are on HS Mari’s sprite sheet
Yeah, we would never really know the intentions of these scraped ideas
Weren't the rw mari sprites used for the memory flashbacks near the end of the game?
Yeah, but it seems each RW character has their own sprite sheet. I guess it makes sense, considering the small amount of RW / Spirit Mari sprites that they’d be packed together with her HS sprites to limit the game size
This is really nice, but please mark it as a spoiler lol it talks about >!Mari's grave!<
I marked it as a spoiler when I made the post, but it must not have worked. Is it marked properly now?
Its marked now :)
: Excuse me, he asked for no pickles. . : it's pickles or nothing. . : Mari!
read some happy fanfics. . ‘It Really Works!’ and ‘Do You Want to Have a Picnic with Mari?’ are good ones
Omw
Hi there! To make a save file, simply start up the game and play, then save by using Mari’s picnic basket. You then pick one empty slot to save in. This generates one save file, which automatically appears in app.nw. The base game provides you six slots—allowing you to have six save files at the same time. . . In my case, I only had one save file before installing Gomori. At first, Gomori didn’t work for me at all even after following the OP’s instructions. So I moved that file from app.nw to Resources, then started up the game again. Since my lone save was no longer in app.nw, the game behaved as if I’ve never played before and played the intro cutscene again. After that, I just played until Mari’s basket could be accessed and saved again. Then Gomori was functional (if a still bit buggy bc Macs are allergic to games.) :). . (just in case you’re unaware, most people use OneLoader as their Omori mod engine nowadays. You can find that on mods.one! The instructions to install that are the same as Gomori. On a Mac, OP’s instructions here + Resources save file will work as well. Kinda. You’re gonna have to power through some intro crashes.)
I’m back! So, I did everything you said but still nothing’s working. I moved my save file into resources (so there’s no save file in app.nw) and it reset my save file, and  started the game from the beginning. I feel like the problem is that when I originally copy pasted my www folder into app.nw it never asked me to ‘replace files’ like in OP’s instructions. I already deleted the www folder and pasted it there again but it fixed nothing. Should I just copy the save file into app.nw as well?? Here’s a photo of what it (the files) looks like btw:. . 
I think I see the problem! You’ve put the modding files within another “www” folder in app.nw instead of app.nw itself. They should all be hanging out there with the base files. [Here’s]() a pic of my Omori files for comparison.
!!Update!!. . I couldn't work gomori out so i decided to switch to oneloader and this one actually worked! thank you for the advice! :)
That’s great to hear! Glad it works for you, and that I could help! :D
I feel like this is becoming a pattern lol but this time for some reason I have a problem with installing the mod.. . I managed to put in the autumnbreak mod and it was working until it opened to the 'home screen' and it showed me that i had a 'loading error'. So far every time i've opened the game it just keeps saying the same thing. Is there anything i can do to fix it or is it just omori being glitchy cause i'm on mac? I've also attached a photo of what my files look like below in case that helps :'). . 
Hey there! I THINK I remember that the mods themselves actually have to be kept in the ZIP file format. I’ll have to check later when I get home from work. Since it looks like autumnbreak is the only mod you’ve installed for now, it can’t hurt to try and replace the autumnbreak folder with the ZIP file and see what happens. . .  (BTW, if it the game crashes on intro later down the line, when you install more mods, don’t worry too much. In my experience, I just had to keep relaunching Omori until it didn’t. Sometimes it only takes once, other times several. Also, some mods just straight-up won’t work, like UI Fixes. It’s the price we pay for gaming on a Mac, lol.)
 Hey! So, i put it into ZIP file format, but it didn't fix the problem when I enter the game :( it’s still saying ‘loading error’ so I’m wondering if my Omori files are just messed up from all my meddling lol. . . This is what the screen looks like when I open the game btw:. . 
**[MAJOR EDIT ADDED]**. . Sorry it didn’t work out.  :( BUT I can confirm that mods do indeed need to be kept ZIPped. It should look like [so]().. . My game has crashed on startup many times, but I’ve never seen this “loading error” from a mod before. So I downloaded and installed Autumn Break myself and, wouldn’t you know it, I’ve gotten the same result! The only other times Omori players have received this message (that I could find by googling) have been while they were playing the base game. The solution there was to verify the integrity of the files… that would wipe out all necessary files for any modding to work. So. Yeah… we’re just gonna have to admit defeat on this one. It seems like Omori on Macs just can’t handle drastically content-heavy mods like Autumn Break. Curse you, Apple!. . Don’t let this discourage you from trying out the more minor mods, though. If you don’t mind playing through the main story again, a lot of them enhance the game in very nice ways.
hey there, can I ask u to help me too? I've installed mode to play omori with my language (russian), but the game doesn't see russian font (yep, the mode has omori style font in russian). It looks like [that](), maybe you have some ideas what should I do to fix it? tysm
It’s almost fixed! (I think). My files look the same as yours, except that I’m missing the latest.log. Any idea what I can do about that? It also hasn’t asked to replace any files yet like OP was talking about-is that normal?? Thank you for all of your help with this!!. . (I also realized that the 'mod loader' I have is from when I was trying to figure out oneloader, so it's not gomori's and I deleted it. is that going to be a problem, and if so where do I get one for Gomori??). . this is what it looks like btw, minus the mod loader:. . 
Yep, there’s an achievement and a quest here. Be sure to save before messing with stuff!
Me, my first time through: "Oh, what's this weird valve doing sticking out the ground? Hmm, let's turn it left...". . *'You have now wiped out an entire village'*
if u do the quest correctly, u get a free child.
Same here I immediately reloaded when everyone died
You forgot about Mario
0/10 no Rainy Mari. . 
10/10 rain bait
That's some serious dedication, great job! 
thank you, hope you found this helpful!!!
Does most of Sad's survivability even come from the increase defence or the damage conversion?
the conversion… when depressed, half of damage you take is converted to juice!
Happy is really useful for those increased damage by speed but angry is just simply a better way personally
sorry… more elaboration? Why was it better for you personally?
The breaven one is So mean and bull crap cause there is no reason to heal at that point
Do not break your violin, apparitions of your sibling appear in the mirror
Don't play violin
I swear in Rain Mari we are gonna have a line like "You did something bad. But that doesn't make you bad.". .  Like my heart can't handle another game like Omori
TEAR YOUR HEART TO PIECES. . AS FOR THY WOES SHALL COME TRUE. . RAINY MARI TOMORROW
My emotional stability is but a small price for Rainy Mari to come out tomorrow


Its not bad if no one said it was bad in the first place 😄
What do you mean? Like sorry if this comes across rude and this maybe sm I don’t understand because it’s 1am. but I genuinely don’t understand what you are trying to say.. . I just want some clarification.. . Edit: Nvm my brain just woke up lmao.
He means it can't be bad if there are no witnesses who say so lol
This is a certified Japan moment lul
Perhaps something more mature with the same message? This statement has solid logic, no doubt, but Mari is like 20 in the mod.
Even at that age, I still think that statement is so good in filling someone back up with vitality again.
Yes, I agree. I'm the same age and I think this is fairly good, yet it still cuts my ears a little. It sounds a bit like 'people die when they are killed', if you know what I mean. Besides, this was already in the main game, so this exact phrasing probably won't appear.
The Mainy Rari
Mari got the Mainy on her Rari
The Rari Nite.
I know Hero enjoys the manic Mari.
Furious as well
Miserable is Mari after she gave Hero fun times
Sir, this is Gino's but I get your vision lol
She can't stop smiling at the fact that those clowns really think they'll be getting something tomorrow, lol.. . By the way, I can see those scary pupils that u/SuperMTitan puts on Hikiko's default expression now. Can't unsee them!
DOUBTING SPOTTED‼️ OPINION INVALID‼️. . 
I'd be a doubter, if I weren't already a clown. It can't be helped, lol.
All doubter must be deleted from existence via Hikiko's wand. /s
In the RM sub, there is a Doubter flair, and some people already have it. So, there is some work to be done.
We definitely do, my fellow believer
Can you believe it guys? Rainy Mari! Just a week away!
Lmao but for realsies, someone has gotta redraw this pic as HIKIKO.. . 
Furious mari is the reason why sunny scared so much that he pushed her
An angry person is already scary enough, but an angry person that smiles increases their fear factor by tenfold
The little smiley face does not express how far away you'd want to run from her.
The blank eyes do, however. You just have to look at them by themselves, not letting other elements of Hikiko's expression distort its inherent lack of vitality.
Despite everything, It's still yo- wait, wrong game
Belowstory momento
Thank you for using and crediting my comment from the trailer!
Oh my god, I can't believe you of all people would see this!
. . my honest reaction
Real
Screw Rainy Mari tomorrow or whatever, Rainy Mari TODAY!
For some reason i tough It said NEFARIUS instead of furius
Lol, that's funny
I love how even in the miserable sprite, she still looks like she’s trying to hold herself together. Fits her personality perfectly :(
She can't falter, she doesn't have the right to, or so she thinks
Idk why, but I really like the look of Miserable Mari.
It's because she smiles
Tired girls are just peak
For real!
She's still smiling 😊
Menacingly
Real 
Normal: hehe :). . . Manic: HAHAHAHAHAHA. . . Miserable: ha..ha... . . Furious: MWAHAHAHAHAHA
Furious is more Mwahehehehehehe
Rainy Mari is what Omori modding is all about /s
based based based
Of course its off topic, but I have a question - where did you get this picture? Is this from some game or just a art from the players?
fangame autumn break. . its really good
It’s technically a mod over base game but yeah, it’s about few days before leading up to the recital
Thanks!
Should've been FALL break


Awh hell naw Man went to war
He’s seen some things
Mari went on vacation, never came back
I love how you became so disconnected from reality that you're talking about emotion advantages in this scenario

Nah, she'd win even without the emotion advantage

I love Omori—Autumn Break. It’s such a good mod
It was me. 
She has the wrong outfit, literally 1984
Noooo I'm start crying when I start playing this mod...
It’s da Mari
That is Rainy
The Rainy Mar

im pretty sure this is essentially OMORI except on Mari's side?
Yup!
A true omorer doesn’t need to see Rainpost- wait what the fuck??
You should have used this. . 
Don’t have it saved lol
Let's gooooo 
Never have I doubted the Rainy Mari team
LFGOOOOOOO
Rainy Mari is not dead, I knew it!
Click the link to their application forum (it's in their tumblr and I think Youtube). Do note you do need to show a portfolio and be 18+
Times like these, I wish I was decent at more than just writing.
You can do pixel art I remember
Not well T-T
Believers ✅ vs doubters ❌ all over again. . ABSOLUTE DENIAL. . 
peak
Fire
It's time to bite the bullet, they can start hiring for art, programming, or learn as much as you can to start on the simplest of assets needed.
You are right on with that
wow, I would loove, I mean, looooove to be involved, but I doubt I have nearly enough ability to be of any use. . does anyone here know of any way to maybe, watch the process of the game being made, anything publicly available? like maybe a discord server or smth?
From what I read of their form, either you are part of the team and thus know everything, or you don't and thus you know nothing.
aww, I see. . thanks tho :)
Finally omnicat is making another game. Ive been waiting for this for so longgg😭😭😭😭😭
I absolutely loved the rainy Mari trailer! Excited for the demo to release!!
I absolutely loved this trailer, unfortunately I do NOT have the PC version of OMORI (I had it on Xbox back when it was on Gamepass, and I have it on Nintendo Switch), so I will sadly not be able to play it.. . I really am looking forward to this though !!
what is it going to be about :0
I think it gonna be reversed roles as that is predictable
Well yes but unlike other Omari stuff this focuses way more on how Mari would actually act rather then,hey Maris alter ego is a knock off of Omori, Hikiko here feels like how Mari would actually act as Omori only is a silent person that doesn’t speak and often doesn’t have any facial expressions usually which is meant to be an exaggeration of SUNNY’s shyness and more reserved personality at times.
That's what pulled me into the premise of Rainy Mari compared to a lot of other AU Omari out there. I like the concept, but some of the ideas I saw out there always try to assume Mari would be just like Sunny, and that shouldn't be the case. . . To me, Mari, or in this case, "Hikiko" should be a different kind of person from Sunny/Omori. She's wouldn't be shy or quiet. In headspace, she would be overtly a compassionate and upbeat personality who treats everything in headspace with sincerity. I like in the trailer you see she does talk. She's usually always smiling even when she's depressed because it totally lines up with how Mari was perceived. Her persona would be trying to occupy her mind and say "everything's fine" and smother her friends and brother constantly with love than think of any bad "thoughts" in the real world. . . Hope that wasn't a bit much. 😅. . I'm really excited about an Omari project and can't wait to see when it comes out.
I just watched the trailer. Had no idea it existed before seeing this post. Time to join another waiting game.
This mod was in development for almost 5 years I’ve been waiting a lot more I just hope they don’t cancel it after a demo
YouTube kept shoving it down my throat and I finaly said “Fine YouTube I’ll watch it!” And by the end I was going:
Thanks for sharing- this looks really cool
Oh My GOD! Rainy Mari mod is finally back.
Second comment cause I just got a notification back to this post but: I think Rainy Mari is going to be Omori’s Undertale Yellow
Cant wait for its release really want to try it out
It’s a mod just like the flair says
mb I didn't see that
Don’t worry
I saw it yesterday it was fantastic!
I guess Mari came up with different concepts to sunny which, I mean, makes sense
And since the name of the area is Everbloom Woods, I guess Mari views the plantations around Faraway as a wood that is ever blooming with flowers, as oppose to Sunny who thinks of it as a forest that is vastly stretched to the horizon.
I got this reply to 67 upvotes
I thank thee for thy generosity
I think it's because Mari's version of headspace is more mature than Sunny's. I mean like, Vast Forest sounds like a name a kid would come up with, while Everblooming Forest is more poetic but that's just my opinion
So she just wanna sound tuff
How does Everbloom Woods sound tough? It sounds more romantic than Vast Forest though, I'd give you that.
She just strikes me as the kinda gal who would try to decorate every notebook portrait with an overelaborate drawing just for the aesthetic, if you get what I mean. Hermione type shi but way less obnoxious
Honestly, I get your vision, and Mari was said to be quite good in arts also. But flower based decoration seems to be more up in Basil's alley.
the rock?
No not Dwayne Johnson 
Boiiii this is so tuff
I agree Mari's Headspace is more mature since it is much less outlandish than Sunny's Headspace, but the fact that said maturity can affect how people name places is fascinating. And yes, Everbloom Woods is indeed more poetic than just Vast Forest, which just sound like a title drop meme lol.
It's even more plausible if Mari's Headspace is based on Sunny's sketches of his Headspace. So what we are seeing is Mari's **imperfect** interpretation of them.
Hero's cafe is probably part of a bigger location called Mariland, at least from what I have read of that Twitter post. So the place for Basil is probably a part of Everbloom Woods. It is interesting for her to set up locations based on each member of the Faraway gang. So then Kel's place has something to do with Orange Joe or basketball, maybe akin to Orange Oasis, and Aubrey has something to do with Plantegg or baseball.. . But then again, Sunny's sketchbook probably covered those plausible locations too, and Mari's Heasspace just based the location off of that with minor to fit with Mari's more limited imaginative power.
I’m sorry guys, I only played the canonic game. What the heck is this thing?
its a mod where mari is in sunny's position
Thank you also sounds interesting
Why not?
Lol
Can anyone tell me the best omori mods? The only ones i know are reverie and i guess rainy marie, not sure which ones i should play but i want a reason to play omori again after finishing the game a while ago.
Mari was a girl so she would think like a girl maybe
Well, not to be rude, but that is a factor influencing her Headspace.
Like instead of simple white space with just mewo a computer and a notebook she designed it as lots of books a chesboard like yer hoobys are in there more style more fun its not simple like sunnys thats actualy good referance on sunny and maris diffirent personality based on genders and influence she even designed a chair to sit on W mari and called the room bright room instaed of only white space
Oh god...
Could you let me know what this involves?
Sunny thinking as vast forest like things more basic but she thinks as flower blossom like more focused on flowers probably thats why I call it mari being just a girl simple fact shr loves flowers
It's Mari's Headspace, simple, same reason with White Space becoming the Bright Room, she just names things differently even if-conceptually, they are the same
True, and I did further elaborate about the naming scheme and what it could entail in my comments above lol
These Woods sure are Blooming Forever...
What's next? The state of Mariland?
is this available to play?
Not yet, gotta wait until the heat death of the universe
Don't you mean the full game?
That's when it'll come out
Demo should be released in 2025
Why mari looked like an e-girl or lesbian bro😭. (No hate just asking)
Another version of her who knows about the Original one, so much so that in the end Sunny calls her "Marianne" to differentiate from Mari.

I have always been fascinated by the focus on Mari in any Omori premise. I believe she is one of the most interesting characters in the story because her underlying development is revealed to us subtly. For us, Mari appears to be the perfect daughter, sister, and friend. However, we know enough in the real world that leading up to the recital, Mari put a lot of focus and intense pressure on herself and Sunny to achieve the goal of perfection, and it was overwhelming her. I thought it was an interesting characterization, and I assume at the time, it was hinting at the idea that Mari had taken her life because of it. I thought it was so fascinating that because of the incident on the stairs, she essentially dies as a martyr, where that idealized version of her portrayed by Sunny and the rest of the group outshine her actual character and circumstances of her death are likely to be overlooked. Any AU that emphasizes those flaws and explores a scenario where Mari is in Sunny's position as a character interests me.   .   . While we don't know many details, Rainy Mari stands out from some of the other AUs I've seen so far. I could go on about the aesthetics or the simple idea of having Hikki talk and smile, but what strikes me about the artwork and trailers is that it feels like a genuine Mari story. Elements here feel more unique to what is catered to Mari than Sunny had. AU's that just reverse their roles and depict Mari like Sunny is only doing half the work, where it should explore more of the emotional complexity of an older protagonist like Mari, or how her relationships with the rest of the group will be different without Sunny.. . Since it's an Omori game, we should expect some tragedy. I am particularly interested in exploring Mari's perceived inadequacies leading to the incident and how the story will unfold, like whether she finds the courage to confront the truth or suppress her guilt to maintain her idealized image of perfection.
I WISH I had PC OMORI just so I could play this mod (completed the game on Xbox ((before it was removed from Gamepass)) and Switch)
I'm legit considering getting a steam deck, buying Omori on Steam and Installing mods for Omori there. Just so I can have my depression on the go. Lol
oh! Good luck with thatt5\31hpy:28765
This looks awesome and is a pretty neat concept! Will definitely try it out once the demo comes out, thank you for sharing it  
It looks amazing

Is this out yet
No
fuck
I'm dying to play this mod
Me too.
This mod has secrets in the trailer that actually have to do with the real world if you pause at the correct times. . I made a post on the mod a while ago when the trailer came out about it ([) Unlike the main game it seems the family hasn’t split and nor is the protagonist moving away unlike og OMORI. . . . Also sort the comments by new on the trailer and take a shot everytime someone confuses it for being official
Really looking forward to this mod. Wishing the dev team good luck. If anything, I’m more excited to hear what other OST comes out bc the one for the trailer was peak.
Somehow I get the feeling he saw Mari do this at least once to get away with doing something
"You take the blue pill – the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill – you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes." -Morpheus. . 
Or to sum it up. . "Red pill - Sunny/Mari route. Blue pill - Omori/Hikiko route. Make your choice."
>Make your choice.". . . . I'm sorry, no more Matrix references after this. Lol
Ahahahaha
Wouldn't it be the other way around? Cuz like sunny/mari route leads to a good ending, does it not?
Oh shit, you're right! Gotta correct that!
References from the Matrix are just so cool. 😎
Maybe to match Sunny's pinwheel color? Then again, why didn't Hikiko paint the basket blue? Maybe it's some sort of allusion to the sun sitting in the blue sky. Another valid possibility is that Mari subconsciously hates seeing her brother on red things because it could remind her of the incident (the red mat as a big puddle of blood).
Ah thank you for the correction! I haven't been keeping up with anything about Rainy Mari that goes more into detail so I just missed that. I should look into it more lol.
No worries, glad to see people talking about Rainy Mari in general really
Rainy Mari tomorrow 
Real
Good day. I apologize for my poor English, it’s not my main language. Here’s my theory:. . In the original OMORI, if we go to the secret location — the friends’ spot by the lake — we’ll see the same kind of blue picnic blanket, and Sunny will say that it’s nothing like Mari’s. What if this detail in the game is actually a reference…?  . That is, Mari gave Sunny a completely different blanket and left him with Basil, as if distancing herself from interfering with him and creating his own personal safe space, where the difference in color symbolizes separation from the threat represented by Mari, and Basil as a sort of protector and savior.
Thanks for the compliment :D. . . As strange as it may sound, I actually want it to be that way in the story (that Mari pushed Sunny toward suicide).  . First, because it really brings a kind of tragedy that’s both interesting and different from the original — possibly even deeper than in the original — since she was supposed to protect him, yet she became the cause of his death.  . And second, because it would give Mari the motivation to tell everyone the truth, which would also be an interesting twist. Unlike Sunny, everyone already knows her, so it would work like an inversion…  . In the original, no one knew the truth except Sunny (and his companion, if you know what I mean :D), but here it would be the opposite — everyone would know the truth "except Mari herself (?)", and it would be fascinating to see such a concept…. . I really hope to play Rainy Mari in 2025. I’m also looking forward to more of your overanalyses. They’re simply amazing, man... Though I understand that the further you go, the harder it gets to find new details.
For how Mari will tell the truth, I think at first out of great guilt, Mari would be inclined to come clean about it, knowing she would be hated by everyone. It does not matter for her though, she already cannot look at the mirror herself without being condescending towards her reflection anyway. So she gathers all her friends in a meetup some time after Sunny's funeral to tell them about it. Unforunately, she was hesistant and unable to speak up about it herself. But, thankfully or not, Basil is a sensitive boy, and knows it is time to break the news to everyone. So, Basil tells everyone about Mari's horrid treatment of Sunny during practices leading up to the recital, with photographic evidence . Everyone is in disbelief about the truth, as their image of Mari is broken in pieces. They all give Mari a look to see and ask her if what Basil said is true, and to that, she smiles, a smile that somehow exudes warmth and depravity simultaneously. She nods and says that Basil is right, she is responsible for it. Chaos then ensues, and all that occurs after becomes history 3 to 4 years later, which is roughly when Rainy Mari takes place. That's how I think it would go, at least.. . As for the inversion, yeah, it is a good way to go about it, but I do not think it is a full inversion. It just switches from everyone except the perpetrators does not know to everyone knows, including the perpetrator herself. Thus, the focus will shift from telling the truth to accepting and utilising the perceived positive and negative traits within oneself, I think.. . And I'm glad to see another one enjoying my overanalyses of Rainy Mari too! Yeah, it is getting harder and harder to find new details to overanalyse over time, which is why I cannot wait for the demo to come out, so that I can overanalyse it to Headspace and back! Though I may not be able to Rainy Mari, I am looking forward to seeing more details in said mod. They will become important narrative materials for me to make use of in my posts.
There's another picnic mat in Faraway with a blue tone. Could have something to do with that.
Wait it's out?
No
>!Endless Staircase is gonna be rough on Mari!<
>!But, if it’s endless she’ll never finish falling, so she’ll never die… right? Please say yes I don’t want her to die!<
>!It means eternally being in a superposition of alive and dead. Schroedinger’s Staircase. So technically not dead!!<
I’ll halfway take that!
You’re halfway welcome! Or, “welc”, to be precise!
Don't worry guys I taught her how to blj
Wahoo~!
Alright bro,you need to install the app sm64excoop(version 36.1 you can found it on YouTube)then you download the mod Mario skin pack V2 (I think you can use the first version but I use this one because that's the one I downloaded) then you install zarchiver,open sm64excoop give the permission,open zarchiver give permission,after downloading the Mario pack you click on the archiver then extract go to the main one (android/0 where the files like android and download is) there will be a fille with the name:com.owokitty.sm64excoop enter it then click on mods put the extracted Mario mod, after that,you download the omori mod (it's on gamebanana) enter on the file then actors and take all the archives with the name geo.bin then(wait a bit I'm thinking in how to proceed)
Mari being a gremlin = Mari's autism is not a bad way to go from here. 🤝😅. . One thing I really like about Mari is the idea of her being mischievous at one point because it's something of her past that rarely gets brought up. It's intriguing and might be fun to dive into that in either Hikki of the Valley or Rainy Mari.
MARIjuana
Omari mods in a nutshell tbh
Omari who? Wolves legend Omari Spellman?
 Nah, it's not SOMETHING. Mari looks better tho
Yes, I think Mari decides what Sunny will do each day by reading the corresponding books. Even though "Playground in the Woods" seems like the pinnacle of fiction, it's not Crime and Punishment — an age-appropriate book for hers (around 18-19 in the mod's narrative). Basically, Mari logs in every day to babysit her Tamagotchi and to decide its daily routine. Obviously, she can't break her four-year strike of logging in.
Mari also reads book in order to sleep better at night, and I do not think Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment would help you sleep better after reading. It would probably give you and her a moral crisis dead in the night lol. This effect of moral insomniac would be exacerbated much more if she read the book after the incident, since it was Mari who pushed him to >!suicide!< via >!emotional damage!< in my opinion. Also lol, love the comparison between Mari visiting her Headspace to take care of Headspace Sunny as Hikiko and her logging into Tamagotchi to check on her digital pet. I guess the difference is that Headspace is much more complex and in turn Headspace Sunny's behaviour is more varied.. . Also, imagine Playground in the Woods is literally Craig of the Creek as a book lul.
Is this image kinda the rainy mari version of deeper well?
Wait, what do you mean Deeper Well? Is that a location in Omori?
You haven't!? How would you play Rainy Mari then?. . Playing OMORI is still a fun experience though, even if one were to already know the story!
I will, but I haven't gotten around to buying Omori because I have never spent money on games before, and I fear I may not have the time commitment necessary to play Omori. Still, I hope to get around to playing it one day.
Well, I was super into Omori before, so it's not like I didn't know much before jumping back onto it. It's just this time I get to use those knowledge to craft theories and overanalyses for Rainy Mari.
Rainy Mari and now this??? We’re eating good!
I dont think mari used her jump rope right
Image 7 is literally the Rainy Mari/Omari AU
Mari au be like
Rainy Mari moment
*waits patiently for mod*
I cannot be patient anymore, I am already overananalysing it lol
Hmmm, what genre is this? I can hear both synth and bass though, so it reminds me of your post about jazz fusion and the drawing of Mars and Aubs together. Mari has a baseball bat here, so perhaps she's still playing softball with Aubrey — hence why the track leans towards her side.   .   . Neat track. Btw. the composer also did some tracks for reverie.
I feel like this need to be said, but Hikki of the Valley has narrative differences to Rainy Mari. One of those being the events leading to Sunny's death. In Rainy Mari, it was the recital's practice deteriorating Sunny and Mari's relationship until it hit a critical low. In Hikki of the Valley however, it was the lake and how Sunny actually drowned in it this time around, as Mari wasn't able to save him in time. Due to how Sunny's death in Hikki of the Valley being more of an unfortunate event that isn't very subtly forewarned for at least days on end like the recital's practices, I'm guessing Hikki of the Valley will have a more standard story of Mari's grievances and how she cope with Sunny's death. The mistakes Mari made thus had more to do with inaction instead of action (she could have done it sooner - Hikki of the Valley vs she could have stopped - Rainy Mari plausibly).. . I can totally see that after Sunny's death in Hikki of the Valley, Mari may go a bit punk like Aubrey did in main canon and listen to some of that rock music. But given that Mari in Hikki of the Valley has a narrative direction similar to Omari than Rainy Mari, she may actually locked herself in the house much more. At most, she probably got pulled out of it by Hero or Aubrey.. . Not a lot is shown for Hikki of the Valley now though, so nothing I said here is conclusive. And if you are still reading this, thanks for heeding to my yapping.
That's interesting — thanks for telling me; I didn't know anything about this mod. Regardless of how standard of a story this will be, still exciting to see.
This at least will quell my Rainy Mari withdrawal for the time being lol
>I can totally see that after Sunny's death in Hikki of the Valley, Mari may go a bit punk like Aubrey did in main canon and listen to some of that rock music.. .  So, are we saying Mari's kind of gone punk rocker? 😅. . . . Ngl, while Rainy Mari is still my niche, Hikki of the Valley does sound plenty intriguing as well.
Where did you get that information from?
Analysing [the teaser trailer for Hikki of the Valley]().
Nice!
The more Omari mods that get released, the better
They do look alike, but tbh she can be really anything
Yeah, I was thinking she can be HS Cute Girl too. Miss Candice's assistant Curtsey I mean.
My best guess would be at a chessboard
Do you think it's the chessboard in the Bright Room?
Not necessarily. It might be, but having an entity from Bright Room in Mari's Headspace doesn't seem very plausible. Maybe it's a Sprout Mole counter part with the queen being Sweetheart
Wait, could the Black Pawn be a metaphor for "Rainy Mari Tomorrow"???
Imagine :(
I don't think it matters where; the point is that *it isn't supposed to be here*. So Hikiko will take the pawn where it belongs — to the pawn shop. She doesn't need things in her life that she can't control.
Oh well, I guess that pawn is going to the shadow realm
Yeah, I wonder if there will be a dark room as an analogy to the blackspace. Most likely, yes, I think. Maybe Hikiko will send the pawn to the chessboard in the dark room.. . In the original game, I like how Sunny's subconscious effort translates into Omori's conscious effort. When Basil was about to spill the beans, Omori quickly sent him to the gulag (blackspace) and saved the day, lol. I can see Hikiko doing similar things, even though they are more separate with Mari from each other. Perhaps when she wills things out of existence, she sends them to the dark room? Don't know how this idea plays, just an interesting thought, have to think about it.. . 
Hikiko whenever something doesn't work exactly as how she wanted: Looks like you're going to the Dark Room, Jimbo!
First of all sorry for my punctitions sunny created white space FOR SURVIVING that in the it clearly say white soace is a place ti survive not for live but mari created the same white soace called it brightroom added stuff such as her hobbies now my theory comes at this place. . Even after 4 years mari didn t overcome to lose her brother that he needed a place TO LIVE not surviving but sunny only needed a place to live so he jusr added a pc mevo a book and done now lets go to the pawn section. . Chess is a 2 player game right then why is it there in maris bright room simple actually mari misses her brother that he filled the entire room hobis that she did with her brother he filled it with books that he once readed to sunny make him fall asleep and now in this photo it says chess pawn is not the place it suppose to be what does this mean well first lets head to my theory. . Mari actually created a bright room that is so succesfull that she never needed to go headspace at some point so sunnys spirit had no chance of see her and make her to go to black room or black space he needed to contact to her so he when mari as awake had actually managed to stole pawns and filled it across the headspace so mari can go to headspace and sunny can contact her and eventually she realized headspace is like real paradise of her her brother her friends was here she can be an sister again and protect sunny also we can see in bee siege video sunny acts worried mari asks whats wrong sunny you can tell me anything and stuff then he asks for honey he wants for his toast then out of nowgere bee attack comes coincidence no sunny maked bees come so maru can go ti adventure eventually leading her to some truth such as going to other biomes so mari can face the events that can trigger mari perdonslity grow stronger to overcome hikiko and so he uses pawns bees and other stuff even in that video sunny asks for hey mari can I come with yall but mari ofcourse denies and make him wait on picnic sunny wants to gi becayse if he does he can directly link mari to black space truth and kind stuff. . Well the other my theory amplies that pawn is racist and mari putted him on there for making it stop. . . Remember mari uses headspace and bright room for living in her older life kind of paradise but sunny used it fot surviving he could enjoy and make aubrey his girlfriend but no he just used it for surviving
Bruh...

i warned you
DUDE That's so COOL!   . I never thought anyone would actually go back to the legacy PC/AT era and still develop software.
so i got a tile editor to use from the 8-Bit-Guy, but since the code was written for the PET I'm going to have to rewrite it to work on DOS.
lol that wasn’t suppose to link to the Tandy subreddit.
I ACTUALLY WANNA PLAY THIS
IKR! It looks so good
Is it a real game?
OMARI done right.
Aww. While I didn’t play it personally, I did see a playthrough of the mod. And I did love his previous works with the You’re Back Mari/Pursuit AU. Just by these, I can tell they’re really skilled.. . I wish Oto the absolute best with their condition. And I hope they can come up with a satisfying conclusion to the mod.
MARI NOOOOOO 
. . Oh, what a yummy milkshak-. . >![👁️ *corpse*]()!<
>!the eye doesn't censor for me on mobile!<
>! 👁. . . . !<
Omg is that ferb 😨😨😨😨
It’s a meme of the Grimace Milkshake, being released on Grimace’s birthday this year. In the meme, a person drinks the Grimace Milkshake for a review, he says it tastes pretty good, but then is shown dying after. The “NOOOOOO” text is because Mari Cat is drinking it, and could possibly die too.

Looooore

😨 MARI NOOOOOO
>!not possibly. she already did lol!<
The more we care about lol also I couldn’t tell it was the grimace milkshake I didn’t connect the dots either lol 
Who is grimace
Grimace is one of the mascot characters from “McDonalds”. He is part of the original, older mascot lineup along with Ronald McDonald, Birdie The Early Bird, Hamburglar, who as the name suggests, steals burgers, and Officer Big Mac, who is literally a cop whose head is a Big-Mac with eyes, basically, as the name suggests, stops the wrongdoers, criminals, villains, and stuff, including Hamburglar and Grimace.. . Fun Fact: Grimace used to have 4 arms, and was named “Evil Grimace” back then. But due to copyright reasons it was changed to 2 arms, and the word “Evil” was scrapped off his name. Now he is just “Grimace”.. . I will now explain the rest of his character.. . He is like a purple blob, 2 arms, 2 eyes, 2 legs, no nose, and in terms of morality and stuff, he is like the Hamburglar but he steals milkshakes and soda instead of burgers. He loves those. (That’s why they chose a milkshake for his birthday.)
Oh interesting. I don't know why the UK only adopted Ronald McDonald as the only mascot but yeah I had no idea about half of these
Oh. I thought it was lean.
Aw thanks Peter
No Mari! Don't Drink The Lean Shake!
ohhh, isnt the girl named like mari or something
Yeah Mari
she looks nice
She really does 
Youll see her a lot when playing the game 
awh, i wanna be friends with her now
NOOOOO. . WHY MARI
MARI NOOOOOOOOO
MARI NOOOOOOOOO
MARI NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. . 
MARI STOP- 
Mari had a canon event
MARI WHY, DON’T DRINK THIS
Mari on the lean 
I love how it's only revealed at the end that this interaction DOESN'T take place in a "Mari survives" AU, adds a lot of comedic value

I mean, I don't think having an obsession for Mari is unhealthy :^
>!Omg the Mari description. "For some hang time". The devs i stg!<
spoilers pls
Oh god, that’s terrible
>!Guess it explains how he got over Mari's death so quick. He's just not thinking too hard about his bad memories most of the time. Shoved them in some corner of his mind and left it there to be ignored forever.!<
spoiler would be appreciated
Huh, honestly, I didn't even think about it. Sorry about that, I'll go fix it now.
How about you go spoil some bitches
Mari’s page… >!“For some HANG TIME with your friends-…”!< Hello? 911? I’d like to report a FUCKINF CRIME?!? 
>!"It's ridiculous- couldn't possibly be true. Mari died of that damn rope 3 years ago..."!<
I wonder if they will do Mari.
They already have! You can view it [here](). They've also done the rest of the main cast, but only the headspace versions
It’s “Ayo, the pizza’s here” time!
XD
And [that]() is MARIO for you . . .
We already have rw mari plush, it's a keychain though
I'm, not talking about that cursed shit, but actual rw Mari plushies
Oh god what are they gonna do for >!MARI!<. . real 50/50 here
Omg that's a good question I'm scared now
>!a grave!<
sad:(. . also sorta wonder how y'all got those.little titles of the characters
>!Nahhh that's so dead!< 😒 (pun unintended)
first Aubrey steals Mari's hair ribbon now Mari steals Henry's jacket 
Then >!Sunny steals Mari’s life!<
Well >!he stole his own life after so it cancels out!<
Respect redeemed
W-well, umm actually, his full name is Henrybrine Sandwich.
mari is sans???????

Exactly, mari has him
Mari kinda lookin' like sans
The saddest part is that Mari is dead now so now this will never happen again
Woah well done. . . Now for extra spooks it should flash hellmari whenever you click.
now get a mari one and throw her down some stairs   💥💥💥💥💥
mari has the handwriting of those girls that would bring like 7 different pencil cases to school and make the most aesthetic titles and outlines and stuff
Unrealistic, Mari’s would actually be like
I don't think Mari can write.
Mari's one is so cute 
Mari would write very fancy calligraphy probably
The Mari one's [canon]()
I'm 25 and I'm literally shorter than all of those real world version. Even shorter than DREAMWORLD Mari.
Same
yo tengo 19 y soy mas bajo que omori chiquito
can't believe mari went from being 5'5 to being -6'0
take my upvote and leave tnx
Take my upvote. I hope you both sides of your pillow are warm tonight
r/rareinsults
She also became 8 foot tall for a slight moment. Must have been tiring hanging from that height
OH MY GOD
Already read that on a youtube comment . . But take my upvote nonetheless
<3
HOW DARE 
what fucking madlad gave this the heartwarming award
Poor Mari, now I'm scared of stairs
Take my upvote, but I hope you go out the same way Mahito did.
Anyone notice how Mari is in between because she hasn’t grown since childhood?
corpses don't grow my amigo
That’s the joke pal
no you don't get it that was my cumrag typing. . corpse rotting means less body, less body = less height. shorter
Well I mean Mari seems to be growing that neck of hers long after she died
Fun fact: Real World Mari is also six feet!. . &#x200B;. . >!...Six feet under.!<
OK but how tall is real world Mari? 
i was about to ask about real-world mari 💀
>!Real world Mari’s height -182.88cm!<
Hey why isn’t Mari in the second one?
I'm a girl that plays piano, I have a younger brother, and I'm the exact same height as Mari. Wish me luck...
you should’ve gone 6ft deep for Mari
I love how we dont get a before disaster Mari
omg im as tall as mari! !!
Nah, we need to wait until a Mari is made
I agree
And then we should wait for a something plushie to come out.
I'm shocked too, but it's Mari. She has blouse with collar
Yep definitely Mari. You can also see the end of her hair at the bottom of the picture next to Aubrey
So many revelations in just one day
HOLD IT!. . If it was truly Mari then why does this picture wasn't taken by Aubrey? I just checked and it was already there in the album while adding pictures stolen by Aubrey. I remember also that Hero said that ALL Mari photos were taken.. . Is it a mf plothole or does even Omocat forgot that it was Mari? OMG.
It’s Mari’s and Sunny’s secret sibling.
Surri
Manny
NO NOT HIM PLEASE
>!oh my god my mari plush’s neck is broken!<
Ohhh that's what this picture is. I have a malformed mari plush I've gotta try this
>!keep it malformed, it's lore accurate!<

probably marisa (eosd)
I just got my copy today. If you take the sleeve out of the case it's a lot clearer to see that >!Something is covering Mari's blurred out face!< 
 Mari jumpscare
I've hit my sister with a bat before and she's fine >!Mari is just a little bitch !<
didnt drink enough milk

they had VERY long stairs tho
And a broken violin at the bottom right where she landed
And the stairs are made of wood, a very firm material
Good bot
You just reminded me that my great grandfather actually killed my grunkle with a bat while hiding at the top of the stairs for a prank.
Ain't no way 🧢
Well the “stairs” were the stairs leading into the house I think (like two steps) and so he fell when he stumbled backwards.. . Although I don’t really remember the story that well
Yo sis wig kinda looks like mario form sonic legends aint gonna lie 
Hellmari scream me
ayo mari in irl?
Mari's having a panic attack in the changing room
Oh fuck 
At least he'll get to be with Mari again
Too late. >!tell Mari I said hi!<

He's more like Mari honestly.
Mari is the same word, just written in a different font
Oh shit.
Damn man

Get a Hellmari cutout, wait until night and put it up facing out a window.

Snap your fingers and make it all disappear. Make sure you get rid that omori fella. Bring him back his shitty reality and tell him you can fix it all in exchange for a favor

Yes. . 
SOMETHING as a wig really feels that it has been made with >!Mari's hair !< (even more on that last pic)
i thought mari was the one who fell
This is how I felt when I woke up to my dog destroying Headspace Mari right before my eyes. She no longer has an ear. 💀
Mari came back
mari would love this!! :D

Mari's honest reaction players didn't forgive her brother:. . 
I completely accept if it turns me into a mari clone
>!mari out to get her revenge!< 
Shotgun Mari is my spirit animal.
. . You better watch out. Mari's 100m away from your location, and readying a full on assault.
I mean, we know she can't run for very long, what's she gonna do?
Break the laws of physics, and by that I mean safely use the stairs.
I’m adding Mari with a shotgun to my au even if it makes no sense.
I loved the part where Mari got the shotgun out and said: "It's Marin' time" and started Marin' all over the place
Such an emotional scene😔
\+ ARMED  . Mari Suzuki loads her cannon!  . \+ LOADED  . Mari Suzuki is lining up her shot!  . \+ DANGEROUS  . Mari Suzuki will kill.  . Mari Suzuki blasts your body to bits!  . \+ RUPTURE  . Sunny Suzuki has fallen!  . GAME OVER
mari has had enough of everyone's bullshit
mari has fucking had it
By "RW Mari", do you mean the monochrome white spirit version, or the teenager version that appears in the whole memory sequence at the end?
Mari x Doom
IT MAKES SENSE WHA-. . its just like that mario/march 10 thing :0

yeah that one
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARI!!!

How can we be sure that YOU are not Mari?
Well her name is mari and mine is oliver so im pretty sure if i was mari my name wouldnt be oliver. otherwise i dont think theres any way to differentiate between us🥰💙
That's exactly what Mari would say to trick us!
THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY AAAAAAAAA that little warm smug face she has  happy birthday Mari!!!
 ✿She’ll be by your side…in a very fluffy, very cute outfit. ( Good God I’ve never cared about fictional birthdays but OMORI is just such…a good time. And the community is so wholesome too so… HAPPY BIRTHDAY MARI! :] )
The bandana she's wearing reminds me of her picnic blanket in headspace :). . . Regardless Mari is sooooo pretty! 💜
Omg it's Mari's?! Happy bday Mari!! ✨✨✨ . .

They wrote some of the biggest works in the fandom, You're Back Mari and Pursuit AU, developed the The Dreamer mod, and hosted the two biggest MAPs for Omori animating one for the Bad end and Good end under the titles Bad Apple and Echo which are bangers imo.
I already placed the order on my Mari, what the hell just happened?
People went absolutely feral and sold out all of the plushies 
Well, glad I got my  before that happened.
HELLMARI
Add a >!hellMari the one with the big mouth opened!<

Tamari plush
Mari next to stairs
i’m fine with new fans, though Jaden Animations’ primarily makes all-ages content, hence her young audience who should not be exposed to the content in OMORI... maybe if she played it on a different channel or something
I don’t think any FNAF jumpscare can compare the >!hellmari!<
Oh no it's HELLMARI. . Oh wait that's an Enderman
great idea, going to put a hellmari cutout (or something) out of my window. sadly not in the front of the house but the neighbors behind me will get a scare!!
He’s just trying to reach Mari
OH NO YOU DID NOT
I hope they have Mari's cookies. Want to have that permanent boost to my stats
Mari is a furry confimed.
Wow thats amazing, i would go there if i had the chance  (Also why is mari in a cat suit?)
MARIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII AND BASIIIIIIIIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLLLLLL YIPPIEEEEEEEEEEEEE
It just occurred to me that Mari is the only one wearing shoes.
Catgirl mari ?
MARI NOOOOOOOO
and anymari as well
There's a lot to indicate he has no anger. At least not with the intent of violence.. . He's seen as a timid, shy kid, someone who doesn't ever want to hurt. I mean the photos while the main memories still prove his intentions aren't to hurt but to feel love. He didn't want to hurt Mari, the push was to gain space, not to hurt her. It was an accident. . . Whether you see it as a crime or a bad thing is up to you but I see it as something out of his control.
By the way he thinks, I don't believe he was timid and shy, he IS a bit sassy, and doesn't talk most of the game, but he yells to deliever pizza just fine, as well as being able to approach people like any other person.. . I believe he just doesn't want to talk, but neither in headspace or in the real world does he seem to be violent, he stays behind his friends in most boss intros.
Bruv he's literally just violent in HEADSPACE. He carries a knife.. . He's not sassy he's just quiet and shy which adds to his introverted behaviour. Plus the pizza delivery is entirely optional so it's not exactly Canon to me.
We'll tbh his angry sprite in the real world seems just as if not angrier than even enraged Omori, and that's over a fly passing close to his face
"some".. . Yes, a steak and a bit of money will do the trick. Seriously she needs to be held captive for the neglect she gave him. She only now decides to let him move away, WHY NOW? Why not before...?. . I hate this idea that she's morally gifted, she abandoned him, and for what? Because of Mari, she needs to be held accountable for leaving him... ;/
Yeah after playing this game for the 5th time running I've managed to get a lot of the details.. . &#x200B;. . Sunny isn't good or bad, he's a neutral face, and think it kinda intertwines with his actions too, the push wasn't necessary but if you look at it this way he only did it for the space, Mari invaded his privacy, forced him to prematurely prepare for the recital and had blisters, though he didn't tell anyone I mean why would he, he isn't that emotional and is shy, he probably didn't want Mari to be blamed for it. So him going into his bubble makes a ton of sense since he regretted his actions for 4 years straight.. . Aubrey is similar like I said, she's emotionally gifted, and while yes she hurt Basil, on purpose mind she didn't know Sunny scribbled the photos.. . Hero locked himself away for a year due to Mari's suicide and pitted the blame on himself for his failure to protect her. So him doing so really makes a ton of sense and him being sympathetic and caring, even after pushing Kel makes more sense as he's never been one for violence.. . Kel uses a fake smile and positivity to try to cope with Mari's death, he may not be close to her but because they all were hanging out for over 3-4 years. Kel isn't just an idiot, he has moral and faulty values, he stays away from Aubrey for reasons and didn't visit Mari's grave... much due to not wanting it to eat him inside, he wanted to stay true to himself and have a clear path of happiness, even though he ate him up inside. He didn't forget her. It's why he retaliates when Mari gets mentioned by Aubrey.. . &#x200B;. . Basil is different, he's kinda the whole plot device and while he's not shown a lot, his connection to the suicide, causing the nightmares in Sunny, having huge regret, anxiety, and suffering add to his depth and pain. His deep and moral friendship with Sunny adds to the factor that he's clingy, emotional, and thoughtful, the album meant a lot to him and is a big BIG deal to the story.. . &#x200B;. . Honestly, I can't say much about Mari, she's a goddamn perfectionist and I've covered her way too much beforehand. Say what you want about each character, hate them, love them, resent them, enjoy their involvement, who cares? They are all kids and kids do idiotic things, heck I'm 18 and I've made horrible mistakes over the last 2-3 years (for reasons) so it's 100% normal to feel for the characters, they are all different and have different views on each other, both good and bad.. . Thanks for listening.
Any hellmari cosplay I wonder
🦒
Is Mari to blame?
Mari I know you love your husband but please don't eat him during an argument
mari pack it up we know it’s you
Put a picture of Mari beside the staircase and one on a tree in your school backyard
Spoilers ahead!. . Something?. . Sorry MARI, I was doing something . . I'm something. . . MARI N- . . Like I felt this is perfect time for this meme
New >!Mari!< just dropped!
new >!Snnuy!< just dropped >!from the hospital balcony!<!
new mari just dropped
Mario: *Exists as a name for a ship*. . Luigi: "Oh noe! Where is Mario?? Which one is Mario??"
Luigi has to pick which is his actual brother. . . The teenage couple or the guy with a red outfit, overalls and a hat just like his own (hat and overalls) with his initial on it
Yeah that's hard tbh
ok im calling this ship mario
Yea that makes so much sense! Mari and ohio!!! So cutesy🥰🥰🥰
They weren't ever actual couples due to their parents being against that stuff, >!so due to mari's death they never had the chance to be in an actual relationship!< they were lovey dovey with eachother lots which implied a relationship so technicallyy it's a ship that's definitely canon in a sense
We finally got the Mari plush she just cut her hair is all
i was >!also!< mari!
>!hi Mari!<
Nice Mari cosplay 😎👌
🎶so sad that Mari died of ligma🎶
: Who the fuck is Mari?. . :  🎶Ligma balls🎶
The GriMari shake 

Mari got grimace shake on her mind
I mixed vanilla with strawberry milk cus I got grimace shake on my mind
“Got vanilla mixed with strawberry cause everytime I wake up in the morning I got grimace on my mind”
Well there's art of cat mari drinking the grimace shake if that counts. It's also on twitter btw
I SAW THAT OMFG ✌️👹 AND IT WAS ACTUALLY CUTE
Well yeah, >!until the effects of the grimace kick in...!<
because the sequel (Mari2 (Me)) is better 
Holy crap >!mari is gonna die again???!<
Hasn't Mari been through enough?!?
Mari figurine is the ugliest one i believe
You're the ugliest one out of your family.. . . . I'm sorry I have no idea what made me say that.
Get le trolled xD >!Mari got pwned xDDD!<
I sure do love playing this on my 3ds, anyways I'm gonna watch evrey ytpmv that there is in this game and grind 1 ups on mario world so I can try to beat bowser for the 189th time, and not take around 10 years to finish the game.
>!i warned you about the stairs, mari!!<. . i told you dog!
IT KEEPS HAPPENING
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS!
the noose ruse was a............. DISTACTION. . i HAVE the violin 
man omori was a really good game, i might get back to 100%-ing Super Mario Galaxy after I get all of the endings!
that was a great joke wdym, falling = funny >!because mari falling down the damn stairs is peak comedy!<
>!I actually thought of the joke because of the bad ending credits cutscene but that fits aswell lol!<
oh yes that too lol
I didn't know the background was different in dark mode, I assumed the white one was always used for images with transparent backgrounds. I'll keep it in mind whenever I get the chance to make more of these.. . It also means you can't see Mari's hair moving around slightly in the jumprope one, which was a last-minute addition because I realized she looked too static.
Mari's hair is a bit darker than the actual dark background, so that has no issues.
these are so cool!! you seem to be a little hard on yourself but i didn't even notice any of the "flaws" you talked about in your other comment, i was just focused on how cool i thought the edits were. especially happy with the sequel to mari cocking a gun, maybe you should do one like that with each of the main group!
>!Is it mari?!<
Ayo the pizza here
Ayo the cake here
Fuck yeah
Hate to burst your bubble, but I'm pretty sure that's Mari in the corner, meaning this is the timeline where she lived.. . In other words, we still don't know what happens after The Truth comes out.
no, shut tf up
Let's beat him up!
YES
***Sick battle theme***
sigh...I have bad news.... . [
Well, actually Aubrey has pink hair which she didnt have when Mari was, u know, soooo i don't believe that's Mary in the corner
The plan was to dye her hair with Mari. Mari was going to dye her hair purple, whilst Aubrey dyed her hair pink.
True, but we never get to see Mari with purple hair soo it's reasonable to say they didnt get the chance to do it together
>!yeah they didnt get the chance 'cause she fuckin died lmao!<
Hence my assertion that this takes place in a timeline where Mari still lives. If she were still alive, then they would have dyed their hair together. In the game timeline she dyed her hair in memory of Mari.
Makes sense lmao, I just didn't think about the alternative time thing
Dammit you were right :(
is that mari on the  left with purple hair?
As Mari said not everything we think makes sense, so we should not take it with too literally or place it on a golden scale.
I’m not saying she’s Bi, these pfps don’t necessarily follow the character’s actual sexuality, I just made this pfp for Pride Month because I kin Mari and I’m Bi.
It looks amazing 
Thanks!
Yipeee bi mari bi mari.
I read that as “bye Mari, bye Mari” >!the sun shined brighter when she was here!< 
Yippeeeeeee :D
It looks amazing
Thanks!
Your welcome!
Me when bisexual and Mari kin:
Bye mari. 
 She likes boys and girls equally
Yeah! Like me!
Hey jsyk you should give credit to the person who made the original art, still cool as hell though happy pride month
Oh yeah, the art was made by OMOCAT, originally made for Mari’s birthday, but I edited it and put some cool things such as a bisexual flag.
It was made this year for Mari's birthday!
I love when things like this happens in fandoms. They may fight about a character's gender or preferences, but everyone silently agrees that ONE SPECIFIC CHARACTER has a SPECIFIC PREFERENCE and no one fights about it.. . I already heard multiple times the HC that Mari is bi and everyone did agree, including me. (After all im bi too lmfao). . Amazing pfp also. Based bi Mari 
Yeah, I really love when there isn’t fights about lgbtq+ traits on characters.. . Also I’m bisexual aswell, and I’m a Mari kin, so that’s why I chose Mari for the pfp.
Bi mari my beloved
Same here.. . Since I kin her lol, I obviously feel identified with Bi Mari.
This looks sooooo good! I’m bi myself, so it works perfectly! 
wait why did someone downvote this?
Idk. Biphobe lurker, probably. I’m not too bent out of shape over it though.
Not too bent out of shape, but we're all a little bent out of shape here, the shape being a line. . Please get this joke I'm literally begging you
I think I get it. We’re all GAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
FRRRR 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Haha. "Bi yourself." By yourself.
Thanks!
Gorgeous. Wonderful. AMAZING. Mari is my favorite character.
It’s so pretty!!!
Thank you so much!
Really subtle edits! I like the way they blend in with the original work while not overbearing it.. . Happy pride!
Happy pride!. . Also thanks!
Me = Bisexual Mari. . Since I’m Bisexual and a Mari kin, it’s funny if you think it
AWWW



Permission to use this? I'll give credit.
Sure!
Thank you!
Holy Shit Marbi 
but i thought mari was straight
I used Fact: Mari for the bisexual thing since I’m a Mari kin and relate to her.
Wow, so many upvotes! :D
Pride month or not, people apparently make these things all the same, at the same rate.. . No offense, just something i noticed.
Alright?
Yup, I’m Bi. 
Based Mari. 
Woah talking to my alt.
So cool!
Schizophrenic moment.

True
Not everything has to be gay
It's bi
Not everything HAS to be, but it's objectively better when it is 
ohhh my gawd hard fucking smash
Lol.
I love this
Thank you so much!
Really Cute
Thank u!
Your welcome
Nice  (I'm bi, I wish I could tell the important people in my life)
Thanks!
*stairs.*
No u.
New AU just dropped *insert varients of Anarchy Chess jokes here*
Fr
Yep, looks good.. . &#x200B;. . Particularly because it would indicate that Mari likes both boys and girls :)
True, just like me, I do aswell like both genders and I kin for her, that’s why I chose her
Wow, interesting short history you have there.
very nice, i like it 
Yooo i was just lookinh for a bi pfp
omg it's marbi
Stealing this for my discord >:D
I can't unsee Mari than anything else than sunny with long hair and **eyelashes**
She's so cute 😭 my heart is melting
: what?
why is mari's evil twin Mori never acknowledged anywhere else in the game? Plot hole??
Mori is just Mari and omori fused.
I'll create one when I'll be done practicing ^^. Also looking for a Mari to play on the piano
Yay!! Please let us know! I’m going to support you!! :)
>!but wasn't sunshine Mari x Sunny? Sunset sounds like the opposite so I assumed it was with Mari being dead since sunset is spoilered. Is it Kel x Hero then?!<
i've actually seen quite alot of names, but none of them ever seem to stick except *HeroMari*, for some reason.  . here's a list i compiled over time:  . \- *HeroMari*   . \- *Mario*  . \- *Roselily*  . \- *Rosemari*  . \- *Picnic Basket*  . \- *Picnic Sandwich*
Don't forget the best one: >!"*Cook Something*"!<
I like that one!!
I thought I was smart for saying Maro..
I love the "Mario" one, it's so funny 🤣🤣

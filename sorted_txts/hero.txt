This is 10/10 lmfao. . Hero just in the corner of the screen cowering in fetal postion is my favorite part
Hero needs to stop being a fucking mood /nm
*Wear the* "[random hero fan]()" *shirt to confuse non-omori fans and the* "[omori?]()" *shirt to make them think that you're edgy!*
She's holding hero hand so it's not a ghost
And Hero has got the pan
And Omori has the knife.   Well, not that anyone was expecting otherwise.
And something just looking at the squad from under the ground
And this is all Cherry on the Top. Absolutely wonderful
Except hero is cooking eggs instead of making cookies
I mean Eggs do taste delicious
i absolutely love the concept of hero frantically trying to cook eggs for his friends while a raging battle is on-going
Seeing Hero trying to dish out as many eggs as possible reminds me of the first time I went into the fight. Underleveled af and literally just prayed Hero could tank and heal everything to win. Took way longer than I should have.
Wow.. This art is really fantastic! Everything just looks really good! Especially Hero lol. Thank you for gracing us with this wonderful piece!
The fact that hero is just frantically cooking while in a battle-
This made me think of hero frantically making food while the small platform crumbles beneath them and a gigantic swole planet stands before them
"Hero why are you making eggs?"
HERO LOVE HER. AND YOU KILLED HER
Canon hero meme
Hero is the healer so i have him rabbits foot 🗿
Same, I used Hero as a support since a lot of his skills are healing related. Not to mention most of his equipment pieces increase his juice
I usually just use hero if I know none of my team is in danger of dying in that turn before he can act, but if the health is like below 2/3 and I’m fighting a strong foe I’m gonna have kel throw a whole pizza at everyone cause he’s the fastest. This was very few and far between though cause kel quickly became a huge damage dealer for me when his follow up moves leveled up and I needed his “pass to hero” in order to take care of multiple enemies at once. If I needed someone to heal the party that’s not hero I’d usually use Aubrey due to her being built like a brick wall (especially with a high defense charm), but even that was rare since I needed her power hit to take out sad foes (or just enemies with insane defense) and her mood wrecker to take down happy foes (was literally the biggest contributor to the sweetheart fight)
What are you guys? HERO?
Kinda
Ok
plus hero and sans both makes puns you forget this
Oh my gosh. Sans is hero?
But that's just a theory
a game theory
The photo in sans's basement proves it
Kel with Papyrus. Hero with Mettaton, especially headspace Hero but headspace Hero is based on Real Hero so it works
Capeless hero
yeah i dont think i remember him having one
Like someone said above, Hero may have blamed himself for Mari's death. But knowing Hero, he wouldn't lose his temper over an accident, for something that has happened years ago.
Except for spiders, of course.
are you real? sunny been a hikikomori for 4 years or whatever and now he shared with his friends what he couldn't even admit to himself. It's only up from here. with or without hero. **a** **life without hero is better than a life with omori**
I can see that, but honestly it might actually help Hero. As awful as the truth is atleast in the end her death was an accident.. . I'm sure a big part of his depression is feeling that despite loving her so much he couldn't see problems that would lead to a suicide and I bet he harbored a ton of guilt for not "seeing the signs".. . Knowing that she really was happy being alive could mean a lot to him.
Yup, from what I gathered from the game and my knowledge of psychiatry, Hero is basically a perfect example of the Sublimation coping strategy. . . Meaning he takes his emotions and sorrow, and puts that energy into socially acceptable and constructive behavior. Studying being an A student, going to med school. . . I couldnt see someone with a mature coping strategy going apeshit on Sunny and Basil.
This is an excellent silver lining. Knowing that Hero thought he messed up by not picking up on anything while Mari never actually hung herself was eating away at me until I got the true ending.
I would, but I'm with you on how Hero might actually do that. The guy bottles up his emotions like the sniper from tf2 bottles up his piss.
That is a wonderful comparison.
absolute worst case is a repetition of the game through the perspective of another character, though i doubt that someone like hero would go that far
You should also take note that Hero was reaaaally hurt, in Kel's retelling of how Hero's first year went, it really shows how much Mari's death hurt him. He probably wouldn't resort to frikin murder, but I think he'd feel that way
This is amazing, lmao. I don’t think Hero would take it this badly but this is the best depiction of this outcome I’ve seen
Welp, Hero is going to the prison.. . He's an adult and he clearly has a reason/motive to look at this as a murder and not manslaughter.
I GOT SO SCARED I THOUGH HERO ACTUALLY SNAPPED Thank god it's just fanart
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES
a reaction like HOW DARE YOU PUSH MY BELOVED DOWNSTAIRS YOU FREAKING BRAT is not something heroish guys 
And Hero
Agreed tbh, Hero is hot asf
This makes me want to ship Polly and Hero even more.
why would you do that
He's gotta move on eventually
Moving on is indeed hard for the poor college student, some fans have even embraced good ol Ghost Mari X Hero just because they want the poor boy to be happy, I honestly think moving on is gonna be impossible for him.
> I honestly think moving on is gonna be impossible for him.. . For anyone? Ever? That's a pretty depressing outcome
Both are nice and sweet people and would prob get along.. . We dont rly know anything about her interest etc but that aint stopped shipping before
There was this blind date fan fic of hero and Polly and despite the age gap it was really sweet. I hope the writer keeps it up
Polly and hero would make a great couple
"Hero please stop crying."
Hero tagged you
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES
BOSSMANHERO SAYS THIS IS CANNON
BOSSMANHERO APPROVES
I imagine Hero during this event stunned by her beauty, elegance and charm and all she does is tease his reaction because of it.
POV: >!you are Hero!<. . also nice drawing :D
Omori doing the Hero smile is definetely blursed
He has a son, his name is Hero. XD
Yeah I got omori a few weeks ago and still have no idea where to go after the >! Hero coming home !< thing so everything is mostly a spoiler for me
NONONONONO. . . MC AS HERO AND YURI AS BAGEK🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
"She's... she's...!. ... IN LOVE WITH HERO!!"
Mari and Hero are such a comfort couple I love them sm
*audible gasp*
*insert "therocksus.mp4"*

POLLY CONTENT?!?!?!?. . Also I like how the comments are people finally being able to simp for a Real World character other than Hero lmao
> what a hero. . uhhh that's his brother
Goddamn how in denial are you? Obviously if I assume in real life if two friends are dating without asking, there's room for error. However at most that's gonna lead to a slightly awkward correction and that's it, it's not that big a deal and definitely not "setting myself up for disaster".. . That doesn't change the fact however that romance is pretty easy to read, and it really isn't subtle in Hero's and Mari's relationship. In reality if you assumed you'd probably be right, but sure you should double check. This isn't real life though, they're fictional characters that we can't actually ask, as you mentioned, but it's again something that's extremely implied by the writing. You are literally ignoring an obvious theme because it technically has room to subvert expectations. Why at all would their relationship and intimacy be so focused, to the point where Hero makes a romantic compliment, to the point where Mari says they have a "magic", to the point where all that's said after Mari asks if Hero would've said yes to marrying Sweetheart with a distinct interest. They are very clearly romantically involved, whether officially togethet or just interested in each other, but the game goes out of its way to show how intimate and caring they are for each other, on top of actual flirting. No one is that intimate with someone they aren't interested in. Not to mention, Headspace Hero and Mari are 15 while the rest of the group is 12, its possible they are dating but just didn't think to mention it to the friends. After all Kel still believes in cooties. . . >If you don't know how conversations work and you think a single romantically implied comment means the conversation is romantic overall then I think I'm done with this.. . That is not at all what I did in the slightest, and your one-sided view here is just proof of how you're intentionally not looking into the details of Hero and Mari's writing. I not once said that only Hero's compliment made the conversation romantic, I actually analyzed it. I point out how Mari teased him afterwards and made Hero flustered, how Mari clearly saw and stated with that "magic" comment what was between them as special and more than just friendship. And I'm sorry you're just straight up lying about the meaning behind Hero's flirting line. "Only have eyes for you" is an inherently romantic line used to say that you are only romantically interested in that person.
You know what? You've convinced me actually and I relinquish all my past arguments. You are correct and I apologize for my rude behaviour.Since you seem to know a romantic relationship so well, even better than me, could I ask for your help?You see I have this girl friend, who I think is such a lovely person. She comes from out of state, but whenever we hang out we always give each other kisses. We often watch netflix together and she loves to watch romantic movies with me. 2 weeks ago she fell asleep on my shoulder during a movie. Are we basically dating at this point? Have we developed feelings for each other? I'm very confused so could you please tell me what's going on? You seem to know so much more about this stuff than me.

It's kinda weird how mad you're getting about this, but I'll humor you.. . You guys are not officially dating, no. You haven't discussed it with her. However if you're at the point where you're literally kissing each other It's pretty clear you two have developed feelings and for some reason or another you haven't actually made it official.. . And before you come after me about how this proves you're right and consent and blah blah, your example is completely irrelevant from the topic at hand. I have made it explicitly clear that looking as an outsider into a relationship between two characters is not the same as being in that relationship nor even playing a character in that relationship.
Ok I was watching the game again and found this so if you somehow still don't think it's obvious Hero and Mari were romantically involved, Basil literally calls them "a match made in heaven" in one of the photos.
As a random hero fan I also thought it was a joke LOL
Omori = Goth. . Hero = Jock. . I'm not sorry. . >!ALSO A JOKE!<
On this episode of Omori, Sunny causes a kitchen fire by following the vague instructions of Hero
exactly as told
Following the direct instructions of Omori who lives for **chaos**
Omori is my favourite slice of life anime
Truue
i. yeah. it boiled over.
Hero said to **observe**. . Never to warn. . Sunny only followed orders
Good soldiers follow orders
Good soldiers follow orders
This image reminds me of Asriel following the pie recipe exactly as he interpreted it!
My headcanon is that in the Omori universe Hero has a cooking show on YouTube called "Hungry With Hero" where he recreates foods from popular movies and TV shows. But he still has hair, don't worry
that’s... beautiful
Did you by any chance read the fanfic Playing Hero?
What is it about?
I mean he did his job... Great art!
Pretty much my level of helpfulness in the kitchen.
ok but fr what are you supposed to do when it overflows. im genuinely clueless
we panicked, moved the pot, and threw down a towel, but forgot to turn the stove off so it didn’t end well.
I think the best you can do at that point is to turn the heat off so it doesn't boil over more.
just throw a whole fucking cat in that shit they love milk let them drink it enough to make sure it doesnt overflow, and then remove them like a minute later. . &#x200B;. . happy to help
Cats cant digest milk
My cat seems to be fine whenever he ambushes my cereal
Like They Say He Would Not Notice Anything
Just like zoologists spectating the animal world!
I love this image so much
I mean, he ***did*** watch the pot
I love this, very accurate
Do you take commissions
Sorry, I’m still very new to drawing so I wouldn’t be comfortable. Maybe in the future?
its the future, do you take commissions?
pinoy kids when their yaya asks them to watch the rice
Correction, Hero has to spend hours cleaning that stove.
Well I mean, he didn't /not/ watch the pot
I love how these comics even look like the omori cutscenes, these are the blessing this subreddit needs
This is so adorable, your style is too gorgeous! ♥️
It was rice, wasn't it?
irl it was chicken
it do be like that sometimes
And now the entire house is flooded with boiling water
i mean, he did exact what hero told him to do lel
Canon post ending
Good pot…
Omori knows how to cook, ask him how to cook a steak 🥱
well he did watch it
Source?
sorry, i might be misunderstanding your question but i made this.
Thanks!
I had to burst in while this was happening and turn off the pot, lets just say Hero got a bit mad at Sunny for that...
At least he would be good at cutting the vegetables.
Must be rice
I mean, he watched the pot tho
he did say to watch it, not to stop it from getting out of control
Ralsei is Hero and Lancer is Kel  . (although actually ralsei is more of a mix of hero and basil)

This lad just woke up and chose violence

NP I LOVE THAT COMIC
Hey, it's actually pretty good tho
This is so cute and explains nothing as to how to make some of the dishes lol
... That's about what we should've expected from a 12 year old, come to think of it.
Hero is 15 no?
yeah headspace hero is like, 15 years old, according to Sprout Mole Mike
What do you mean just eyeball them
Im gonna try orange Joe irl just to see how horrible it tastes
I'll arrange your funeral
It’s deathly
Oh look a sweet jelly filled donut.
I CAN FINALLY MAKE THE HERO SANDWICH
Orange Joe sounds kind of meh. I prefer a delicious glass of pilk
of.. of what?
Pilk. Pepsi Milk. If you're feeling spicy you may add some mustard to it
This man here, officer. Guilty of first degree food crimes.
Here’s the tweet: 
Orange joe omg now it makes so much sense, orange for orange juice and joe as in a cup of joe
so fricking cute and wholesome. happy birthday hero and happy new years

He boutta turn the Geneva Convention into the Geneva Suggestion
the sandwich and grilled eggplants actually look good
Malewife hero is canon now
Always has been
*So it's the same kind of book as Ralsei's manual*
That apron is cute
Don't lie . You know he looks cute in the apron...
If I had any orange juice, I’d be doing unspeakable things to it right now
Neat
This is awesome!!! I’ve always wanted to try something that was made in Omori! Just not… the orange joe…
Hero is the best cooker
Finally, Orange Joe recipe
OMORI'S ONIGIRI? I'm confused, all I see are jelly-filled donuts.
THIS IS AMAZING!!!! Thanks for sharing this!
THIS IS SO CUTE
Thanks I will proceed to eat only this for the rest of my life
I expected Orange Joe to be sweeter, tbh.
Now I can eat depression!
I feel like the sandwiches are covered in jam-
Don't lie . You know he looks cute in the apron...
Hero: I made a recipes for Mari’s cookies!. . Basil: Wow, it tastes exactly the same!. . Hero: Thanks! The recipe is-. . Hero:*gets sniped from a distance*. . Mari: B U L L S E Y E
I feel Omori would sometimes just slap on either slightly wet, or completely uncooked rice to make his Onogiri...
I don't care if I'm called sus, I WOULD let Hero clap these cheeks.
Mr. Plantegg noooooooo
OH NO
If it tastes bad it’s normal✨💅

Xcom 2 is an rpg bois.. . Now, hades does have some of the other rpg elements (interactions with persistent npcs, personal upgrades, etc) but these are really not the mechanical core of Hades (roguelite action dungeon-crawler), nor do they have the reach and effect you expect when you call it “An RPG.” It’s like calling a roguelite a roguelike for more sensitive people. Or like calling RTS preset campaigns (SC, CW, HOI) rpg’s. Make decisions, interact with npcs (nova/whatshisnamethespectre), persistent upgrades for your group, hero characters that must not die. I would bring up warcraft but I haven’t played it myself, only watched some.
You (or one of the very heroic antis here) reported me to Reddit Care Resources lol
Will we see Tom Cruise as Hero? 
Of course. And Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as Hector.

I like how Hero seens upset, Kel  awkward, Sunny ashamed while Aubrey has a face of "I recognize that what I did was not too kind, but this doesn't means that I regret it all....or that I haven't enjoyed the moment"
I call that a “Bruh moment “

This is awesome, but >!didn't Hero want to become a chef?!<
Hero wanted to >!become a chef in Headspace because that's what Sunny remembers from Hero irl, but after ***the incident*** he changed his mind and wanted to become a doctor!<
Hero wanted to >!become a chef IRL too, but the dream died with Mari and he caved to his parents' desire for him to study to be a doctor. One of the Memory Lane sequences has Hero and Mari talking about their future!<.
He can also be a nutritionist doctor 
I like that idea lol
In my headcanon Hero is toxicologist (because he looks like Chubbyemu and I don't care that Hero is Mexican and not Asian lmao) and Basil is Guitar Hero streamer (because he looks like JasonParadise).
Man I love Hero

Yes
Hero keeps breaking all the leaves from my trees
Hero?
Herobrine?
I’m sorry little one
Guys it's true you can spawn him by crafting the hero sandwich, putting an item frame on a block of solesand and putting it into the item frame but it breaks ur game
What about >!Heroin?!<
He must grant his body to Herobrine for an hour every night in order to stay as Hero.
If we look at it from the stance that Kel is actually the original user who made a post about Herobrine, then that would be one of Hero's few acts of being a bad older brother. They must all be purged.
Thought this was a meme about either big hero 6, darling in the franxx, or snow crash at first. This is a nice surprise though
Isn't Hero's actual name Henry? In the game it says that Hero is a nickname given to him because of his favourite sandwich.
Thats his cover story
oh no thats who haunt my old xbox 360 world IT WAS YOU HERO
What are you doing Hero?
You are my hero man. (For context: I made the original post asking for this)

Hero is the ultimate malewife for Mari (If she's still hanging around ofc)
what a sweet young man

So cute 🥺🥹
The little earrings 🥺💕
Missing dream world sequence actually 😭 (ik it’s the real world plushie but still this seems like something that would happen in the dream world)
malewifecore
This is canon Hero.

She gave him OMORI themed studs!!!!!!!
YAZ!!!
LOL even the earrings
He’s the real manwife!
Damn the got the cooking mama drip
Aww

Harry styles b like:
He looks like Doña Florinda. Aww
Beautiful.
He's so cute OMG 😭

Aww, he looks so cute 
LMAOOOOOOOO LOLLLLL HES LOOKS SOOOOOO CUTE

I knew he was the mom of the group
№1 best cooking outfit 
good mom
That is so adorable
That’s adorable.
W mom
Your mom is cooking fr 👅👅👅
Hero once again having the patience of a saint.
lmao the last one got me 🤣
I'm taller than Hero is, but I imagine him roaring that would be fairly intimidating.
why is hero so short lol
the boi likes to feel **extra** comfy in his car seat
As someone who is terrified of cars, I feel that last one. With experience does not come security. The anxiety remains.
I feel similar. I just calm myself  by thinking that I just need to follow the rules and be prepared for everyone to break them.
Really this is a good thing. Assuming you aren't on hard drugs, driving is the most dangerous thing you regularly do, by a longshot.
AU where Hero is the only short one everyone else is buff giants
Lol
I love this fandom
This. This is my favorite Omori post
It made me laugh so hard lmao 🤣
Are people with a single eye even allowed to drive? No depth perception on the road is dangerous.
Nah, everyone who read the foe facts know that who telled the joke is hero
Photoshop her out of that and into a dark-lit room and unto a bed and you'll get Hero's POV.
Hero is so cute :3
Hero looks like the early stages of a white suburban dad or in simpler terms, George from young sheldon
Hero x Henry 
>!Masturbation.!<

Self love
He really needs some
Agreed

You  put in bossman something and headspace hero and mari but where’s hero and henry

Completely agree
Headspace hero is based 💀
: OH REALLY? YOU WOULDN’T MIND IF I TOLD HERO, THEN, WOULD YOU?
  NO DONT TELL HERO HE WILL TELL MY MOM
: Well, then, stop using Hector as a FUCKING FLESHLIGHT and *MAYBE* I’ll let you go!
  hey sunny I escaped the headspace and I need to find hero... I'm gonna fuck him. .  WHO THE HELL IS THAT
 You know what, fuck this shit.. . 🔫 Goodbye.. . 💥🔫
  hey guys I'm back so umm fun fact: kel was taking the blame for hero... Yeah hero fucked hector
And that’s how our story ends. A criminal got away, while three innocents lay dead, and two perverts run free. Truly a tragic tale.
Yes... Anyone want a sequel
Here me out on this one: Hero X Something. . IT WOULD BE THE FUNNIEST CRACK SHIP EVER

I’m pretty sure that ship was made entirely as a joke in the first place. And yeah, I agree with you, it would be hilarious.
I ship Hero.... . . With himself. Self love and self care are important.
Hero x Polly?
It is… **acceptable.**
Ah, hero the necrophiliac
It’s either necromancy, going back in time, or Hero is lonely. Take your pick.
Legend has that if these two piles are to mix, calamity shall fall above the land. The skies will darken, the land will crack with fear, and all hope will be lost. Only three heroes at the edge of the world shall return the balance:. . One human, one monster and one prince of the dar-. . . Wait this is the wrong game

[Hero when you sexualize his 15 year old girlfriend]()
Bro I’m not gonna do that,no need to call a Squad Raid on my house  .
Have a look at the rest of this comment section and "Very good looking Big Sis". Why am I getting downvoted for not wanting people to get rock hard for a fucking 15 year old
Alright then   . . It's just that seeing as this is Reddit I'm used to looking at any post of a pretty woman being filled with thirst from OP and the comment section both, so I'm pretty on edge
Whatever it is it’s Hero’s
i absolutely love how beautiful this is! hero being flustered is so cute 
AAAA TYSM!!💖  . . . hero is always cute when flustered i agree
My "Hero" Academia crossover, I see.
HEHE you have all my respects for getting the reference!!!
I'm more surprised that no one made this joke tbh-
Hero's reaction would totally be me if I had a girlfriend.. . . Heh heh. If.
Is that a My Hero Academia reference?
YEPPP IT ISSS  you get my respects for noticing!!
IIRC it's in one of Black Space 2 rooms during Hikikomori route (specifically the room where headspace Hero asked Omori to retrieve some items i believe)
Hero nose bleeding lol
what does the nosebleed mean I'm dense for romantic stuff
Anime thing, don’t worry about it
a friend told me about it lol
They cant really show boners so the nose bleed replaces that
it rushes towards his di-
Hero having the mf nose bleed lmao
Hero is now Russian, becuz he has a \*\*MEDIC GF\*\*
Now I want an omori x tf2 crossover
There's a video in TF2 where Scout and Soldier reenacted da Beeg Truth, and someone just replied "omori"
I hope you mean that in a wholesome way or else Hero WILL bonk you...
With a cast iron.

We will fight to the deaths
>!Just like Hero! They do receive each other !😢!<
the question still stands user heroswordkein
Name Kien. . Nick name: Herosword (you can understand as Hero Sword)
Hero = Makoto (P3MC). . Basil = Yukari. . Kel = Junpei. . Aubrey = Mitsuru. . Edit: I thought Hero was Shinji, oops
This is beautiful.
Hero is Makoto Yuki actually
Hero is the protagonist of P3 not Shinji
We all know hero's just gonna get exhausted after a few steps
Ha! This bot is great.
Good bot
I think I might just commission one of my two favorites of the gang in the style of the [PV.]()  Sunny or Hero. (probably Hero, because the whole. Grades motif. 「A」「D」iykyk). . But thank you for the kind words 
The one where she guilt trips the hell out of Hero for not wanting to be glued to her side as soon as he gets home? It made me so uncomfortable too, hit way too close to home.
if you were a "gifted" kid you may also relate on how hero's parents wishes for him to be a doctor without questioning him even when he wants to be a cook. i bet hero, the people pleaser he is goes along with it because of the pressure
It was the opposite for me during that scene actually aha, my siblings and I are 23/16/6 with me being the oldest so I was skeeved out by their mom being Like That, but I was just sighing and nodding along with Hero the whole time lmfao. I've had my fair share of "yes, ma, I'll be your coparent next time I see you, just lemme take the SG out for a fun day and then you can have all my attention when we get home" negotiations over the years. It's a fine line you have to walk, figuring out how to balance the "SG deserves nothing" and "GC has to get what they want" in your N's brain so you can actually give the kid a day of freedom. . . Moving out actually gives you so much more pull too, I was never allowed to take my little sibling farther than the corner store when we were both living at home because "they'll cause too much trouble out and about!!" but now that I've moved out, I can leverage time with me to get permission to take my sibling anywhere I want. We have sleepovers at least once a month and I got to take them to Pride a state away earlier this month :) and all it cost was a few hours of gardening with Nmom. . It sucks and it makes me feel manipulative sometimes but I tell myself it's okay because it gets SG out of the house for a little while 🙃 sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire yknow? It's for a good cause :p. . Sorry for rambling lol it's so easy to infodump about N dynamics, tldr Hero girlboss moment and I love it for him
You really are a good sibling  unfortunately for me, nothing like mine!. . And it's okay I actually trimmed that message down because I almost rambled about my own N dynamics 
They are better than most omori parents but they do have slight favoritism towards hero (though even that is excusable because the scene where it was implied Hero had been in a deep depression for several weeks)
Not much honestly its just fanbase blowing stuff out of proportion.. . It aint their fault kel has no awards or trophies.. . Hero has been gone to college for a while so of course they want to see him and act a bit clingny.. . Of course they priortise hero when he was depressed likely bding scared he would kill himself.. . Are they perfect? No. Is hero favored to an extent? Yeah probably.. . Do they still love both their kids and just wish the best for them even if they aint perfect ib their approach? Yeah probably
Tbh I kinda thought they were pretty bad too. Not to the level of Sunny, Aubrey and Basil’s parents, but they always gave Hero more attention and when Hero returned to visit, the mom sorta guilt tripped him iirc?
What the hero parents did to you 😡
This is probably the reason why Hero likes her

(hero would go on his phone to see that he received a voicemail and he listens to it)
(Hero listens to the voicemail.). . : Oh, that's unfortunate. I should go to the hospital.... . (Hero walks out the door, and sees Aubrey standing in his driveway.)
: what do you want, bitch?
(hero would look down at the floor)
: .... . : Waiting for something to happen?
(hero would ignore mari's voice)
: Oh, come on! You haven't seen me in years! Even a "hi" would suffice at this point.. . : .... . : Okay, then. If you don't want to talk, then that's fine with me.. . : ...
: this voice is just a-
: Just a what? A hallucination? A mirage?
: a memoir...
: A memory...? Sure, that tracks. . . : Anyways, I think Kel's awake now.. . : See you later, Hero.

: Oh, okay! I'll go get him in a second.
: thx

HEROin???
Tell me what would be the drugs that would rhyme with the names of the Omori characters
In here Hero is looking brutal. . In game he is the weakest attacking. . What an irony
yeah but that's stat-wise, "pass to hero" is by far the best follow-up in the game
True
I imagine Hero was like Hank in the garage scene when  Walt confronted him
Hero: “I don’t… I don’t even know who I’m talking to…”. Sunny: “If that’s true… if you don’t know who I am… then your best course.. would be to **tread lightly.**”

GET THE FUCK OUTTA MILWAUKEE
IS THAT A MILWAUKEE SCREWDRIVER REFERENCE ?!
no its a reference to my hometown
No I realized, I just tried to be funny.
Unpopular opinion, but I think kel and hero are a Latino/Asian mix because hero has a slightly lighter skin tone and darker hair 
I feel like Hero mentioning the reason for not climbing the ladders before seems... well, also a bit odd.
Hero, stop it
: I think ill go get Hero...
: Huh?

Not true because he described Hero’s bed as perfect. I do like the bed-rater game though
the more important question is. . . . if Hero isn’t pregnant anymore what is he doing outside of the kitchen
The world may never know.

Hero is 19 (and this post is very obviously a joke lol)
Hero is legit an adult huh 😭
“HERO! I have a question for you... Was there any chance in the world that you would've said ‘yes’ to marrying SWEETHEART?”  . “What!? No way! You know I only have eyes for you, MARI...”  . “HERO! That's not what I like about you at all!”  . “What? It's not? Then what is it?”  . “I can't tell you that, silly! It would ruin the magic!”
Actual dialogue's from the game, and probably an actual conversation that hero and mary had infront of all
Well hero was born sometime in the 90's so by doing math we can assume that it takes place any time between 2009 and 2019 in the main game
Where in-game is it said that Hero was born in the '90s?
Ah yes, the sequel to "Hero tagged you"
Brazilian Aubrey drawn like this? Great. 👍. . In my mind, her personality would be Kel 2.0 but with a more focused vibe and far less goofy.. . Maybe her weapon would be a soccer ball? Or maybe she is a cooking rival to Hero, with an amazing *Moqueca* versus Hero’s *Caldo de Res*.
hero how could you.........at least you didn't remind him ellen exists the worst thing a person can do.
>!I'm headcanonning that they'll forgive them. Hero definetely would, because he would agree to much bigger things just for his friends to be happy. So would Kel, he wouldn't really care, I mean, would for a little time, but then understand things and move on. Not sure about Aubrey. But she probably would, too, as long as everyone ( not everyone ) is back and they are well, after some talking, especially Hero explaining her some important things, she would definetely get over it. At least, that's what I think.!<
>!I honestly think Aubrey would be one of the first to forgive Sunny since otherwise she would be a dang hypocrite. After what she'd almost done to Basil AND indirectly to Sunny at the lake if there wasn't Hero to save the day, she would also be in an even worse position with a) double the body count, b) her being 16 and c) a delinquent.!<. . >!Hero would be less forgiving, I think. In the end I also think he will forgive. It would take just a longer time than the others!<
>!I think Hero will come around as he gets to know that it wasn't his fault, for "not noticing" whatever made Mari suicidal.!<
Hero definitely wouldn't be less forgiving
Not bald Hero... 🥀

La tipica ragazza italiana che ti sfonda a mazzate e prega in chiesa.. . &#x200B;. . But seriously lol, so random. Hero feels more italian if we go by that stereotype.. . &#x200B;. . Not like i would expect much sense from this kind of thread, but oh well.

They have a crush on you. Gifting each other fake hero plushies is a sign of love.
WAIT YOU HAVE THE SUCTION CUP HERO TOO?
They tried to be your HERO
i am no untrustworthy liar😔trust me😔the person sits a few seats away from me at my lunch table and stares at me and knows of my hero obsession😔i wear strictly hero omori clothing!!! I am no liar😔
i lock my omori obsession up
My dude became so famous for their Hero shrine, it spread to their school
lol same thing happened to a friend of my friend, but instead of a Hero plush they randomly gave him a cake slice. He gave it to me and my bff, yes we ate the cake and it was good :3. . ANYWAYS THIS IS A SIGN THEY WANNA BE UR FRIEND, ACCEPT IT
if someone gave me a hero plushie even a knockoff one i would fall in love instantly 😍
Something tells me you like hero, idk what
I feel like Hero would've mentioned that he had to buy it/bring it, and ask why Sunny's fridge was empty. It would be a concerning sight on its own to see your pale, thin friend after he shut himself up for four years, and everyone acknowledges that it is concerning and Hero says himself he should've done more to keep the gang together. It's not in Hero's character to ignore something like that.
Probably Hero bought food himself? On one day left it was Tuesday, since Three days left was a Sunday, so the stores must be open. Ok nvm anyways, the storee are always open in america xD
The phone call from his mom only specified that the lights would go out, not the power. . . and he can't be hallucinating it because 1. He's not even the one who uses the oven, it's Hero who uses that. . 2. The ceiling fan still spins even after he's dead, and I doubt you can hallucinate while being dead.. and 3. You can use the computer with Aubrey, Kel and Hero following you, and none of them question why Sunny is pretending to use a computer that doesn't work
That makes sense. Thanks. :). . I'm gonna have to replay the game soon. Probably when fall rolls around again.
hero smol
wher
Hero actually is just so small he's hard to see (not a joke).
You mean the black ghost to the left?
Now I am imagining her singing Plastic Love in front of Hero
Yeah… more for hero though in my eyes… he looks like he’s 30 or 40 😭😭
It's as much of an rpg guitar hero
Kind of a late reply to my comment, but people's perceptions of her in-universe are what I was going off of there. The people in the church directly equate her father leaving with her becoming uncontrollable, and explicitly don't spare her any sympathy in their commentary, so assuming they're being empathetic toward her is no less presumptive in context. Plus, the idea of a parent being controlling is hardly a foreign one, nor especially unrealistic. We explicitly have multiple examples in-universe with Mari and Sunny's dad being known to be the type to get mad if Mari was seen being too close to Hero, and Kel and Heros mom is on the more demanding side as well. Plus there are side characters like Kim and Vances mom who are similar, so the concept is clearly reiterated. Not to say they're all bad parents, mind, Kel and Heros mom is alright, and we know barely anymore about Sunnys dad than we do about Aubrey's. And just to be clear, being controlling and being abusive are not being conflated here; I'm only arguing that we have some evidence that may support a reading of them as being on the demanding, controlling side of things, not that they're abusive control freaks or anything.. . The point, both of my first paragraph here and my comment further up, is this is the only info we have, and so people infer different potential meanings behind it. I was explaining the mindset that conveyed people's assumptions about him, not stating that he absolutely must've been as such. We know people in the church connect his leaving to Aubrey's uncontrollability, and the birthday picture seems to show her having to sneak out of her birthday to go with friends. Given her mom is found as a comatose drunk, people then determine that perhaps it was her father who led to her having to sneak out and in turn have the churchgoers that impression.
Ok sorry
>Murder. . thanks my hero
Love how hero's the only normal looking one.
They all look disturbingly normal to me, except for Bari
Isn’t hero’s real name Harry? So I guess heri is pretty close

Layout for reddit?
not rly, on twitter or something.
I love heroooo this is great
just give them hero's cookies and no one gets hurt.
Because Hero would clearly know how to spell gorgeouous
I see a ton of Aubrey here. The one I see the least is hero :( and whenever he is here it's usually with mari. We need a hero appreciation post over here
Agreed
I believe also if >!Kel and Hero are at Sunny's house, then you talk with Mari before Hero busts in and sorta just cucks you from talking more. If you go to the mirror, I think the same thing happens.!<
It does yeah
oh yeah, i forgot about happy's speed boost.. . while you're at it, use Hero's spicy food for extra damage. i say this because i always forget it exists.
Hero's skills are very easy to forget because you aren't going to use a large portion. The only ones you really need are cook, snack time, smile (I think that's the one that lowers attack lol), Tenderize, and maybe Gator aid. Although you get gator aid really late, so yeah...
I thought Hero was 19?
it was the 2nd time he came home from college in the game so
he is 15 in headspace, 15+4=19
I'll reply to myself, since I don't want to edit what I think is complete thought, but the fact that Hero's mother is completely unmoved by him saving lives of two of his friends, while at the same time steering him towards a career that is about saving lives, might show that she's invested in it for purely monetary and status reasons of having a doctor in the family.. . My own headcanon is that Hero gave up his dreams of being a cook during the argument with Kel that the latter mentions while on cemetery - Hero realized that his parents simply do not care about Kel's wellbeing and that what snapped him out of his depressive episode. That he needs to be the one to care about his little brother. That perhaps he might be in the better position to do it if he becomes a doctor like his parents wanted.
i like this apart from the fact that hero's mouth is on  one side of his face
Don’t
Their noses are also visible from the side but not the front, obviously meaning they must just be a really weird shape.
Is this a battle against Manlybadasshero??
Hero holding a gun is just so funny tbh. . 
Ahhh I don’t see Snufflin on here anymore lol
Fact he’s smiling as he does it too
Is hero driving them, or is the implication that hero doesn't need therapy?
I hope he's driving. Or he became the banjo
Hero needs his therapy, but I'm fine with banjo as an alternate
Hero, my favourite hydro healer
recognise them all except for the hero one 
Hero is literally me
No way.. I thought it’s some kind of hero on a mountain or something
Probably because Hero said "if you wanna be taller, drink milk"
The actual answer
Hero pov
Poor guy, we should help him sometimes whenever he's in a depressing mood
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to kill two people now
Woah, I understand HERO.
Same
Now I see why Hero chose her
POV: you are Hero
op is hero confirmed
Now i get Hero
r/FoundHero
Objection hero worked at the chemical factory he is 1cm smaller then he looks
Von karma, no!
Overtured!. . &#x200B;. . If Hero worked at the factory, then the smell of the chemicals got on Kel, making him 1cm smaller too
Eureka kel is 16 hero is 20 this kel will eventually our grow hero, additionally if sunny goes on a nice beefy diet he will match them
I will snatch Heros weave
Maybe so, but even the tallest cactus is still smaller than a tree like Hero /J
Hero literally has Fists equipped in his inventory
Bro just squares up, no weapon, no fancy gimmick, just catchin these hands
That means he can do the damage he does without the extra force inherent in punching, right? So if he did throw a proper punch would it do more than Hero’s?
his slap does like, 2 damage or something, meanwhile heros fists actually do some damage iirc
Ah, that’s fair, it’s been a long time since I played in faraway town so I forgot, and idk if I ever saw Hero fight anyone
"Gets the job done"
u/Nutwagon-SUPREMER *Rated E for Everyone*
however you do have to consider that its been shown many times that hero isnt athletically strong
Hero is an adult man, while Aubrey is a teenage girl. Also, I think Hero exercises. So I think hero is way stronger.
Nah. Hero is an adult male. Aubrey is a teen girl. Plus Hero exercises
It's obvious she's clearly stronger than Hero, how else can she easily pin him down for a kabedon?
For a what?
Kabedon, basically, pinning someone to a wall in a romantic way, if you can't visualize that, here's a visual aid.. . 
…did you just have that installed or something?
I made it in like, 2 minutes.

my personal theory is that irl hero is the strongest, but headspace hero has less attack because omori constructs him as a kind pacifist, like how sunny perceived him
This is supported by that one encounter with the scarecrow where he got provoked and Hero knocks the thing out of its stand and immediately gains like 50+ attack stat.
aw that's so cute
19 year old Hero saved two teenagers from drowning and carried the other one back home. He's definitely far from weak.
I'd say Hero is first, age really makes a difference in strength, and Hero seems like the type to hit the gym often. Kel feels like a cardio maniac to me
I think the main reason that Aubrey is arguably the strongest is because she can be aggressive whereas Kel and Hero are often very passive to the point that you'd consider them weak. Plus, Aubrey sent Kel flying with a punch, but imo that was just a scene for comedic relief. I firmly believe that Hero and Kel are actually physically the strongest of the circle, whereas Aubrey is solidly in third because Basil and Sunny had their physical health compromised for so long, especially Sunny. Hero and Kel are both similar in height but Kel is noticeably into sports so he might be more athletic than Hero, but Hero is older, apparently knows fisticuffs, and is also strong enough to pull Sunny and Basil out of the lake to save them from drowning which is something you'd usually only see lifeguards do. Imo, I'd place Hero as the strongest among the group.
Ok, that’s a valid point if it’s without weapons! I do think Aubrey has to have at least some strength if she can swing that nail bat, though. But in that case, i’d still put Kel under Hero. Hero can use his fists like it’s nothing
15 year old Hero was, but adult Hero is pretty strong and managed to rescue two teenagers from drowning.
Nah, HERO got noodle arms
Hero’s got that sleeper build
I feel like Hero and Kel would be equal, but Hero would be slightly stronger as 1. he's an adult so he can make slightly better decisions vs a rowdy teenager + Hero has fists in his inventory and 2. Kel mainly uses his basketball as a weapon and I think he'd be significantly weaker without as he probably has never fought with his fists. . Aubrey has more fighting capability but she isn't that physically strong if we're talking blunt force so she stays where she is. . Basil and Sunny would be equal, but I agree in Basil being a little bit stronger.. . So, basically, here's how I'd put it:. . Hero >= Kel > Aubrey > Basil >= Sunny
Aubby beats hero but other than that this is correct
heros gone through puberty isnt it
imo it should be Kel >= Aubry > Hero >> Basil >= Sunny. . even if Hero was physically stronger than Aubry, he's literally  when a spider shows up
Also something i noticed from gameplay clips: whenever someone takes damage, their portrait changes to the first stage of anger with a red filter over it; this applies to everyone *except* for Hero, which I find intriguing. Instead of his anger portrait, it’s his fear portrait instead (still with the red filter iirc).
Maybe it's because Hero's never really seen angry before, I don't think there really is a time where he gets angry outside of that one time with Kel, but that was after Mari's death so it would probably be blocked out, or Sunny never even knew it happened, this could explain how Hero never really looks that angry compared to the rest of the group
It may also be because Hero suppresses/hides his emotions. Out of all of them, he never actually changes when turning angry/sad/happy and variants. Sunny probably looked up at him as the "adult" of the group--he acts like the most composed, but is actually quite vulnerable when alone.
*You should probably Spoiler that*
I think it's because it would make sense for him to make that face than the slightly angry face he has
It’s worth noting that rw hero’s portrait is monochrome when he senses a spider.
That's a really good point about the sad sprites. I hadn't noticed that. Looking at them more now, I notice some other things too. Hero looks to the left when sad and so does Sunny. It's also important to note that real world Kel's (unused) depressed sprite is also looking left. It makes sense that these three would be looking to the left if looking left represents thinking about Mari/Hero's grief over Mari. Aubrey only looks down or straight ahead when sad, which makes sense with how she didn't really think about how everyone else felt over Mari's death.>! What might be the most interesting though is that when Omori is sad, he looks to the right, he looks away from Hero's sorrow, showing that he is very aware that Hero is hurting but is actively trying to ignore it.!<
Its because Heros afraid Image is unique while the Others are Just re-used assets
NO IT IS INTENTIONAL TO PARALLEL HERO TURNING BLACK AND WHITE WHEN HE SEES A SPIDER IRL.
My guess is because >!IRL Hero's afraid face is also monochrome!<
Here is my theory.   . Since that >!Headspace is created and controlled by Sunny/Omori and thus all the characters are based on Sunny's perception of them. In headspace Hero is literally loved by everyone and is considered perfect which shows just how much respect Sunny has for Hero. So when Hero is shown to be scared it's monochrome as a means to symbolize. "Oh shit if Hero is scared then this is serious"!< Again it's just my 2 cents and it's more likely that it's just a cut programming thing
Hero usually hides his emotions so maybe he feels worse when he cant?
now all we need is hero plush then the whole party is here. also Let's Fucking GOOOO. The only character to one-shot all dw bosses
Aight but when's the RW hero body pillow droppin
Hero.
Hero
hero can LEAVE!! 😡😡
Hero
If hero dosent win I’ll be so sad
Hero
>!Hero's more of a ☐☐☐ guy for me, personally.!<
What are the emojis, they just appear as boxes on my phone
Heavy spoilers for alternate route. . >! In blackspace 2 Hero cooks food for you, called just three black boxes!<
(Heavy spoilers). . >!It should be just boxes since I assume it's referring to the blackspace moment!<
Oh ok
The other people who replied are right, they're boxes intentionally as a reference!
They are boxes◼️
Mmm... I love the taste of ballot box ballot box ballot box. 
Hero's not sour enough... he's more of a banana guy. Mild, but very sweet.
No wonder Mari had the eternal banana in the stickers... it's actually Hero condensed into a lesser form.
No hero would taste like a sub sandwich
“Hero tastes like Human Flesh” r/technicallythetruth

Cool pic btw

I'm surprised nobody said Hero would taste like a Hero Sandwich  . (Hero was named after his favourite food, Hero Sandwich. It says so in the pizza place I believe)
Hero would be 100% accurate when it's in real life.
>Hero tastes like human flesh. . Then I'd enjoy eating Hero then

Are we implying that Hero eats human flesh?
I like the idea that Hero Is the only real human out of the group XD
A wise man once said, you are what you eat! I guess that applies to your taste as well if your hero.
Hero is the true god of OMORI, he created all the other characters by baking them and giving them life, thus explaining why he is the only one that actually taste like human
hero is the only human confirmed
So hero is the only normal one here lol
I like how Hero is just the only normal one here.
HERO
hero tastes like mustard
Why is Hero the only normal one?
Good to see someone else recognize Hero is the only real human and the rest are skinwalkers
How do Hero know what Human flesh taste like
No the writing is good but it just ruins Heros character
Isn't that sort of the point? To take a positive character and portray their spiral into a "bad" person? Idk, I guess I understand why people don't enjoy it, but I'm having a blast with the story for now, actually I'd say the writing can be the weaker part of it sometimes
People mostly prefer the fanfics to be close to canon so when the fic is the opposite of the canon storyline people hate it
Pursuit and You are back Mari are the same series so Hero is literally the same
If I remember right, in one of the picnics (the last pyrefly forest one), after she talks abt the lost library and hero asks who told her that, she says something along the lines of "oh, just some shadows here and there, if you focused you could see them too!" so yeah. 
She might be suffering under a societal pressure where she needs to be perfect all the time, due to a side effect of her friends (Aubrey, Kel, Hero, Sunny, Basil) looking up to her as the big sister in the group.. . Hero is too smitten to really be the hard rock for her (he is in young love) and the rest are just young kids who couldnt have known better.. . This is a thing that pesist for a long time...>!Even after she died, her brother still put her up on that pedestal!<
And it Manifests in ways that caused...disagreements
She snuck bugs into Hero’s desk.. . 
Why specifically those 2 could xqc be envious of our hero
[They were also purple.](). . So it was easy to attack them.
The xqc fanbase does not have a hero to look up to. I guess they thought "if we can't have it, no one can!"
Welp, didn't expect much from xqc anyways. Shitty ass streamer
He's one of the guys who screams and breaks his stuff when he dies in Hardcore Minecraft after getting iron
Of course that flippant manchild would have no qualms with unleashing his colossal community of drooling morons onto r/place.. . I’m sick of seeing him everywhere on Twitch too.
Long story short: Hero was a yandere.
Or "hero x (any underage character) is canon"
Like hero x sunny hero x basil to name a fe
"Pursuit Hero is canon."
i would probably shoot myself if she tweeted that
Hero went to college, never came back
set the watermelons on fire!
hero the kinda fella to say whoopsie daisy after making a mistake
Hero is the type of person to apologize when you bump into him
except for hero
Hero sings in the shower
I do that
Hero is the type of guy to go "snore mimimi" in the scrooge outfit while sleeping
Hero the kinda guy that grunts when he gets up.
hero the kinda guy to say humina humina and tug on the collar of his shirt when nervous 
Hero is the kind of person who takes spider extermination too far.
hero is the type of person to ask “what’d you have for lunch?” then cook you a personal five course meal with love as the main ingredient
Hero's the type of guy who messages his girlfriend "I miss you soo much" 5 minutes after seeing her
Hero is the type of person to stick their pinky out and hold a small platter while drinking tea
Hero’s the kinda guy to get a pet tortoise and call it ‘Sheldon’ or ‘Shelby’ . . good timing fr I just saw a different post and put this so
hero the kinda mf to wing every recipe and it always comes out delicious
Hero is the type of person to say ‘ayyy macarena’ at the end of a sad poem.
Hero is the type of person who commits tax fraud and gets away with it
Hero the type of guy to wind up a punch and say "why I oughta!"
hero live reaction
"Im sorry, you're a hero and you have to leave"
Omori: Hero Sandwich. Hollow Knight: Bapanada. Ultrakill: You make even the devil cry!. Halo: Dustin Echoes. Amphibia: I fell down a flight of stairs.. Oneshot: Pancakes. The Owl House: NOW EAT THIS SUCKA!. Doom: Let me help to show you to see slayer.. Faith: Gary Loves You!. There's more but I'd be here all day.
Hero can give birth?????
Wait no thats not what I meant-
This is the future the libs want!!!!. . /s
Pregante???
M-PREG
I think someone took the Hero malewife jokes a little too seriously
I've already seen truly horrible art of Hero by mistake before, I don't need to see that. 
why is hero in the background
Its a new character, watch the video, its similar to the bread twins in a way
*Herocopter
Why is this the first time I genuinely laughed at a pun out loud
"I don't feel so good, Hero..."
Hero pizza...  . I feel extreme jealousy for anyone who doesn't know about it...
I keep hearing about it, can you tell me what it is? can’t find it anywhere LOL
Just... Look up Hero Pizza on google images. You'll regret it.
oh i know now. i know now.
Which image is it ?? I can’t find it
quick 30second search and I'm guessing its [this]() ?
bingo-
Hero is now officially a snack
That is amazing
thanks 😎
What's the deal with hero pizza?
It's an image of mari eating hero but hero is a pizza.
Vore but awesome
I now want the hero pizza shirt
Man, would have totally bought the Hero pizza one
I would bye the pizza hero shirt
that also kinda makes her interest in hero make a lot more sense... 
yeah, as well as how Capt. Spaceboy is her Boyfriend turned Ex/ Husband Turned Ex, which could Symbolise the Love that Hero held for Mari but her Death meant that she effectively "Left" him.. . *this is aided by the fact that Hero resembles Capt. Spaceboy to a frightening degree from the depression after Sweetheart Breaks up with him laying in bed with no desire to do anything, to the explosive rage when the mixtape is played. this could parallel how Kel tried to get Hero to get back to living again by saying that Mari wouldn't want this for him and Hero blowing up at Kel.*. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . **yeah. i thought about this a lot.**
well it's very cool how much thought you put into finding the symbolism in this bc i never realized any of this before today lmao
thanks a lot haha. i'm always worried about stuff like this cause i wonder if i'm thinking about it too much or if i'm making a mountain out of an Ant hill
fair enough haha
OMORI is chock-full of cryptic symbolism so you sort of need to make mountains out of ant hills
yeah thats true
Hero what are you saying
Because she has love for Hero. Surprisingly. That trope is always good.
She is pink!! She is adorable!!! I love her she is my hero
Both Asriel and Hero left for college, so it's possible that Asriel left >!after the death of his partner!<
I wonder if hero and Asriel go to the same  college and talk how they lost >!their first girlfriend in tragic ways!<
My headcanon is that hero is one of those older siblings that never studies for tests but gets the highest grade in the class anyway
Doesn’t Kel say that Hero is naturally good at things, but still tries hard, during his monologue?
During highschool for sure, but in College he seems to be very hard working
College is kind of the slap in the face where you realise you can’t just keep not studying and still get high grades so that’s probably what’s happening  Learned that the hard way
It’s exactly my experience. I crushed tf out of high school with little effort and then had to work my ass off almost the entirety of college until my last semester where the work load/hours was lighter and I was just better in the field.. . I feel for Hero, he had to go through all that (in the medical field no less!) with so much trauma 
Hero burnt out gifted kid arc  Poor boy
This is me but except I don't get good grades
same XD lmao
I feel called out 
no you dont
owned

That’s me:D I’m not as cool and perfect as hero tho I’m so much more lazy
Am I Hero??
i'm not even an older sibling but i do that wtf
Have been summoned?
ADHD MOMENT
So hero is literally just me I guess
He goes to the gym twice a week, even though he hates exercising (we can see during the game that he has low stamina compared to others) . . Misses cooking a lot, even though he hides it, saying he lost interest. . Has given up to try to keep his hair in a non-messy way. It's impossible. (Also, fluffy hair). . Loves sweaters with passion . . Can speak at least 4 languages fluently
i imagine cuz school took up his time is the reasoning he says he doesnt like cooking, deep down i still imagine hes got his inner gordan ramsay
Yeeaaaah
Navy seals probably offering him a career
ah naw don’t let him get more trauma
I don’t know about that language one
It's just a headcanon
Didn't he wear one in Christmas?
Yep
okay but for real tho, hero is UNDERRATED AF- it's a shame
IKR, he is such a cool character!
YES!! I really wish hero was more popular! 
Honestly! I really wish we saw more of him.
I know! Like last year, I think, there was a poll here that asked what everyone's favorite character was and Hero had the least number of votes and by a shockingly large margin compared to the others.. . Let's just say that I was both shocked and appalled...
I feel like hero is the one everybody likes but nobody loves sadly
he’s one of my favorites! he needs more love!
yes!! i need to see hero's face on the Eiffel tower. i need to see him on the statue of liberty i need to see him everywhere i can
Child hero is definitely my favorite of the bunch, but older Kel edges him out
He gives the best hugs. He’s everyone’s older brother figure (which is honestly just canon but shhh)
As someone who is an eldest brother himself, I can vibe with Hero. It's one of the reasons I came around to liking him!
Me too! Except for the fact I’m an only child but nonetheless. Everything else I heavily relate to him
when you get revenge on your friend by being a really helpful and kind father figure to them. . \#justherothings
I can imagine >!that Hero boss-fight but instead of a literal CEO boss, he is just a dad.!<
"Hi, In need of therapy! I'm Dad."
Yeah, Just like that LMAO
Oh my god that reminds me of an old comment I once saw: [(here's the link to it too)](). . >: what's wrong? :Hero fucked Polly! :Come on, Heros not really going to, right? :dude, you okay? Your sweating bullets- :.... :I fucked your mom shitlips
I can actually imagine Hero with Polly post canon, which makes it funnier-
: BITCH. . Hero bursts in. . :WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
That one comic where someone is mad at another for teaching the kid a swear word, except both characters are hero
Ah, I can die in peace knowing that someone else recognized that the fandom forgot about Hero as a individual charachter
i love hero, i headcanon that if he were a real person i would get married to him
bro on god. the only fictional man i wouldnt mind being an irl dude
What? You wouldnt like an irl Batman? It would be kinda dope.
lmao main reason is cuz i dont like dudes but i would go all out for Hero 😤
Relatable
Same tbh
The second biggest chad in the game (after Pluto). I belive that the Hero in Headspace being so charming and liked by literally everyone shows that Sunny really looked up to him, like a male role model. After all, th RW Hero doesn't seem to be or act that way (could be due to depression, but I think the first explanation also makes sense).. . >!I don't think Hero would become mad and "tag" Sunny and Basil (extremely unpopular opinon, I know /s). I always imagine him becoming just speechless after the truth, since he becomes conflicted between what he is feeling about what the two did and what he knows is justifiable (her death being an accident, Sunny and Basil being desperate, etc.), he just wouldn't know how to react. I think he would only forgive them after a few months digesting the information, and in my headcanon he would become friends with the two again after.!<. . >!Also, I haven't seen people talk about it, but the fact that both Hero and Sunny share similar experiences as for their reaction to Mari's death (succumbing to depression and self hatred and isolating themselves) could make Hero understand Sunny better, and thus make them reconcile more easily.!<
I actually never considered that last part. That would make people's headcanon for that more sensible in my eyes in that case. Plus, it'd always be nice to see Sunny and Hero interact some more!
Don’t worry about the opinion of “Hero Tagged Sunny”. I think the same way as you think
Hero my beloved 💕
hero would never even say a swear word
Post true ending, I like to imagine after Hero gets home from final exams, he just treat Kel like a big pillow, and falls asleep on him for the rest fo the day.
canon, especially since Kel had grown a crap ton so its not like Hero would even crush him that much laying on top of him
No thoughts, head empty. . Anyways yea Hero is one of the coolest characters in the game in my opinion. Sure he's not as instrumental to the plot as Kel or Sunny, but when he is there his mere presence sets everything straight. You also get just enough backstory with him to really get to know him in a way you maybe don't see with most of the other characters.
Tbh when i first played Omori i immediately liked Hero, his trope is quite common but I still found myself enjoying his character; though, in general I dont rlly have an Omori favourite, but I can definitely say that Hero caught my attention first
He gets really dopey and giggly when tired, very precious.. Edit: omg why do people like this ty
>!So from what I remember, Hero wanted to be a cook when he was a teenager. He decided on becoming a doctor, after Mari had died. Kind of interesting how the accident influenced lives of every character.!<
he gained his nickname because he likes hero sandwiches
He legit my favorite character and he looks fly as fuck in that suit in the family picture you can find in their house.
>!Nobody knows ir, but he keeps suffering depression. Kel seems to be the only one who knows it, and sometimes worries for him!<. . >!nobody knows about Hero's depression, because he **hides it**, he hides it behind His talent on cooking and His medic studies!<. . >!such hidden depression Is why he wouldn't inmediately forgive Sunny, maybe even would take months on forgiving him. He was Mari's husband, and was uncapable of doing anything for almost a year. It's not that strange that Hero acts a bit selfish with Mari!<. . >!after the truth, Hero doesn't want to know about Sunny for this period of time. Only His brother Kel can help him now, since he's the closest help Hero has to become More reasonable, and overcome His sad thoughts!<. . That's my headcannon. Hero seems to be okay, but he's lying, and he doesn't know for how longer he can keep it
You just said that Hero is the wife, if you didn't notice (true though)
Wait, what!??! Damnit, I didn't notice. . May I edit it?
Sure
when they were younger kel convinced hero to play basketball with him, and every-time hero would let kel win
Favorite character 
Based
I headcanon that Hero gets bad burnout in college — suddenly going from a big fish in a tiny pond to surrounded by other gifted kids and suddenly *average* — and goes a little nuts once he cracks and starts going to parties, but just never tells anyone at home because it’d ruin his image.
He’s one of the most important characters game-play wise
He kinda reminds me of my OC for some reason. And he's the only person who almost made me cry during >!the backstage cutscene.!<
Ummmm how do I do spoilers on Reddit?
>! Put text here. Then do the same on the other side. Idk how to put it without it being marked a spoiler lmao.. . !<
Ah ok
*slams open door at mach speed*. . *switches on megaphone and waits for feedback to stop*. . MY HEADCANON IS THAT HERO IS JUST AS CAPABLE OF FORGIVING SUNNY SOMEDAY AS EVERYONE ELSE IN THE FRIEND GROUP. . Y'ALL ARE JUST EDGELORDS. . *runs out*
Here's the order I'd think the others would forgive the two:. . Kel, Hero, Aubrey. . Hero would definitely take a while, but his empathy would probably lead him to taking it better than Aubrey despite being closer with Mari. Plus, as some other comments said, the fact that Hero already went through a lot of grief, and in a similar way to Sunny in fact, would probably help him empathise with him better too.
My opinion is Hero, Aubrey, Kel
Hero seems like hes bad with technology, I remember somewhere in the game it implied hes good with engineering, but I feel like phones and computers, etc, he would be bad with them
I could see him get overwhelmed with tech, though he'd probably be able to figure it eventually judging by how Kel says that Hero has a natural prowess to anything he puts his mind to.
(controversial) his hair goes forwards
His favorite game is Minecraft
Nah it's cooking mama
He has a world record in Cooking Mama speedrunning
Du du du du
Max verstappen
He strikes me as the type to really like Breath of the Wild
All I can think of when I see Hero is how useless tagging him in HS is. I can’t remember ever using his ability besides during the tag mechanic introduction and Humphrey doesn’t count cause that was all Kel, baby.
I didn’t realize in my first play through, but you can actually get a lot of cool items and charms by interacting with the NPCs with Hero tagged. There’s a lot of little funny quips as well. I started defaulting to Hero being the leader for all the free stuff 
You can also have a discount on the itens of the Mailbox if Hero is the leader
Well that's the first time I heard about that one thanks for telling me about that
I forgot, there's also the lounges and the biker gang in Deeper Well that gives you things if you interact with them as Hero. There's also the lol sword (though not very useful) and the scarecrow in one of the lounges that if you interact with them as Hero, he gains 10 or 20 atk.
He unable to swear all other characters can but hero can't
Hero is the father figure we all need but don't deserve; he's my favorite too!
Chero (definitely ultra-chad)
HERO IS THE BEST. . . I don't have a headcanon, hero is just my favorite
I absolutely love Hero! Ever since I first discovered Omori he has always been my favorite. It honestly is kinda sad that you really don't see very much Hero fanart/ fan content besides HeroMari. He will always be one of my favorite characters and he really is the best Boi. <3 . . Also, for Hero headcanons I'd say that he would be a bit upset at sunny and basil after the good ending but would eventually kinda forgive them and would maybe even finally start to be ok.. . Oh and I imagine that he goes to med school in college and becomes a doctor when he gets older.. And yes even though he loves cooking I think he would mainly keep that as kinda a hobby.. (And maybe he even helps out at like bake sales or something)
His voice is similar to German Garmendia's voice
absolutely Bi.
College is gonna be terrible, considering he canonically hates ramen.
Hes hot
He’s just absolutely packing. Like 12 inches
I guess he is an adult ingame, but... what
Least horny omori fan (sadly)
Hero from the Congo
Hero wanted to be a cook, but after >!Mari died, he felt no real passion for it and instead took the career his parents decided for him.!<. . Hero is naturally charming and is popular with all the girls, though he never pursues them.. . Hero is lenient with Aubrey, because he just wanted to end the fighting, but this comes back to bite him as Aubrey continued doing shit after everything happened. He will however show her the errors of her ways in a more amicable albeit harsher way, so he would tell her angrily that she is wrong for harming others, but he will allow her to change with encouragement. Also he destroys the Nail Bat, yay! . . Hero loves Sally but isn't as overprotective as Kel is.. . Hero would initially be happy with the truth, no longer needing to blame himself for >!Mari's passing. He would be angry with Basil and particularly Sunny, but he would forgive them and not act like a violent Macho like Sunny's dad did when he found out the truth. He is way too forgiving to hate someone over a long period of time, especially if they apologized.!<
Hero is a destroyed boy that put's the others in first place, and honestly he's the one that suffers more
10/10 amazing healer, he’s somehow just like Julieta Madrigal LMAOOOO
True! Blue coloured, protective parental figure!
i want to marry hero. . &#x200B;. . thats my opinion on him
It's not the character quality that sparks discussion, it's controversy. Hero is absolutely non-controversial - no one could ever dislike him so that's why we don't talk about him as much
>!Upon finding out the truth Hero would take a long time to forgive Sunny and would probably be violent and irrational!<
>!👏YES! FINALLY!👏. I've seen so many people say that Hero would quickly forgive Sunny if he confessed, ignoring the fact that Hero loved Mari and became depressed after her death for a while. If he lashed out at Kel for trying to support him during his depression, could you imagine the grief and anger he'd feel knowing his childhood friend and Mari's own brother killed her, and then tried to cover it up as a suicide?!<
No he’d give a big thumbs down 👎
While I disagree, the idea of Hero's only reaction being a thumbs down is hilarious enough for me to accept
[somewhat related ]()
iamveryupset.gif
Cool
henre :)
i believe hero is a simp, not a pimp,
He is 100% wife material.
I am in love with real world hero
Hero isn't bad but he's not nearly as interesting as the other characters. Man did nothing wrong (and I mean that in a literal sense) yet he suffered almost as much as Sunny and Basil
Does hero have black sclera?  or does he have brown sclera?
I really love him!! I wish we got to see more of him. Oh well.
I feel he isn’t really given enough credit for moving the story. I mean, the reconciliation between the friends  were all thanks to him, right? And during two days left (afternoon) and one day left (morning), he was the mvp. I don’t know. I feel he deserves more
I agree!
The game was real quick at getting me to like my crew. I think having the whole team from the start was a very smart way to do this. The first thing Hero made me think about was the Chef in Wanpaku Kokkun No Gourmet World (Famicom game). I honestly geeked out when I got his Chef’s hat in the Hikikomori route because it completed the image for me lol. . . I like the whole crew. Even Basil. He’s proven that he’s a gangsta by doin some shit and not bein a snitch.
He used to own a pog collection
I hate how many people say that Hero >!stays mad at Sunny/Basil over Mari longer just because Mari was his GF.!< It's just lazy. I'm not sure what I headcanon Hero's reaction to be but I just headcanon that it's not THAT.
good bot
That he helps others who are struggling by teaching them, or just people who don’t understand
he gives the best hugs, but he's also a little bony
Hero meditates when he gets too stressed or feels like he's going to need it for a stressful day.
I feel like he plays Cooking fever and other cooking games on his phone when they eventyally become popular. Also He is my favourite character
He sometimes smokes weed but he doesn't want anybody to know about that
He’s bi
Star Trek fan. Hero likes plants but tends to forget about them, so he only keeps succulents.
I can see why you think that, considering his jumper that he wears!
Hero is personally my favorite character. He has been since I first played. He’s like moral compass for the group and I like that he’s very neutral about everything. He is EXTREMELY underrated and really deserves more attention
I love Hero so much, he went through so much and he’s struggling so much, yet still is so kindhearted to everyone, he’s amazing, 100% underrated
Hero is one of my favourite characters for sure in omori and the same goes for my sister. (He is actually her favourite) I have no idea why he doesn't get that much love
Hero is based
Hero is such a selfless person that he has a hard time living for himself.
Hero is a massive star trek fan
I think he's probably either bi or asexual
there is little to Hero outside his relationship with Mari and roll in the group.  It's upsetting how he doesn't get any interactions outside the main group and his mom.  Interactions with Cris and her parents,  Daphne and Bowen,  Bebe's older sister would all make sense and help to develop his character more
He has gray hairs from dealing with the gang post-true ending. . (In the 3 days that Hero comes back from school, he has to save a friend from drowning, one of his friends comes out of the house for the first time in forever, solve a conflict between his friend group, watch two of his friends almost beat each other to death, then learn those two friends caused the death of his gf)
I head canon that he has Asthma.
romantically clueless
hero is trans
my headcanon, that people get mad at me about, is that hero is straight. hes an ally of course. he's just never really had any interactions with anyone to make me think otherwise. he's a huge part of the game, and yet never really shows interest for someone non-woman. idk thats just my headcanon. i also headcanon that he loves books idk why
Hero has a massive schlong
My headcanon is that his name is Hero
Ngl I liked hero cuz his healing is immaculate
Walter white
I like 2 things about him. . . . . . . 1 His brother . . 2 his dead gf
i have only one thing to say here:. . hero #2 best boy
That's cause hero is just the healer In the game my opinion tho
I only recognized Hero as Pursuit Hero after reading The Pursuit Au. That’s all. Those are my thoughts. That and “oh no”.
I head canon his instagram posts are fucking terrible there like really bad quality photos of random bugs and shit
he is best boi
Mobile won't accept the hero's emoji idk why. ,(edited:nvm)

I'M SORRY, HEROSHIMA?
Hero is Batman confirmed!?!?!
. . is he stupid?

Did batman use to have cat ears i forgot
Hero's real name needs to be Bruce now.
We need to make this a inside joke and never explain it 
I love Bruce from Omori.
Hero Sandwich
Isn't his name herobrine???

I don’t think I’m an anime protagonist but if I was I’m definitely dying at the end in some heroic sacrifice.
Then you're definitely not natsuki subaru
That dudes life is just depressing.
They were on a honeymoon
SUS
Susny 😳😳
Can't blame him, who doesn't want to just lay their head on a woman's tummy
Sunny: ¿¡Hero...what...are...you...DOING!?.. . \* later Hero was found buried up to his neck in the sand \*
you have obviously never laid on your girlfriends stomach
Weird flex but ok
Speaking from personal experience it indeed feels great
you tagged hero and mari  . they are no longer in ~~Mira~~ Faraway Town HQ
Like among?
This is just suffering
-.-
Dear lord…. They’re like 15 oh my god
I think it's 16 really, as yes... That's pretty intimate for two 16 year olds
[It's 15,]() [actually]()
No
i don’t get it
Hero got caught LACKING?!
bro hero just like "don't lick DON'T LICK."
Hero has too enjoy it while it lasts
Not again
Certified hero moment
So are you gonna have a hero arc or just exist
Now I'm just gonna be a side character who randomly shows up every now and then.
Cœl
Hero is attractive  (absolutely freezing take i know)
Hero is a cool dude
Hero turned me gay /hj
Hero is the CEO of Outback Steakhouse.
HERO WE GOTTA COOK
Baking bread
I dont think Hero would be angry instead he would be sorry for everything that Sunny and Basil had to go through. . Mari would probably wanted Hero to look after his brother
I think Hero and Aubrey would have some pretty negative feelings about it initially. Kel may or may not react negatively in the moment but would definitely forgive him eventually. But the other two I doubt would immediately feel bad for Sunny because he and Basil pretty much put everyone through hell by hiding the truth, especially the way they did it.. . Yeah, the truth would have hurt anyway but they’ve all now spent 4 years of their lives contemplating if there was something they missed or did wrong that caused this to happen.
What is Hero’s real name?
HeavyFromTF2
He(avyF)ro(mTF2)
avyF mTF2
Well, isn’t his nickname derived from a sandwich?
Henry is supposedly his name… but its still a mystery as its never fully referred to :)

In blackspace 2, you can get ☐☐☐ in the corrupted junkyard, and the description for it is ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ ☐☐☐ ☐☐☐. . Also in blackspace 2, you can get ☐☐ ☐☐ by getting Hero to cook ☐☐☐, and the description is ☐☐ ☐☐☐☐ ☐☐ ☐☐☐☐ ☐☐. . I wonder if the squares in the description are supposed to stand for letters, and if it means anything, or if it's just random
right
Huh, link to this?
. . 
Can you complete heros recipe in black space 2
Yes and it gives you key ingredient if you do
Why's there a door in the Black Docks blocked off by an infinitely regenerating spider web?. . What's the item Black Space Hero gives you?. . What's in the 'you saw something and decided it wasn't for you' door?
Herosaurus
Solution is to vote hero
 HOW ABOUT I CUT YOU A DEAL! I GIVE YOU ONE MILLION CLAMS AND YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP. .  ATTABOY. . Apologies, my inner demons. 
politics really bring out the worst in people
Oh hell yeah hero needs to win
Yep lol, least screentime.
Before I say this, know that I really love all of these remaining characters and this is just me trying to argue against the slighty less interesting ones.. . Hero should be next. His personality as a big bro is charming, but nothing like the other three. Yes, Hero is more tragic than Kel, but Kel is literally the person responsible for the good/true ending. So, back to Hero. He just does not get enough attention as a standalone character, we never really see what he, like, does? He's studying so of course we don't really get to see any of his day, but that's all the more reason to vote him out now. Next will probably be Kel, leaving Sunny and Aubrey, who let's be real, are far more interesting and better written characters than the two brothers, who are still interesting and well written, but none of their character moments made scream.. . But like last time, if you think Hero is the best character, vote whoever you want, none of my business
Yeah i can't do this, nothing personel to hero but it's better than other three, so....im voting hero, who are u voting?
Hero's gotta go, nothing personal.
yeah that's the only solution, i don't hate hero but it's better than voting out the other three
pls let hero live 🥺
I'm sorry but ... **Hero**
Hero I love the other 3 too much 
same
NOOOOOOO. . im voting hero btw
Crap, now who?. . . I'll say hero because he is the least important to the story.
Im not trying to rude and I don't really care for hero either but hes very important to the story.
They aren't saying he's not important, they're saying he's the *least* out of the four remaining.
Oh alr but I still think he's not least important but y'know 🤷‍♀️ that's what I meant to say lol 
Sorry Hero 
Oh well, bye Hero, love ya.
HERO/HENRY FOR THE WIN!
Guys what the hell literally just vote out hero it's an easy choice
I love him but Hero is def the weakest character writing wise of these 4
RW Hero …. EZ
HERO
Hero
Hero
Goodbye, Hero!
Goodbye Hero
We gotta protect Hero 
If he does I'll make sure Hero winsto avenge him
BYE HERO 
Im sorry hero sweetie but its your time (no pun intended)
honestly fuck hero
hero
RW Hero
Kill hero 
HEROOOOO GTFOOOOOO
I’m sorry hero… but your gonna have to go
Sorry Hero.. i have to do it to ya
 GetridofheroGetridofheroGetridofhero GetridofheroGetridofheroGetridofhero
So would Hero.
This would be awesome but in sharksome hall  of previous shark ceos we can see that hero is born in 19XX and in real world we can see a ps1 one or implied to be one so the game real time is around late 90s to early 00s
Yeah ik lol, that's mainly the reason why I put "would" instead of something like "does"
>!Hero did really, but it's pretty stupid lol!<. . >!The most athletic one in the group that is the same height as Hero is right there, and they make the guy known for being unathletic and easily tired go save 2 kids?!<. . >!It does make Hero a pretty good person though, considering at that point he also hadn't seen the 2 in quite some time and they were underwater, so he probably didn't even recognize them at first!<
>!True, but Sunny did dive in first before Hero showed up.!<
Hero gave her a baseball bat for her birthday, and she has a pet rabbit (secretly)
Pretty sure the pet rabbit is canon
Yeah, but she dresses it up when she gets the chance
HERO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It's so joever.
It's because hero was voted out, hero fans and kel fans united, WE SHALL US SUNNY FANS UNITE TOO
NOOOOO HERO 
I can't believe you guys eliminated hero omg....
Hero.
if hero gets out i’m literally never forgiving any of you
I need RW Hero to win 🥺
CAPITALISM WINS, HERO SHALL RISE
DW hero
Hero
hero
Hero must win this
Sunny calls Hero perfect. Does that mean he’s gay for Hero?
Everyobody is gay for Hero
Everyone loves hero according to headspace Basil
Hero especially would be devastated
Hero had less screentime than him.
Dreamworld
He would rather >!kin Jun, because he is also a flower boy and lost a friend due to a tragic incident, got traumatized and is haunted by an evil monster he created, though it was also created by humanity as a whole.!< . . Baufo is also kinda too rough for Basil and would rather mock Aubrey to death, butt heads with Hero, like he does with Katsuya (who is similar to Hero) and try to corrupt Kel with his Grain Joe.
He isn't as handsome as Hero 
I like them both as characters, especially after hero gets back and instantly stops friction by being a reasonable adult, but I can understand not personally liking them
nah capitalist hero is best hero 
Hero better win
Literally the only flawless character who never knowingly hurts other people’s feelings and instantly repairs years long grudges between friends with the power of…. . being a reasonable adult.
Everyone BUT Hero! Jaw-haw-haw!!!
Mwahaha!! Yes! The absolute best character (hero) shall win!t5\31hpy:21602
We shall destroy hero
Gotta love how all of this is going on and meanwhile RW Hero supporters must be happy that they aren't getting any attention at all
RW Hero’s going to stay a few rounds longer and that makes me happy
Put down the cat, let bossman Hero win
They have an alliance they are helping each other
Last I checked on the 6th of June 2023, both the captains of the MEWO clan and Hero Clan came together to form an alliance against Basil. I will uphold my end of the deal. Will you?
Oh shoot I missed that... I revoke what I said... man I feel stupid.
I hope RW Hero wins
Hero.
dream world hero
 Dw Hero is next
Hero
Dream scape hero
Okay, just for that, I'm voting out Hero.
HERO IM GONNA KILL YOU
I love how its all out war here but i just joined this reddit yesterday-. . btw dw hero
No-one do my boy RW Hero dirty .... please?
Hero.... . YOU'RE A DEAD MAN WALKING
Hero is the only one who deserves to win, he's just so nice and reasonable, but he also isn't shallow and has a lot of character details
DW hero goes out. RW hero is just a better version of it
If they're using their rules, that'd mean the Fun Gang can be affected by emotions and thus follow those, higher attack/lower defense when angry, higher crit rate/lower hit rate when happy and sad I guess instead of HP to Juice it'd be HP to TP. Them being sad would be the biggest disadvantage they could be up against as Ralsei needs TP to cast pacify at all.. . And given Omori's refusal to lose, even out of Headspace I feel he'd not like losing, it'd take a lot of pacifying like Jevil to wear him down.. . I also feel that if prep is involved- Omori and friends have far more access to revival items such as Life Jam and Jam Packets than the Fun Gang do to Revivmints. If either side runs out of that, Hero still have Homemade Jam to use.
But again, if we also also using the Fun gang's rules they can also just dodge any attack via the player. I do see what you mean and if we were playing by omori's rules, headspace gang would totally win.
>limited healing items **and Hero***. . Hero is a good support, don’t diss him.
Hero soloes
Actually, looking at the image closer I’m now leaning towards neither. I think it’s gonna be a sequel. because this looks like hero finding out something so this might be a sequel to the game in anime form, especially because the tagline is “next afternoon”. . 
Hero’s future wife
But, she is going to be hero's future wi-. . \*Realization\* ooh\~...
That was subtle
Yes
Hero's wife
A five year old boy who hates heroes, might play an instrument (but probably not), and is an orphan adopted by a bunch of cats.
Hero with long hair
Stairs girl, the best superhero
I want to try out Hero's hairstyle but have no clue how to even attempt that
I managed to pull it off once by accident by falling asleep and waking up with my hair taking some liberties with the frail concept of physics.
Hero looks like scott pilgrim
If they work only in function and I don’t have to actually do the action their title suggests, Cook seems good. I could just literally heal most of anybody’s wounds and possibly even illnesses. Remember, it’s real life. You won’t use many, if at all offensive skills for possibly years. Then again, Hero’s resurrect abiilty could also be could depending if it actually revives the dead or not and the specifics.. . If I had to choose an offensive one, red hands no doubt.
Basil is maybe better person but definitely a better friend than hero. Sunny killed his sister and Basil kept it a secret for him, that's literally the best friend you could have. Hero might be good, but he's way too boring. Especially dream world hero.
HELL NO, BOSSMAN HERO FOR LIFE 
Headspace Hero
BRING HERO DOWNNNNNN
Y'know what, FUCK IT!. . Headspace Hero!
Dw hero, dude is a Mary sue
Headspace hero
Mr electric KILL HIM (and by him I mean hs hero)
Rw hero
God, already from characters we don’t care about to characters we love. Gonna have to vote out dream hero
Real life hero
HS Hero because he’s scared of spiders.
real world hero is also scared of spiders??
But the Headspace versions are worse in general for reasons.
HERO IM SORRY
I believe my least favourite character from this selection would be RW Hero.
Hero
Time for the real fun. . Hs hero
Hero
Hero being labeled a one dimensional character. That goes for most of the main cast tbh.
Although I think hero actually does act the most one dimensional out of everyone, he is far from it. When it’s only him on screen, he actually does seem kinda one dimensional. Being responsible and the big brother of the group seem like that’s all his character is about.. . However, hero’s one dimension-ness is actually done really well. Allow me to explain. . >! When you go to mari’s grave with kel, kel explains how hero coped with sadness, joking himself up in his room refusing to go out or do his work. Then when confronted by kel, hero lashed out in him - a total break of character. After that, his parents come in and he repeatedly apologizes to kel. !<. . He is the most one dimensional character because he literally tries to be that. He stays in character of the mature brother of the group and tries not to show them any other side of him. (He knows he must stay strong for the sake of the whole group). It’s only when he is offscreen and when other characters talk about him that it is revealed there is a whole lot more to hero than one would think. I think that makes hero an even more developed character, as the very fact that hero doesn’t show much weakness or sadness around his friends but in reality is as affected by them shows how he deals with things.
My thoughts exactly! The misinterpretation of his character probably comes from people missing >!the graveyard cutscene!<, which sucks, but there’s nothing that can be done about it 
Yeah that scene is one of the most important to his character imo
Wait how do u spoiler tag on Reddit I wanna comment

A Hero to many but tragically slain at a high age by some teens who weren't able to communicate
Ye old Sprout 🙏
May he rest in peace
i mean... she crushes on hero, so? its not an unreasonable guess at her age?    .     but wait, then the body pillow would be creepy... so she must be 18. but if she's 18, why is she crushing on a 15 year old...?    .     um, let's just forget it and say it's dream logic.
i mean, maybe she just didn't realize hes 15? who knows
: MARRY ME. . : im 15. . : oh shit fr. . : aight then leave
wait is the body pillow explicitly one of her though? its in *her* bedroom and while ultimately she decided to marry herself, its never mentioned how long she's had it
 hero is such a babygirl
agreed
Hero my beloved. 
I always interpreted it as him seeing himself as a black and white person, a monster for what he did in the real world and tries to make himself a hero in his head which is why he would make enemies to triumph over in the first place
Brooo same it was so time consuming. Thank god for Hero’s reviving ability 
I kept spamming Cook
Cook and homemade jam
I did all of this grinding to get out, made the mistake of leaving to heal without wasting items just to then walk back in to "finish off the last bears and collect the watermelons"
Wait, what's homemade jam?
One of heros skills it's just like regular life jam I'm pretty sure
I must've not noticed it when I was playing. That sounds pretty useful honestly!
why did i misread cook as cock
Jesse
What Mista White I Need to defeat the rare bears
I remember using Hero's massage skill while having everyone else attack, or if you pause fast enough you can heal everyone and then go back to battling, 
i beat them all in one try (saying this as a terrible gamer), just take advantage of Heros cooking skills and use up all that food
>!Actually 16, almost 17. Mari died 4 years before the current events of the game and she died on October and the game probably takes place either late May or early June since that’s the time college kids finish and come back home so it probably hasn’t been a full 5 years. Making Kel and Basil 17, Aubrey either 16 or 17 and Hero 20. Also it’s been mentioned that Hero’s been in college for 2 years both in the manga and game (the manga introduction recap and when Hero says his parents made the same thing last year when he came back from college. It was never mentioned he start college early so he’s most likely 20 in the events of the game. Yeah, I’ve done my research.!<
damn I need to play the game again
I believe the real world segments of the game take place in the summer of 2000, and >!the incident took place in October of 1996. It lines up with "3 years, maybe 4" and mentioned by Aubrick. So he'd be about 15 almost 16!<
Hero is said to have been 15 in 19XX, though. And by 2002, the Gameboy that seems to be shown in the photo would've been discontinued by a few years.
As mentioned, not and mentioned*
I mean, there’s often breaks in the fall and early winter as well, meaning that Hero could’ve still been a >!college freshman!<…
>!It’s been mentioned twice that he’s been in college for 2 years, he just finished his second year.!<
I was only responding to what you said about Hero’s parents >!making the same thing as last year!<

I got Hero and Sunny and Hero’s shirt for Christmas!. . Merry Xmas Omori friends!!!
nice, link me the shirt
My brother got them at Comic Con but I’ll link em!. . . Omori’s shirt:. . . . Hero’s Shirt:. . . . Edit: clearly OMO sells them on her site, but the OMORI shirt (the face/mask) has been sold out for a while… somehow my brother got both of these at ComicCon NY. I guess they had extra stock for DA CONS
thx, sad they're sold out
Sad emotion helps a lot to reduce damage if you have the time to spare.  Took me 30-40 minutes to clear the room but I didn’t have to use items with Hero restores.
Hero’s Massage skill can actually make an enemy neutral iirc
Dont. This is really helpful for level up and harder bosses. Fight all of them. If you needed food press escape and in the meanwhile they have stopped make hero cook to heal others
Heal when you get a break using heros healing abilities rather than food
 hero already told me
 Hero that's enough coffee for the day
Guys I'm literally just putting on cat ears. Don't make a fuss.

 What are you gonna do about it?

 Stop
 wtf did I miss?
Wait, wasn't it said somewhere that hero's actual name was  henry?
In-game Hero = FNAF Henry. . Pursuit Hero = DSAF Henry
I bet Hero recommended him to play that game
Any otome games. . Why tho she got Hero
No she uses them to find new flustering tactics.
You know what i canon this rn

He had a crush on her, probably would be the opposite
: Don't you dare date Hero while I'm still sleeping in the same room as, living in the same house, and eating the same food as you!
: Uh, guys? I think she really won't be dating Hero anymore. . : (Died from a heart attack) (No really, they are playing a prank on them too) (you can't outprank , Sunny)

Well, I don't think you guys understand it because you're so young but anyway, we're working on something... I don't know what it is but supposedly it's something to extend life, my friends think they could cure cancer with this... or end up causing the zombie apocalypse according to the pranksters in my group
A blue funny robot killed Hero infront of them, and this initial reaction is suppressed by denial. Soon they will learn the fate to come to them. Soon fear will really set in, as they get thrown into the fire...
Blue funny robot?... ... ... hold up a second.. . &#x200B;. . Is this an Ultrakill reference?
I have 86 hours into the game please help me
Nah man, also maybe one day i will play that game... if my laptop can handle of course xd
If you're laptop can't run the game how is it even working that game takes up nothing.
Well this laptop can run TF2 (of course with steam), also i have some games in my emulators(includ PS2 and Gamecube) that runs good so yeah i will download that game and see what happens.
good luck
Thanks

AU where >!they all helped hang her, and Hero is the only one who doesn't know the truth!<

I need a fan fix of this immediately.
it was part of his character arc, every hero needs a dark past
god i love this subreddit
Omori or Hero there faces are cute design.
Hero 🔛🔝
Hero because I barely see anyone mentioning him here, he's absolutely handsome in plush form. I mean look at that smile! 
Hero and Omori, since they look the most accurate in my eyes. I would snuggle any/all of them, though.
hero looks very cute and innocent
hero (he is the only one not looking at me with murderous intent)
And Hero
me w/ hero
he’s real nice, he was considering giving hero a like 1 clam per month salary
I mean thats not bad for a kid 
Average child labor supporter:
Hero in Headspace is 16, he could get a legitimate job
I will always be a random Hero fan.
Hero (both dream and irl)
I haven’t finished the game but so far I love Hero. Hopefully he’s not a terrible person
Oh are you in for a big surprise.
I don’t know if I should be scared or not
I’m just fucking with you he’s pretty cool.
Thank goodness, I didn’t want the chill baking guy to be the reason someone died or something
Hero, makes me happy! Plus he can cook

Sans is hero confirmed!?!?!??
Yeah lmao, I mean they could have replied with the follow up dialogue, idk. . It's nice to see another feller who enjoys both The Last of Us AND Omori. Based person and average Hero tag W 
I tip my hat to you pardner, I hope you have a fantastic day 
Same to you mister 
Answering to you, yes its canon. . Hero's name can be found in the game files, and it is in fact Henry (I think that thanks to him liking HEro sandwiches and being named HEnry it was easier for the gang to call him Hero lol). . Kelsey can be found on some old trailers and especially promotional images. . OMOCAT herself once tweeted Aubrey's full name, Aubergine. Similar to Kel, the gang probably just abbreviates her name to Aubrey. . Hope this helps buddy 
Who the fuck would name their child Aubergine
mfs in the 1800s
I think you kinda are headcanoning and protecting. We never know what exactly he said to Hero. Maybe he was being genuinely understanding, careful and nice and Hero just attacked him out of frustration. Plus even if he did it on accident, it's not enough for him to "Have to block out most of it due to how hurtful it was, but still retain the worst parts". When he said that, I felt more terrified that I was in any of the game jumpscares. We always had Hero as this goodie two shoes (I think that was the expression) that did nothing wrong, then we learn he did that to his own little brother? They made peace, yeah, but that left him f scarred for life, a literal trauma . . And about him hurting people... If you are talking about him not being there for Aubrey: We gotta remember his brother was in his way to become a Hikikomori himself. Plus he didn't feel like he could fill in Mari's role, something he does in RW when he gets the chance after 4 years. Not only he had the responsibility of bringing everyone back together, he had to take care of his big brother and even find time to cope himself. He even realizes he did bad, but he couldn't do everything by himself. We had 2 shut ins, 2 emotionally scarred friends and Kel who was devastated himself, and he was the only one "good" and "strong" enough to try and bring everyone together again, and he failed
Stable but his mom is a bitch. As someone who is a people pleaser, Hero's mom is to blame
I've seen a dude named Awesome. Anything is possible if the parents are uncreative enough. Or creative. Depends.
That's fair there's a kid at my school named Ontario. We live in Ontario. It's wild
Anything is possible if the parents are American enough.
There's a kid at my school who's name is the same street our school is located on.
how was he called by people?
No idea, he's like 10 years old and I've only met him once. I'd have to ask his sister.
I'm fairly sure the name "Henry" is only in the game files of demos, and not the 2020 full release, but it's still the closest to a canon name Hero has.
Does anyone remember the war of Henry VS Hero?
yeah and hero’s is henry lmaoo
I just kept lowering their attack, making everyone happy, and using counter with Aubry while healing her with hero every turn, granted I had tons of juice snacks but it worked pretty well for me, 1 turn on set up, they can't really threaten anything afterwards
I did this just make sure you have hero’s revive equipped
Especially their attacks and outfits in head space. Like hero is literally nothing but the cooking dude lmao
Yeah, I always go to attack with one of his specials and then go "oh, right. He doesn't do that."
The charming cooking dude!
You can get clams in return? It's always the same amount or it goes down if you tagged Hero for lower prices?
You can tag hero for lower prices? GOD DAMN IT I WASTED SO MANY CLAMS
Hero should probably do something then if you know what I mean. 
 Wh-

its not fair why does she get hero and not me
>!She's sorta perfect but like Hero that comes at a cost But I don't fully blame her do you feel the fact that her image has been glorified after her death. !<
r/foundhero
Well that’s kind of the issue with having a dead character. You can’t play around with their character unless it’s explicitly stated by someone else and with such an unreliable narrator like Omori and only outside sources with obvious biases (Hero and the gang) it’s not very easy to determine what’s true and what’s false
With Hero, it's the best.. . >!ăąãâāáàâäaª!<
Good:The perfect sister,also the perfect wife (for Hero)and friend.. Bad:a little bit perfectionist,but nothing more
They were definitely upper middle class. Hero commented on how they always had the "latest toys", piano and violin lessons etc.
huge plot hole: why are Hero's hamster summoning abilities never brought up again?
I think that Hero calling friends was supposed to be his original ability instead of his charm, so I think this is just a holdover of that.
Makes sense. They can rewrite a lot of scenarios involving the headspace citizens but he can’t rizz up a giant cheese wheel.
mouse sounds (with rizz)
AFAIK it is actually true
Hero certainly charmed me. But my heart belongs to Basil and Aubrey.
unbravo vince
It’s a reference to his early ability to summon friends
What’s even better is that this area is used to teach each characters tag ability that you will be using throughout the game, yet hero’s hamster summoning skills are never brought up again
Hero:  Hello. Conveyor belt: 😊😳
top 10 greatest mysteries that are still unanswered
I mean it's just a dream so this shit is pretty normal in a dream lol
Nothing that happened in omori is normal to my dreams… I have no magical fun world in my head…
Black space is the only place I have in my dreams
You can meet her at Otherworld's Club Sandwich
SHE STOLE MY CCHESE WEHEEL
hehehe
She a little hungie, maybe a little silly even
Yeah its silly!1! Even though its not in the main story, in those little clubs you can see her sometimes and she’ll steal a cheese wheel from your pocket, and in the secret dev room there’s a grave for Ems too !1!1 Its probably an inside joke  about someone on the Dev Team :]
Ems is the lead pixel art designer for omori, both the grave and hamster are named after them ^^
Ah that makes sense how fun !!1! 
Secret Dev room?
Yes its a secret area in blackspace. If you go to the town area with all the graves at the top and click in a bunch of the graves, eventually one will take you to the graveyard where there is a grave for each member of the dev team 
 Bro really said “Hol up, I know someone” 💀
That someone: 🐭
Bros js him
I thought ems was going to be a recurring ally that'll appear  again througout the game, then i gradually forgot about that, until i complete the game twice and realized ems never appeared again and was just a one-off gag of some kind
Ems is THE character.

"ay lemme dial someone rq"
silly hero things 
hampter
That part was so confusing for me
I guess anything do be possible in le dream world
It just happened to me because i decided to replay the game.
EMS... Kinda sounds like Emergency Medical Services.
Emergency mouse services (Except she's a hamster so ig it doesn't work)
It’s just short for Emily, one of the pixel artist for the game
I think I repressed some memories
this had to be the most random thing in the game 😭
(hero is an adult)
OK I just wanted to fully explain my view point from my previous comment, =I do not  'ship' these two fictional characters. My orignal comment was me thanking someone explaining that a fictionnal character comes in contact with another character (which is 18+ years old) do not and the idea //should not// be used in any way.
Don't anybody fucking make a hero ship reference or else you are going to be toast
Yeah that's gross, don't do that.
What about Hero x Mari? 🥺
that's fine since they are both of age.
And it's canon
>!was*!<
Whaddyou mean >!was I'm pretty sure Mari was the only girlfriend hero ever had.!<. . Edit: oh wait I get it
Yeah, she >!was. That understandably wasn't sustainable after she died.!<
Yeah I get it now
Necrophilla
[NO!]()
[got another one]()
Ah. There it is
It is..acceptable
Omri x stea k
Aren't they only like, 3 years apart? (Please correct me if I'm wrong)
Question, can we throw the toast in a blender?
Technically you can throw anything in a blender.
Hebby
​
It's because Hero is the one friend she cannot look down on, she feels smol
I think she's embarrassed cause hero is taller then her, and she's supposed to be the tough strong delinquent girl and hero is all friendly with her, cause I don't thing that this shit would be on steam if that was a romantic blushing
That makes sense, I also don't think it's supposed to be romantic either, cause that would be gross and illegal cause hero is like 19 while Aubrey is 16.
I don't think it's creepy or at all unusual for a 16 yr old to find a 19 yr old attractive and simply blush from such an interaction.. . Would be creepy the other way around obviously.
I don't necessarily think Aubrey is into Hero still though, given their relationship.
Oh, I definitely agree with that.  I was just giving my opinion on the broader context.
If you don’t blush around HERO, you probably have less emotion than a rock
Hero x among us
Completely unrelated but Hero is so cute oh my god <3
Just her "tough" girl face being unmasked.. . She isn't blushing because of Hero. That would be an disgusting ship tho
Idk why people creep out. Like, she might have small crush on Hero or find him attractive, it doesnt mean it will be mutual or that her feelings wont change. And op, u are right. I ship Kel x Aubrey, Mari x Hero though.
Hero, because I simp for him.
&#x200B;. . 
The only answer.
Yeah…
Real
Nobody mentioning Hero and his overbearing mom 😳
*Hero simp apears in Polish*
I mean... other Fandoms have been a lot worse. Unless I've missed something, no one here is refusing to take their schizophrenia medication to chat with Hero like the Bocchi the Rock Fandom, so I'd say we're doing okay
What happened ????? In the bocchi the rock fandom????? 😭
The 7th would be Heroic Buns
\#notallheroeswearcapes
let's be honest, hero would probably still be hero
hero and the random hero fans
Random Hero fans
When My sister said, Hey handsome face, to Hero. . 
When real world hero saw a spider 
in the treehouse when aubery suddenly ran past hero. the sound and quick movement scared me so much
r/FoundTheHeroFromOmori would probably work work?
r/21characterlimit
Oh wow, didn't realise i made exactly 21 character limit name
You can't hide from us Hero
Fuck i got caught
Probably Hero showing up when finishing *someone's* chores.
*HERO used SPATULA*
*BASIL used ROPE on HERO*
Hero has a canon name though doesnt he? i might remember wrong but i think hero was his nickname or smth
oh wait im stupid you literally said it in your comment im so sorry
My husband is Hero White, yo
Uhuh? (Rock vine boom)
He told me everything. 
Seriously? 
Last chance to look at me Hero

Chicanery is leaking
Hero OMORI
ManlyBadassHero, I was a big fan of his gameplay content
I watched his playthrough as I did not have a PC at the time and iirc despite being released quite quickly (the first playthrough of its kind I believe?) it is very detailed and Manly only missed very obscure secrets
Yeah, watched Manly's playthrough and it was such an experience. However he didn't film the hikikomori route so I had to watch an omori route playthrough via another YTuber.
I’ve gotten tons of my recommendations from ManlyBadassHero. I love watching his play through after mine and seeing how he guesses major plot points hours before they happen since he’s played so many horror games and rpgs. He’s also really good at analyzing them.
based
I second this manly is a chad
I'm so glad I chanced upon him, knew a lot more RPG maker games thanks to him 
Hell yeah.
Ye he's a really good youtuber
Whatched Manly’s pkaythrough of it and it was so good it persuaded me to buy the game myself on my old PC.
Manly Badass Hero
I saw manlybadasshero’s gameplay of it and quickly fell in love with the game. You wouldn’t believe how ecstatic I was when a switch release was announced and I finally got to play it for myself after 2 years of waiting.
Was already kind of in the indie RPGMaker game scene and I started being recommended YouTube videos about the game. Eventually caved in and watched ManlyBadassHero's playthrough
I searched for game play on rpg horror games one day and found this video by manlybadasshero on this game called omori, at first I wasn't impressed and found the video and the game boring because at first I assumed it was just another kids game, but some time passed and I got really bored so I decided to give the video another shot, and boy was past me so wrong the game was much much more than that and I immediately became hooked with Omori quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time story wise.
Manlybadasshero, his let's play is pretty alright and he is one of the very few people who shut the f up at the ending.
Saw a 4 hour video by ManlybadassHero pop up in my recommended
I saw a video on my YouTube recommended about a deep analysis.. . At first I thought that the story was that Omori was in the friend group, with Kel, Aubrey and Hero but everyone preferred Hero over him so he was always ignored
Manlybadasshero
Manlybadasshero, banger content, tbh.. Tho I feel as if an influx will happen soon because Jaiden animations played the game last night.
ManlyBadassHero introduced me to OMORI
Manlybadasshero i remember in lockdown getting back from high school and watching his playthrough
Like most games, ManlyBadassHero
I believe he didn't have the 20 for hero's book but he had some pocket cash and was able to afford the candy
Till this day, I can't discern whether mine was Hero Sandwich flavored or Toliet Ramen flavoured
Hero is about to become the HAMMER OF JUSTICE!
The pan of justice!
Hero, Cooking Mama, Rapunzel and I: YEEEEEAAAAAAHHHH!!!! FRYING PANS!!!!. . . (I do not know how to spell Rapunzel and it’s midnight)
Oh, okay.. . 
"Did you ever hear that old suite? Yes, based upon the prophecy. Lord of the Violin.". . "I. The Secret of the Flower Prince. After an ordeal, the heroes witness a darkness take over a humble prince.". . "II. The Cosmic Seas. The heroes help a saddened hero of the stars.". . "III. The Ruthless Princess. The heroes halts the wedding of a wicked ruler of an underground colony.". . "IV. The Trials of the Aquatic Domain. A piano player helps out one of the heroes in their time of monopoly and experiments.". . "V. The Field of Red and Darkness. What happens next? Hehe...who knows! There was only one more part of the suite after that, but it all stopped. The suite became so sprawling, so technical, so long.". . "Some say it swallowed up the composer herself."
HERO would become the Pan of Justice
Hero would grind cooking mama
I WAS LITERALLY THINKING THE SAME THING OMG
lol true
Compilation of other comments and some of my own. . Hero friends cooking mama. . Mari plays animal crossing with hero. . Basil DEFINATELY plays Plants vs Zombies, and probably stardew valley . . If omori's dream headspace has rpg fighting, I assume he likes rpgs, so I'd say he probably likes something like Sea Of Stars. . Aubrey might play something like pokemon, and obviously WII sports (she will only pick baseball) but I also think she might like something like hollow knight (nothing other comments gave to snuuy) . . Kel plays Minecraft
I don't think the fights are actually like RPGs in the story and it's just how it looks in gameplay. Real world battles play as RPGs too.
Hero would play cooking mama, every cooking mama.. . Off topic: this image gives me ptsd
* Kel would 100% play Minecraft (and Among Us),. * Basil would love Stardew Valley and cute games like Hoa, Spiritfarer, and Toem,. * I think Aubrey would enjoy Cult of the Lamb and Animal Crossing,. * I don't see Hero as a huge gamer, but I think he would play co-op games with the others (especially simulators like Overcooked) and he would play all the Cooking Mama games lol -- he also might like A Little to the Left and Venba, . * Mari would like the Life is Strange franchise, Gris, Fields of Mistria, and she *would* make Hero play It Takes Two with her . * Sunny would play Little Nightmares, Oxenfree, Night in the Woods, and maybe point-and-click escape room type games
SPIRITFARER MENTION???
Hero would absolutely play the Papa's games and speedrun 100% on each one everyday.
Hero would play Dress to Impress 100%
AND YK HE'D BE GOOD AT IT TOO
Hero would play Cooking Mama ! You know what, this is my new headcanon now
lmaooo
Hero: probably a big Nintendo fan. The game directly says he isn’t a fan of violent or mature games. I’m thinking things like Zelda, Kirby, stuff like that.. . Mari: idk why I just get the feeling she’d be a fan of horror games. I feel like she’d enjoy classic Resident Evil, Silent Hill, stuff like that. I also think she’d play things like Animal Crossing to keep Hero company.. . Sunny: Getting indie vibes from him. The kind of person to go on Steam and put a bunch of games on his wishlist then buy some and play like 1 of them. He’s more partial to RPGs based on the way headspace works. But he’s actively searching for that 5 hour long game that’ll just change his life. Probably a big fan of Undertale and Yume Nikki. Also might be an Atlus fan. Also enjoys Nintendo and PlayStation stuff a bit. Would Pirate pokemon games to relive his childhood. Also thinking he’s a big rhythm game fan.
Hero would probably be that one guy who hops on cod once every month but doesn't use mic. Mari would play Minecraft with hero. Basil would play animal crossing. Sunny would probably be asleep. Aubrey would play postal.
I think hero would enjoy horror games
Hero occasionally dips his toes into the world of candy crush idk
Hero obviously plays cooking mama
happy birthday omor :). . 
>!I wonder why...!<
Hero asking the same questions as everyone: "who done fucking gave Omor those legs"
honestly dream body right there. . Really dream fit. . The thigh highs are important ok
THEY AREN'T JUST REALLY LONG SOCKS?!. . 
I don’t remember them being that long lol. . 

the trans thoughts took over. . . I'd say I'm sorry but I know damn well I'm not
the trans thoughts are so real for that 
I can't stress this enough like bro is giving transfems (me) gender envy like HOW
I deadass thought the exact same thing im not even kidding 
yeahhh
Omori is femboy certified
Dream fit lmfao
Hero can't afford to be excited because he's gotta study for his three AP exams.
Who done gave him the femboy socks
He has them in the game.
The black keys have letters N, S, U, N, Y as well as 4, 1, and 3.. . Hmm... I wonder what it is...
Omori's zesty ahhh legs though  /j
. . /j
Am i the only one who finds it weird he isn’t holding the horn normally? Like you do the horn on your mouth or if it’s a party popper you hold it high.
They gave bro thigh highs...
He always had them. Why are people suddently weirded out by it?
WHY IS BRO SO ZESTY
The little omori stickers should be Canon . Like, you find mini versions on their own little adventure

H E  K N O W S
Hero probably had to set everything up 
Happy bday Omor 
Why is omori wearing stockings
Object show fan spotted in the wild
It's really cute aww!
I look like omori on my birthday
Why did they draw Omori like a femboy
Nah he looks lobotomized
. . A real fan alright.. yikes
Wait omg it’s my birthday todayyy
Why is Omori so zesty though 😭. Like, what disturbs me is that he looks more childish than the game's design, but also more "sexualized"... Not only those socks, but his gaze is definitely too flirty, it's difficult not to think it was made on purpose.Idk I'm a bit worried about the direction this is taking
genuine question, but how does he look sexualized and flirty????? i can't see it at all??? also those are just normal socks????
I know, right?? I literally do not see it, even after people have pointed it out. I wear long socks all the time just because they’re comfortable, and I’m also a minor. Long socks do not have to be sexual.
exactly! i hate how oversexualization of everyday items/clothing can 'ruin' art pieces like this in the eyes of others. it's literally just socks  also i draw the exact same pose all the time as an artist (mostly cause i have no other ideas lmao), nothing about the pose is created to be 'alluring' or things like that. no offense to others in this reply section, but it really feels like an overexaggeration.
Maybe I'm wrong and just exaggerating and if so, better.
>Not only those socks, but his gaze is definitely too flirty, it's difficult not to think it was made on purpose. . You're the only one complaining about it.  Why is it the artist's fault that you felt this way when you saw the picture?. . After all, fantasies are one thing and reality is another.  So when you view this work think whatever you want, it's between you and yourself alone; in reality, I suggest you do nothing. For the most part fantasies do not reflect actual desire.  Maybe you should think about what it represents to you, in your mind, psychologically speaking. Or it could be that you just liked it and can't do anything about it, no need to overthink it.
Hero misses her too. Maybe he had the same audio hallucination.
Poor Hero
Ok, here is a point. What if Hero is a hallucination too? He immediately teleports upstairs. Of course he could be really fast and athletic, but it's my personal belief he is also a hallucination in this scene
I think so too. There are so many new people coming into the fandom and it always happens with big fandoms that they get bad (Undertale, My little Pony, etc.). Also there's the canon Hero fanon Hero drift, which is pretty similar to the canon Sans/Papyrus fanon Sans/Papyrus thing. I just mean, canon Hero: . . . - Sunny I forgive you, but I will need some time to get over everything . . Fanon Hero: . . - SUNNY YOU MURDERER!!!! YOU KILLED MARI!!!!!!! I WILL HATE YOU FOREVER YOU ARE A MONSTER AND A GENOCIDER AND YOU ARE ROTTEN INSIDE YOU SHOULD JUST DIE !!!
This is why the only one I’d indulge is/was Hero-Mari as it’s hinted Hero May have had feelings and wasn’t unrealistic, most of the others after the 3 years don’t seem realistic or healthy, least not without a time jump, and even then dating outside of the cast and having a life away from the others seems as likely
This is the only ship I approve of
I agree, ships aren't inherently sexual just like relationships aren't inherently sexual. The problem is when people (like me) create jokes such as the [Two Hero's Theory]() and go a little too far with it   . It happens to the best of us 😞
Alright this isn’t even funny it’s just downright creepy
No its disgusting
Omori fans when you tell them their “harmless joke” about a 19 year old having sex with a 16 year old who hasn’t had the chance to mentally develop properly since he was 12 is revolting 
WAIT SHIT I THOUGHT IT WAS HERO TAKING CARE OF SUNNY. . ;-;

No it’s downright creepy! . . (/s)
Well that too. . yeah
its true that jokes like these arent rlly funny but chill out bud i dont think they had any bad intentions it was prolly just mocking a side of the community, or maybe im just seeing the good in them
“Like me” .. “And go a little too far with it” .. I dunno. Sounds kinda sus
Some people can't appreciate the subtle humour of Two Hero's Theory 
Okay you are actually really annoying, please shut up and stop commenting the shitty theory you creepy weirdo.
LOL [make me]() 
where do you find the humour in this its just weird
Well, it's not actually weird. The age of consent for the majority of the world is 16 years old, so by that logic you're the weird one by thinking that.  . The humour of the joke is that the premise and choices are so ridiculous that it would never happen. If you've never laughed at the [Two Buttons Meme]() before, then you'll probably never understand the joke.
>The age of consent for the majority of the world is 16 years old, so by that logic you're the weird one by thinking that.. . it shouldnt be
Okay, well go out and protest about it if you feel that strongly. See how many people honestly care.   . Unless you're protesting on twitter you'll find most people don't get their panties  in a knot over someone dating within 3 deviations of their age.
its not about the age range its about the age itself
again, go out and protest to make your point heard. If you honestly think it's immoral for the age of consent to be 16 then start a movement in real life. Get things changed to your own morals. Don't blame me for abiding by the rules that everyone else agrees with.
my brother in christ i get the joke its just not funny
Okay, but you asked where the humour was and I told u lol
fair enough actually
Did I just spoiled endgame stuff or if just funny doodle goes vrooom
Leave this subreddit. Come back when you finish the game to avoid heavy spoilers in literally every comment section.
F
I fucking hate that I get that reference

Well I don't know in which year were they Born, but all I know Is DW Hero is about 15 y'o'
Everyone except hero and Mari are 12 before >!the incident!<. . Mari and hero are 15

Bro what??? In headspace Mari is 15 so is hero, everyone else is twelve, . . In faraway town (trying my best not to spoil) sunny is 16 and so is the rest of the the cast except hero who is 19.
So… everyone Is 36 except Hero who Is 39?
Yeah I think so
Herosaurus
Hero
Hero
Hero/Henry, he's underrated.
Hero tends to be under cosplayed as far as I’ve seen
hero is swimming in shit 
... 
Coom😳
Then what is Omori swimming in? 
Cumori
welcome to cum space
You've been horny for as long as you can remember
This would be the dialogue if we got an Omori boy DLC lol
ITS CALLED AN OMUSSY
The plot of the DLC could be Omori overcoming his Lust for sex
NO
OMOR ARMY ATTACK!!!!!

😳😨
I think Omoriboy made it. Not sure what it is tho...
He swimming in MALK
The tissues in white space are there for more than just wiping away tears 
Hell nah someone get Hero outta dat shit
Hero because Choccy milk
I like color blue and chocolate so i'd go  for Hero but they all are good so CHOOSE ALL OFF THEM
Ooo that's cool, I would personally get hero. He just looks so comfy hah! 
They’re all great. Id personally choose hero because it’s hero. Good luck with choosing lol
Hero is choccy milk
The only one who actually seems decent irl would be hero
Hero is the real hero
Hero. Not that Hero is a bad person, as a matter a fact they are totally normal and I love hero. But man would that be a boring conversation to have. I feel like in a group Hero is great, but one on one Convo with hero wouldn't be too fun.
would still marry him
I have an interesting take, I think I would hate Hero in real life BECAUSE he's so perfect. As much as I love him in the game, I would just feel worthless each time I'm near him. In the end, I just think I would avoid him...
Okay maybe i was wrong that you definitely have pink space and eternal banana comments definitely going for you but that doesn't really change the fact that your most active comments are mostly about Bubbly, there are more comments about your Bubbly thing, there are more members that are willing to engage with you more on Bubbly rather than your comments, you even admitted yourself that your comments got multiple downvotes which means people are paying attention to your comments.. . Also not to be a grammar nazi but. . Also Upvotes and Downvotes are both "Attention" the definition of an Attention is literally simple notice taken of someone or something; the regarding of someone or something as interesting or important, to use more "smarter" words, it means that people are more aware of your actions.. . I could get thousands of downvotes for saying "Hero is a bad character." that is called an attention, both downvotes and upvotes are both under the definition of attention. . . Also when people say about proshippers it also doesn't mean you should specifically mention Bubbly, it seems like the definition of proshippers to you became Bubbly. Just say "some users here are sadly proshippers." Even if you didn't start it just say that some users here are proshippers. . . I'm not saying again that you do look bad or anything, all i am saying is that you are looking pretty obsessive even if that's not your intention.
>your most active comments are mostly about Bubbly, there are more comments about your Bubbly thing, there are more members that are willing to engage with you more on Bubbly rather than your comments, you even admitted yourself that your comments got multiple downvotes which means people are paying attention to your comments. . I already proved all of that wrong, bro what??? They aren't my most active comments. I provided links that prove this. . . . More engagement on my Bubbly comments is also false. My "Eternal Banana" comment has more engagement in general, with multiple unique commentors. My comments revolving around Bubbly however, feature mostly the same 3 or 4 users (if that), and those 3 or 4 people are the same people downvoting my comments and upvoting each others. Receiving 1 or 2 downvotes on my comments involving Bubbly is not more engagement than my other comments receiving hundreds of upvotes with only 3 replies. That's just not how it works. You're grasping at straws to make me look obsessed, and it's not working.. . . Again, you sound more upset at the fact I'm exposing Bubbly as a proshipper that sexualizes children than the fact I come across as "obsessed". Get your priorities straight
Okay you know what, you're definitely right. You're definitely right on everything. Have a nice day
💀 sure bro
🍿 I freakin love drama
Bro that wasn't even good drama, that was just sad 💀. . . Dude is on that schizo grindset
🍿
I love destroying proshippers in arguments for other people's entertainment 
"No big YouTubers have played". . Manly badass hero, 8-bit Ryan did 1 ep.. . The popularity of a game also doesn't determine its worth. But 2 examples right there.
Yeah, i thought games that were under the radar by big let's player were considered to be hidden gems, just like how great Lisa The painful is despite not being popular, and didn't Mori Callioppe played it?
Also Bijuu Mike and Merg.
Merg, Biju Mike and Manly Badass Hero are crying in the corner(3 big youtubers who played omori)
Nice to see manly getting more attention, dude is great.
Wow where can i get these when they release. Need Hero hes my Hero
HERO
I mean, Pluto describes himself as a "Rogue Planet," which is an actual term for a planet that doesn't have a Solar System, but is still a planet, so in any case that would mean Headspace "happens" *before* 2006. . Also, the technology + Hero's photograph after his boss battle imply it happens in the 90s (it says Hero was president in 199x or 19xx idr, but it's not that big of a change). . So yeah, we know almost for sure that it happens as early as 1990 and as late as 1999, with the Real World sections being then 1994-2003. . My headcanon is a bit later, around 2004-05, since the older technology could be excused as Faraway being a small town and Sunny could only think of the 90s as "his childhood" even though he did live a bit into the 2000s + he could've just forgotten the year by the time the bossfight happens >!(which considering he forgot the fucking *reason he was a hikikomori from the start* I don't think is too far fetched lol)!<
Headspace takes place in the 90's considering after Defeating mr,Jawsam there is a photo of hero that after interacting with it,It will say 199X -
In my mind SOMETHING was very late 90s or very early 2000s, with RW early 00s. That said, we don’t really know when head space was set: is it the year before SOMETHING? Earlier, before much of the time away from friends practicing and stress of the violin kicked in? Or an amalgamation of his childhood?. . It’s very possible spent his childhood in the 90s and opened his door mid 2000s; if born around 1988ish, he would be a kid in the mid-late 90s and open his door in 2004ish.
Heroes of Might and Magic (which oddly enough actually *did* have [a Gameboy version]((GameBoyColorvideogame)))
Probably my left testicle and one of my kidneys, but it’s worth for lil’ hero scrunkle.
Too much, but I will still buy hero
WRONGGG!!!! Hero wouldnt have a hater!
 <------- her probably
I mean whos gonna take her word for it, also im pretty sure she would still date hero in a heartbeat
The sprout moles would, and yeah she would switch to loving Hero as soon as she gets the chance.
And as I remember, she had a fangirl, didn't she?
“I worked for Bossman Hero, he’s a fraud”
"Mom the other kids are drinking i need you to come pick me up"
I can definitely see him going. But it’s cause he has a friend who goes for them and knowing Hero, he can say no when invited
He said that he didn’t make friends in college
Do you think he just there, thinking the whole time: “I wanna go back to my dorm.”
Got that hikikomori mindset
Hero could be an introvert at heart, he probably goes partying only because he can't say no.
I’m fully capable of holding a conversation and reading the room, yet I’m a full-on introvert. I can interact with people easy enough. I just need a lot of alone time to recharge and often prefer being alone. Hero can be an introvert, even if he’s good with people.
Hero is the oblivious Himbo, liked by everyone on campus.
Agreed.. . We Stan the Oblivious *Latino? (I have no clue and i feel bad for not)* Himbos
Oh! That’s cool I didn’t know that! Would have been cool to see something more obvious in game tho like maybe hero speaking Spanish to his parents or something
Hero is canonically implied to be unfit lmao
>!Doesn’t he go for a jog every morning in the real world?!<
Did you just call hero latino?
Hero slays and absolutely drowns in pussy tf you talking about
Idk about slaying and drowning in “pussy” per sé, but he’s definitely drowning in **something** for sure
# Hero fucks.
 >!fucked!<

Hero is the designated driver
not op
Im 3 yrs late but if im still scrolling thru old posts im sure someone will stumble upon this.. . I realllyy doubt that, hero \*is\* naturally really calm and peaceful infront of the kids, other kids his age or even older, and in his college (this is shown both in headspace when they talk to literally anyone else and whenever they mention his social interactions at school, hes really js known to shut away from weird cheeky stuff because hes not into that kinda stuff, also contributing to why he doesnt have (m)any friends at college) and his parents know him to be this way too. thats why he gets along with the younger ones anyway, because hes not into cheeky stuff, more in the simple, quaint stuff along w mari, since theyre both naturally those older siblings enjoying simple kid stuff. hes just naturally that mature, reliable, studious, talented kid tbh; i genuinely cant see him in any other way, so im pretty sure in this line hes referring to what hes heard or like maybe he went to a college party once to see how it would play out and then never went again / went home immediately when things got.. weird. OR hes js a designated driver who passes out water at the party lmao
Not really, Hero is a kid in the dreamworld but I do see him being pretty friendly.
Didn't he mention elsewhere in the game that he's been so busy with studying that he never really had time to make friends anymore? He could just be going to the parties out of obligation without being wild like the others.
> never really had time to make friends. . Damn, maybe Kell and him >!could have a duet so Hero finally has time to be with his brother?!<
That does kinda leave a lot of room for interpretation though. I could see him going to college parties and just not participating in all the drinking and weed.
Yeah but he’s the designated driver
He's the designated driver
i can definitely see him as the type of guy whos handing out glasses of water to drunk people while talking about how to prevent hangovers
wait where is this in the game
It’s in the base game. The couple that you help throughout the real world will invite you to a housewarming party if you help them, and Hero gives this line if you talk to him during the party.
new console content
I'm pretty sure this dialogue is nothing new, and is in the steam version too.
When I purposefully spread misinformation on the internet! 😹😹😹😹😹😹
Haaaay come on now. Maybe they’re just stupid
yes
i didn't see it or remember it being in the game so i assumed it was console content zamn
I mean sure, but saying it's misinformation is funny
yk hes wild
I mean compared to that party, even a pretty simple college party would be less “quaint”.
Hero is literally the guy who would say “Aw shucks guys I dunno about this one”
Hero is the designated driver
I can imagine Hero just getting drunk/high asf when there are no kids around so he doesn’t have to feel responsible.
I feel like he went to one, saw what they were like, and immediately left
Hero does not go to parties. He is kept awake by their loud music at 2 AM.
The only time we really interact with real Hero is when he’s either stuck in front of his overbearing mom or babysitting. It’s clear he has a wild side (that Omori knows about, hence the new Jawsum content)
interesting how you interpret hero as a crazy corporate guy being … a wild side, its js him being inlove with corporate stuff as an ingame villain (goes to show that hero is so gentle & mature that the only villain he can be is a business man) if anything thats the opposite of being wild cs wdym a corporate guy is at a college house party 😭😭 tryna talk about stocks to the herd of drunk college kids
He’s a college student!  Every college student needs to cut loose and get drunk at least once every couple months
How do I trigger this event?
You have to help the couple choose the wallpaper for their house in the hardware store and then the final day you visit their house to help them make dinner and then later in the day you go to their house warming party
Thanks
When does it happen?
i’ve wanted some college party fanart because of this dialogue for so long and i still haven’t seen any :(
Hero is just there to make sure everyone has a safe ride home
He stays sober and drives his friends home

sadness is good late game when you unlock heros dazzle ability
>sadness is good late game. . Real
It’s good because it immerses the player
HERO used DAZZLING GLEAM!
Hero just watches as the team absolutely wrecks the foes.
Angry, until Omori got Lucky Slice, at which point I mostly switched to Happy. Usually made enemies angry for the extra exp as well. I went through a lot of Life Jam until Hero learned Homemade Jam…
Hero's smiley Depression
I’ve been using happy a lot - Dandelion on Omori plus Lucky Slice is good if you’re not sure what a boss does, and Twirl can do MASSIVE damage, which is funny since it seems Aubrey ends up getting a damage boost on it when happy, which means things like 200+ damage with a single skill. . And not on topic per se but bullying angry enemies with mock and smile (Omori and Hero’s skills) is funny because it’s like a 1-turn minimum damage to the enemy at the cost of Hero doing no damage
i always did sad on omori, angry on aubs and angry/happy on kel, depending on the battle tbh. . and hero is hero
Maybe Kel is just the English equivalent to whatever his actual name is (?). . Now imagine for Hero. . Enrique "Henry" "Hero" [Like 5 other Names] [The Most Spanish Last Name you've ever heard]
Yea you could be right
Enrique María Rigoberto Fernando Julián de Todos Los Santos y Hernández
I thought you saw more of Heros face?
"Hero was decimated by Spazmatizm". . "Hero: FUCK"
pursuit hero . . (btw finished reading that for the 5th time. Great writing, but the content within  is \[internal screaming\])

Off topic, but have you checked out [Endless Dreaming]()? It's written by the same author AND isn't as horrifying as Pursuit.. . Also, if you're asking why the names of the writers are different...I dunno for sure, to be honest. I think the author made a new account and moved their not so happy works like YBM and Pursuit to that account.
actually, I have read it!. . it's also really good, probably one of my favorites
I started it recently and it looks pretty interesting
Pursuit Hero AU

They saw Hero with Polly
... How old is Polly? We already know that Hero is 19 years old but I have no idea how old Polly is ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|thinkingfacehmm)
They met Hero from [Dissociative Connectiveness]().
Question: this whole fic saga is good for read?... i'm curious now.
When you mean good for read, do you mean it's completed or it's written well? Because it's both.
Oh okay, well if i have enough time i will read this... and download the fics of course... just in case
Cringey cat girl yandere maid costume......just like hero when i did that

Hero-in

Why is there a hero plushie without pants?
My dad picked him up and they fell off
why not?
I guess you really like superheros
how did you get this many hero plushies
sorry stupid question incoming: why do people like hero?
He’s kind, he’s funny, he’s (sometimes) goofy, I guess this description fits Kel as well, well not that there is a bad OMORI character in the main party, but yea idk hero gives me the highest chill vibes and also bro can cook, how couldn’t we like him?. . Also i might misremember but think he has arachnophobia, relatable. And the kikomori route (I think) part where he becomes a mafia boss, was too fun. . Also feel very sad for him about Mary
I mean I don’t dislike hero but I feel like he was the most lacking out of all of the characters. he was kind of just the talented and handsome guy who is mari’s boyfriend from my perspective. am I missing something? I mean ofc arachnophobia but like who isn’t? those things are creepy.
nearly the entire point of heros character is that he is NOT just the talented handsome guy whos mari boyfriend and that that misconception is whats contributed to making him so heavily depressed and unable to express himself or do anything as he wants to!!  you are missing quite a lot if not everything. He seems like hes lacking on surface level cause hes the only character you have to really look into and analyze to understand all the traits of, but he has equally as much depth if not more as some of the other characters. Him looking like The average joe perfect guy is his defense mechanism at that point
go to r/spiders and you’ll be proven wrong. There is some creepy ones but once you see them as cockroach and mosquito devourers give it a couple years of time and you’ll love em
same reason anyone else would like Literally any other character. Certain people like certain traits and dynamics and i like hero
Where did you get that license plate and the hero dog plushie mad I love them sm
The number one hero fan strikes again
I think he likes the hero.
idk but if one things for certain u definitely hate hero
Hero

i like your HERO lalaloopsy. it is very wonderful.
not hero i though
WHY DO YOU HAVE 20 HERO PLUSHIES
Looking cool, Hero!
lol it’s hero ( this comment is false it’s not )
I think you like hero, cause I see a little something behind you
Counted the Heroes again and there are (give or take) 339 Hero Omoris that’s 36 more than I saw last time. (I almost missed the calendar photos on the edge of the screen…bruh).
Just a hunch but is it hero?
Hero
finally another hero fan
I wonder if after rhe RW hero problem they made less this time
They did. He only had a bit over 1000 while Omori has 3000
THEY ALREADY RESTOCKED PLUSHIES?? WASN'T THE LAST TIME IN CHRISTMAS
Those were real world plushes, this time it's headspace plushes
So they are easier to produce on account of not being real?
I just meant its a different product lol but idk ask omori since >!he created dozens of them!<
Do you know when they will restock again? Just completed the game a few weeks ago
They usually restock once or twice a year!!
They restock around every 8 months, give or take :) this isn't a definite schedule, but around the 8 month mark is when they typically restock!
Damn I really wanted to order 2446 Omori plushies today but they only got 2445
ya figured it out. . 
Thank you for the tutorial!! : D
:d
You can only buy 3 of each character per person
if you get 4 they come to your house and shoot you its true
Love how the title character is the least popular
Probably because most players already grabbed one so fewer people who don't have the plushie will be buying it this time
It's because he's ugly 😞
It's possible they made more of him than others as well, is my best guess at least :o
They made way more Omori than the others. Hero only had ~1200 when I first checked and Omori has over 3000
Did you know that different plushies can be restocked in different quantities?
it's the other way around lmao . They didn't make the same amount of every plushie , they restocked based on popularity .
they were sold out when i tried to get one for myself on my b-day. . much sad
Well you can get one now : >
I still can't afford any of them
its ironic af how faraway hero was the last one to sell out while headspace hero is the most sold😭😭😭🙏
It’s because they made less of hero
IM BUYING ALL THOSE HEROS AND U CANT STOP ME🥰🥰😋
THE WEBSITE WILL BC YOU CAN ONLY BUY 3 OF EACH CHARACTER
WELL ILL JUST MAKE 277 ALT ACCOUNTS
IT TRACKS THE DEVICE YOU USE AND STUFF I THINK. I ADDED THE 700 HEROS LEFT AND ITS LIKE $28K NOT BAD FOR 700 HEROS WE NEED A HERO ARMY!!
They don't deliver to my country... :(
What country if I may ask? Maybe if you have a friend that lives in a country that omo does ship to you can ask them to order the plush and mail it to you
I live in Brazil, the only friend that i have that is from another country is from France.... 😭
YIPPE 
I wish I got paid early -wheeze- But alas I will have to suffer and see them slowly go away
It’s probably gonna take a week for one of the plushies to sell out
831 hero plushies aren't enough, I need more
I wonder if the huge SOMETHING plush will ever be restocked. That's the one I would really love.
I hope they don’t look like garbage like the past drops have been, but seeing them producing 1000+ of each makes me think they will be bad lol
They have been producing over a thousand for every restock, quality is still the same trust
Why does everyone want Hero and npt Omor or Babil?
Given how Hero was the last to sell out last time (iirc), I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't make too many of them and instead made more of Basil and Omori cuz they're probably the best selling ones.
That's exactly what they did. Hero only had around 1200 when I first checked. Omori had over 3000 and everone else was in the 2000s range
Hero had like 3x less stock than Omori
we all knew who posted this even before clicking
They’re a part of the iceberg at this point

WHAT IS THIS DOING HERE
Can I interest you in some Hero art I did you can put on your wall?
I think I know your favorite character, though as subtle as it is, might be Hero.
only flag i will stand for
I wonder how would Hero react to your collection
i think he'd be scared but try to be nice about it like "oh wow 😅😅😅..."
So I have a absolutely rhetorical question. . . If you would visit a games or anime convention and you would find a Hero Cosplayer, would you take them home for your collection? . And if you would do so, how much spider free living space and fresh air time could they expect to get? . . Not asking because I try to find a person who would love and admire me on that level....just out of curiosity, you know...
i will do this with luigi
This is like really genuinely concerning

I’m not telling you to quit having fun, I’m recommending you to go outside, imo obsessing over a fictional character to the point of isolation is mental illness
might be a tad bit obsessed with hero, and also why is there an MURICAN flag right over it? is he patriotic in lore or sumn?

Omg np i love them!!!😁😁
Isn't henry a cognate with america and amerigo?
That is a very impressive collection
hero's birthday is probably like new years for this man. . edit: realized my mistake HAAAJLAJA 😭
i always forget new years even exists cause i only think of it as his bday
you cant escape from me forever i know what you are. . 
Dedication
So I got bored and decided to calculate the total cost of everything from the Omocat store (not including Fangamer) that's in the image(s). Lmk if I get anything wrong because I probably will haha!. . 16x Hero Omori Plush ($28 each - so that's why they're always out of stock...) 1x Headspace Photo Set ($20) 1x Faraway Town Photo Set ($35) 2x Headspace Hero Vinyl Figure ($28 each) 1x Faraway Town Hero Vinyl Figure ($28) 1x Hero Fan Tshirt ($30) 1x "Rose" Giclée Print ($40) 1x Hero Keychain ($10) 1x Headspace Hero Vinyl Figure ($15) 1x Faraway Town Hero Vinyl Figure ($15) 1x Boss Rush Acrylic Keychain ($10 for one, $100 for all - one is at random, so I'll assume all as that's a guaranteed Hero) 1x 3rd Anniversary Concert Wooden Keychain ($10) 3x Omori x Requiem Cafe Keychain ($15 per blind bag, I'll assume it took only 1 attempt to get Hero each time because I cba with probability). . So, with my estimations/laziness in some cases, and assuming that I haven't miscounted and that everything was purchased at full price.... . The total cost is: $852 (from the official Omocat store ALONE!!). . Bossman Hero would be proud 
I'm terrified of saying anything negative about Hero now
well i cant control you but if you want to dont say it to me cause it does genuinely make me feel terrible 🙏
The good thing is that i literally have nothing against Hero :D. . I actually think he's kinda underrated as a character
Very fun I could never afford a collection of anything like this one
Oh mah gawd i LOVE THIS ill pay 19 duodecillion dollars to have this bedroom
YOU ARE NOT SPINNI. . SPINNI WOULD NEVER SLANDER OUR BOY LIKE THIS /j
i say ugly VERY POSITIVELY 🥰
. . You and the plush rn
Also this has major “saw this at the store and said ew ew ew and felt so bad I ended up buying him”
Hero after surviving on nothing but coffee for two years in the faculty of medicine of waterloo

You scare me
i lov him <3. . 
Hero has severe malnutrition 🥀
. . I’m very concerned..
I’m both glad and concerned at this.
peak just peak
Oh my goodness
He looks like a newborn llama oh my god
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS I NEED THIS
I HAD IT CUSTOM MADE ON ETSy
LINK PLSS
When I first saw the AoT versions of these, I died laughing. He's perfect!! 🥹🩷💜💙💖
Hero flat Stanley
That's horrifying. Finally we have solid evidence what hero would look like in a omori au where he is the protagonist.. . Ohmahero or something like that lol
santa hired hero to be an elf!!
Waiting for u/Hero-Omori-Hater 's take
im scared
Hero you ok?. . 
Sieun sky

Correct me if I'm wrong but...do you like Hero?

What da dog doin'?. . 
This would be my wall if I had money.
"there isnt much on it" i barely have the game 
Guys…I think this dude likes Hero.  Regardless I do love seeing the Hero wall. I wouldn’t feel too bad about posting it. That’s just me though.
#1 hero fan on twitter 😯
The way the hashtag just made your font bigger instead of showing as number one 😭

Finally, some quality content on this subreddit.   /j
I don't want to be mean but have you considered taking up other interests or seeking professional help?
Yes💙I rm like this cause i am autistic🐎🐎🐎
I'm autistic and I do NOT do this shit nor do I ever wanna. Maybe you have a different type but otherwise take Drion's advice 😭
its a common symptom of it to be into collecting stuff and have like intense and limited interests we definitely just have different types

# HOLY SHIT IS THAT T A MOTHERFUCKING METAL GEAR RISING REVENGEANCE REFERENCE?!?!??. . 
Where did you get those shelves, and how did you attach them with your wall.

Sweetheart's room if Hero actually said yes.
i think bro might like hero just a little bit
this you?. . 
I think if there are no more hero fans than this guy must've died because damn
This has the same vibes as this. . 
Okay but that one is hella cursed, at least the hero one is cute.
Guys, this may sound crazy but...I think OP likes Hero.
This is me but with Wanderer from Genshin Impact
I think he or she likes hero
Church of Maizono guy might have some competition...
Just a random hero fan

It’s a shrine*

Guys I think he likes Hero

I low-key need that flag fr...(WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY OF THE SAME KNOCK OFF HERO PLUSH? LOL)
Are you perhaps a hero fangirl
Probably would be if i was a girl
I think you MIGHT like Hero
Shark onsie duh. . 
You should have one hero plushie for each outfit
Its spinnileaf im sure he does
i have plenty enough hero plushies to do this i should actually
da shark 
Shark hero just like his boss
Shork
Shark for obvious reasons, he a good worker.
JAWHAHAHAHA

SHARK FOR OBVIOUS REASONS
Shark
3
Third one
Shark hero just like his boss
The second one looks adorable on him. . . baby lemon :>
one of the pink ones!   . Pink is Hero's color trust
1 fits best imo.
The first one because he's a teddy bear in personality
Give him a different outfit every day of the week
All of the above
THE LITTLE BOW
SHARK 
Sharky
aww these are so cute
All togheter
The shark ones very fitting
THE SHARKKKKKK JAWHAWHAW
The first or the shark
Where do you get these cute little fits?
on amazon by searching 20cm plushie clothes😁
I was thinking about getting another one (after my faraway hero several months ago), good thing I reconsidered
wide head hero wide head (same with mine!!)
. . what is he doing outside of the kitchen
For real
YAY!!! YOU GOT THIS HERO!!! 
So talented!!!!
Evolution at work, only a matter of time before we're bowing down to our Hero overlords.
You seem like a normal and healthy person
You can do it, I believe in you!
Come on hero!!
Why does it look like he's being held hostage?
Because he is being held hostage

Reimu abuse
I’m so proud of him 🥲
IS THAT A HATSUNE MIKU CARDBOARD CUT-OUT?!?!?!??!?!?!??!?!!!!!
Unrelated but why do you have an entire shrine dedicated to him
I love hero omori
. . Hes so pretty with the bow
ok but does he know how to MAKE ME A GODDAMN SANDWICH?!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Has he gotten a girlfriend, perhaps?. . If so… get ready for the next decade or so if emotional support you’ll have to give him
. . Garf
len better
Why is there SO MANY CARDBOARD HERO CUTOUTSSSS
I’m so proud of him
WHOOOOOO
GOOD JOB HERO, BABY STEPS! YOU CAN DO THIS 
(psst, love your Hatsune Miku cutout and the OMORI painting
Loved your bedroom!!
OP really loves printed cardboard figures
that little bow is perfect for him  it's so cute
Come on Hero! You got this!
I BELIEVE IN YOU HERO YOU CAN DO THIS <3333
i think kaito should help him
Why is there cardboard cut outs of hero
BAHHSHA THE KAITO CUTOUT IJ THE BACK IS PERFECT I SEE U VOCALOID FAN
Oh, it’s the guy with the Hero mural. Nice.

‘But it refused’ ahh hero
GHAHDHAHAHDHAHAH tjis is so fuckinf real
LMAOOOO
ahh ahh ahh ahh
somehow this doesn't make sense even if you replace "ahh" with "ass"
Did they just find one they forgot to sell in the warehouse or something?!?!?
he just always comes back. . . . (ignore child murderer)
Maybe someone returned theirs
. . LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOO
this feels so cursed
I do not like this image
I like this image
Thanks. . I also like this image
np. . Thats so based
He only now just sold out?😭 I feel bad for him lol
No he sold out a while ago but for some reason went back in stock
Interesting
And only one hero too😭😭🙏
YUPPİİİİEEEE
We already know who bought him
u/spinnileaf are the allegations real
i actually dont plan on ever buying another official hero plushie cause im too emotionally attached to the headspace and rw ones i have right now and treat them like my children. to buy another one would feel like buying a replacement child and mean to the other ones and i do not want to mistreat my hero omoris so i am staying loyal to tehm
OOOOOOHHHHHHH THAT MAKES SENSE GOT IT!1!1! so sigma of you to raise heroldren🔥🔥 (hero children i made that up)
Where can I buy these?
 . . The headspace plushies are in stock!! :3
[here you go friend]()
They went back on sale as soon as I spent all my money 😔
Waiting for another HERO plush to suddenly appear.
YAAYYYY CONGRATS HERO ILY ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
FUCK IM TOO LATE
YES!!!! CONGRATS!!!t5\31hpy:21602
"Im nothing like yall😎😭😭😭" ahh hero 😭😭🙏. . 
Average hero fan
How my room would look if I had money:
And if my room was big enough
Real 🙏😭
fr
Kaito what the heck are you doing there
WHERE?? (unless you mean Kaito vocaloid)
the vocaloid lol
lol for a sec i also thought of V3 too (i suppose you did too at first right?)
Yes loll 
AAAAAA YOUVE GOT THE KAITO DOLLFIE DREAM TOOOOO OMG
had to kick him out when hero started taking up more space but now i have my own kaito collection that he is in💙
OMG FOR REALZIESSSSSSS???? theyre both my favorite characters 😭😭😭
ME TOO i was more insane about kaito when i was 10-12 but he is still my 2nd favorite character of all time.Though i like hero much more than him nowadays
Beautiful collection of Hero!. . Man if I had the space and/or money I would have one of these. Though probably a mix of all the characters, instead of just hero.
Bro might Like Hero idk
If only my parents let me have this kind of collection… 😢
For a split second I thought the cutouts in the first picture were life sized, and that you had someone acquired a huge hero plushie…. Great hero collection though! :3
I want your collection fr
I think you like hero
I have a strange feeling you might like hero
this is amazing
OH SAY CAN YOU SEE!. BY THE DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT!
Hm, I wonder who your favorite character is? (In all seriousness, this is neat.)
Of course, it had to be them, every time.
Hero much?
It seems you maybe like Hero, only a little bit I'm assuming
How your wallet?. . 
Where the fuck do you even find an American flag with hero on it 💀
omg
KAITO
Below average hero fan
all of this in a year and a half is CRAZY work
Is that the hero stuff the custom wood burning lady made in the 10th to last pics 😭😭😭
would upvote twice if i could
WHERE DID THE VOCALOID POSTER GOO
DONT WORRY ITS JUST IN A NEW PLACE IN MY ROOM NOW😸
YAYAY!! WHATS UR FAV VOCALOID?
KAITO😁😁i have a collection of him too!!! but its much smaller than my hero one since i am (obviously) way more obsessed with hero. . 
SICKK!! 
That Kaito doll,
Now the Piapro poster is barely visible

Second is def the highest quality but First release and bootleg have their own special charm to them
Third is just a little baby
We got the Hero OMORI biology chart before GTA 6
Nah next we gonna see a iceberg video for Hero 😭
this is a good idea actually. i could make the worlds most fire hero iceberg

Please do as someone who’s a Hero fan as well that would be so interesting 
im making it rn but i cant think of what to put on it😭i have too much hero knowledge i cant choose anything
Surface level: all the basic stuff you would know about him from a minimalistic play through of the true route. (Why he's named hero, fear of spiders etc..). . Level 1: stuff that you would have to go out of your way to find in a regular playthrough. (The graveyard scene where Kel tells us about how Hero dealt with Mari's death. For example) . . Level 2: stuff you need to use out of game materials to find, (his real name being Henry) . . Level 3: wild speculation and fan theories (Herosaurus implying that he has deep esteem issues, "Hero tagged you meme") . . Level 4: straight up fanfiction and delusion.

i have no idea where to put the stuff on it cause i keel thinking "i think this is surface level. but i have no idea if someone whos Normal about hero would think this is surface level"
where did you get the bootleg from? I like in the UK so getting any omori merch is expensive asf so I gotta make do with the bootlegs XD
from aliexpress!! it was like 3 dollars there but idk if they ship to the UK, theyre also on amazon and ebay i think
ok thank you !! :)
. . My honest reaction to this
Hero-lution
Headspace Hero Phenotype info from r/OMORI 's top Herologist
“he’s weird” IM CRYING 😭
Does this mean my RW Hero is gonna look funny compared to his friend's when when the Restock happens, assuming similar changes happen again?
woah i need this for the rest
Need more
Last one is the best
My hero plush is so overpacked
But can you make it a dichotomous key?
bootleg looks a little.. uhm..special
Oh! How rude of me to assume. You might like Hero instead
Indubitably correct!
unfortunately my birthday is like 7 months away from heros but my family celebrates his every year so its close enough.Beautiful shrine youve got there
Thanks Spinnileaf ✨. Also Sorry for calling you a male
Why does your family celebrate hero’s birthday
Cause we love him
guys i think it's hero
Easy,Hero
Hero.
It's too easy, hero.
You may be lucky and Hero will stay in stock forever, like his faraway version was
Eevee
Beat me to it
Is it Kim?
William Afton?
Something?
I think he likes hero I dunno
Random tree #63
we need you to have as big of a kel collection as u/spinnileaf hero collection
I'm definitely not going to reach that level, but I'm going to make it as large as I can!! >:D
no sorry
THE START OF A SHRINE AS BIG AS SPINNILEAFS AND IM HERE FOR ALL OF IT >:DDDD
My shrine is definitely not going to be as big as Spinnileaf's, but I'm still going to try and make it as large as I can!! :P
Black Ops 2 guy
Is your favorite character hero?
O R A N G E  J O E
Easy, it's Orange Joe
definitely hero.
Hero
Guys I think it's something, not sure tho
Hero probably
Obviously Hero
Ahh a fellow SMOL enjoyer! Truly the best centaur around
Is it Chris griffin by chance
Hmmmm, Hero?
Orange Joe?
Is it Vance?
probably jhon
erm, I think its sans
Is it babil?
I think it's Cris since you're collecting her bf
I’m curious did you make that bracelet? I would love to make you a bracelet something like this. so we can make it better!!! Also nice collection contact me if interested (also not gonna charge cause that’s cringe 😬). . 
eevee
Is that Sans
Immmmmmm idk hero hard to tell really
THAT HERO PICNIC STAND IS FALLING INTO MY HANDS!!!

Having something hero related that spinnileaf doesn't have is crazy
This means that someone has a Hero item which spinnileaf doesn't. . . Folks, someone beat spinnileaf in a Hero competition fair and square. This is insane.
Id argue that i still beat them in a hero competition 😳😳😳 But yes...i have been looking for that standee EVERYWHERE!!!!!! and its out of stock😢😢😢😢😢
You stated in this very reply that you struggled to find that standee for sale for ages, even currently. Yet, OP managed to find one and place it on their room effortlessly.. . It's undeniable that they have a talent for challenging the actual hierophant... I mean, Hero Fan, as they can grab the very Hero merch that can escape spinnileaf's reach multiple times over.
Its easy to find in the full set but i dont have enough money to buy all of them just for the hero one so ive been struggling to find one sold individually it is very hard😣
Oooh that's why. I retract my thoughts
Gimme that damn hero plush😒. . 
. . HERO-BRINE
look who also lost his will to live!
New AU unlocked!!
yeah what happened to his pupils :0
So you're the reason they sold out the first time.
Is this why I can’t get one?
He’s still in stock
Yeah I'm playin cause when I used to be a fan I could never get it. Good to be honest, I'd be broke.
Leave some for the rest of us 😭😭😭
yeah okay but... why...
it's an army...
i would just roll around in this all day fr
>checks username . . Yeah that checks out
90% of the hero posts are just by them at that point and I find it funny
My god
Do you ever like lose track of the real one and scurry around trying to find it through the hero stack. . Or like does the real not bootleg one rule them all
Do they move around at night
just why 
HERO YPU DONT HAVE TO BE LIKE SUNNY AND LOSE YOUR PUPILS
$840 worth of Hero...
share 😞
so this is the one person that literally buys every single plush on the store and then they are out of stock in just 3 days
UR HOGGING HIM >:(
I am glad to not be the only person who calculated this big number.
That is $840 before taxes piled up there.
. . Is hero okay..?
Oh my
I saw that on tiktok
Why do you have so many?. . 
cool :0
You're becoming the hero celebrity around here, how does one become a celebrity on the OMORI sub?!

STOP BEING GREEDY PLEASE SPARE SOME FOR THE POOR
Where's the hero plush so we can finally see who's the taller brother
I unfortunately do not own a Hero plush
MARRY HIM
(as in both your boyfriend and hero omori😊)
Dammit! I was gonna make that joke!
maybe when we’re of age but yes that would be nice😭
I have this same issue my plans of marrying hero omori are wrecked by being 15 wishing you luck
two boyfriends now
Double trouble
Im sorry but I thought you were spinnileaf 😭😭
SAMEEEE
They already have 30 of them, they don't need any more
There is no such thing as too many Heros
W boyfriend
Indeed he is
. . You and your boyfriend. . And hero
Wife him
Husband him🤯
Is your username a jacksepticeye reference
No im just illiterate
boyfried w
Wow cute OMORI plushies are so hard to find!! I have OMORI stickers I got from Temu though I stopped using Temu because of the bad spyware on it.
Everyone is saying “Marry him!” And i 100% think you should wait until you know hes the one- oh who am i kidding. Marry him.
Best bf ever
By that I mean both hero and your bf
Huray!
Good for you! You must be loving that 
Pursuit Hero?
I opened this post knowing it was damn well Spinnileaf's without looking at OP
Man hero's charm really worked on ya 💀
fr haha
a fine addition to the hero shrine
I think you like Hero
At this point the only thing left is getting a RL hero
YOU NEEEED MOREEE
OH GOD THE HERO SHRINE IS REAL
I think they like Hero
holy moly

having a hero shrine would fix me. . THIS IS IMPRESSIVE AS HECK
cute he is
Guys I think they like Hero, not pretty sure about it but just a guess
wasn't expecting that in the second pic
Let me guess...is your favorite character...by chance...hero?
Heroin
do you have a hero bodypillow
i havent gotten one cause i fear what my parents would think of it. But my mom did text me asking why i dont have one yet a little while back
honestly iconic of your mom tbh
Can't call yourself a girliepop enjoyer (mild understatement, I know) without a bodypillow of him
Where would one be able to purchase that
Manifest one into reality
Are you the reason Omocat made the Random Hero Fan T-shirt?
i honestly fear the day if spinnileaf ever stops hyperfixating on hero
it wi'll be the day of his death, and with all these merchs os hero, it will not take so long
Dude i need this in my life so much. . (but im broke 😭)
my good sir, you are on fucking heroin
This is absolutely crazy 
Soon spinnileaf will have another room for Hero merches
thays actually what i plan on doing if i ever truly run out of room
I think he likes hero
I don’t think you have enough Hero merch. You definitely need more
Who is your favorite character again?
this is lowkey insane but i LOVE IT!!!!
Of course it’s a Spinnileaf post lmao. Who else would  have a room dedicated to Hero merch hehe
I'm scared
Isn't that enough for you?
please 😭 see a therapist 😨. . 
All of my therapists have encouraged that i do this since it makes me joyous🤞
Most sane hero fan
So this is what bad mental health lead to
Not necessarily. This is what peace and joy lead to
Ugh cant even collect absurd amounts of hero omori items without someone in your ear telling you to go touch grass anymore 😒
love how anytime Hero is involved in a post everyone immediately assumes that it’s spinnileaf. . it is for good reason i do that too
LITERALLY

Never saw something so emotional...🥹
Why would you do this?
Yipee



Very Good.
How did he get bald?!
His head looks like a peach, I wanna eat it
Mr Megamind
we need to cook
Bro got the KSI forehead 
He must've been studying really hard at that college of his...
LMAO SO FUNNY HOW DID YOU DO THAT

OMG LOOK AT YOUR HAIR

I’m genuinely curious how much you spent on all of that lol
Something around like $2000.impressive for a teenager with no job considering i get it with my own money 😔
I'm really curious about what your parents/guests think of this.
My parents like it and love hero, and we never really have guests so i wouldnt know🙏
Glad to hear that they are supportive.
Jawdrop
yo thats amazing, i spent my teens being all poor 😭. . but if i had money i would have probably did shi like this too haha
How are u getting $2000?
On one hand it is awesome and impressive on the other you need to go to a psych ward.
Waiting for the day the Hero Shrine becomes its own room
atp it pretty much already is csuse my room is so small
I have an irrational fear of you
I am very scary indeed
HUZZAH!
Almost all of these are flammable. .   . 
Do not burn the hero shine 
where do you get the money 🙏
Mostly by selling stuff
think about how many heros you could get if you sold your bed 
Waiting until you get a car and it’s just filled with hero
I do have plans to do this actually i have hero air fresheners for a future car
How long till you expand to the roof? 
I was literally talking about doing that yesterday actually. so very very soon
Bros roof is gonna give in from the amount of Hero merch that's gonna be stuck up there. We're gonna find you crushed under 5 tons of Hero merch after a small earthquake. 
Always loving the American flag one.
I wish to have a shrine like yours.

what number is your giclée print?
130😁
SPINLEAAFFF ! WHERES HIS BROTHER AT? HERO CANT BE HERO WITHOUT HIS BROTHER
what if we kissed in front of u/spinnileaf s hero shrine
Peak
WHY DOES HE HAVE A CIGAR
ITS SUPPOSED TO BE THE PEN HE SIGNS CONTRACTS WITH😭
OH MY FAULT🤕
Its ok my friend said it looked like a dookie so i think i shouldve given it some more detail
"You see, Omori didn't just make headspace"
Mmmnmm….I spy…Nail polish?! :o
apron hero when

hmmmm
Hero took it in the divorce
now i have a mission to find a hero plushie without a nose
I SEE U ALL OVER TIKTOK
I have a feeling you like hero
No way it got even bigger 😭
Question : how much money is this ?
honestly i have no idea it got too big to count accurately ages ago . . but i try not to think about it too hard..
That's better. Don't.
It's been I year since discover your Hero collection!. . . It's so nice to watch it grow :)
Ué the dude From tiktok?
Jesus Christ.
You know, I think you like Hero, do you?
Honestly, I can’t tell the 1 item you added.
Definition of dedication
I'm just waiting for the 50 foot tall Hero Cardboard Cutout outside the house Pic.
I admire the effort but i dont know how the hell you afford all of this 😭
He can be friends with my hero plush :3

Its getting even better. 
how do you even get the budget to do this
He might have a j*b (censored the scary word)
I want someone to make a collection like this but for the most random faraway town character like the preacher or mincy or shopkeep
wow this is crazyy
THE MAVRICK shelf is what the people need
hell yeah!!!!! keep doin what u love g
the heaven looks like that? 
Im a broke bitch fan of Hero im gonna cry 
oh my goodness is that hero from omori?
Nice collection? I think? it might be overkill but who am I to say?
Enough.
*World's end valentine starts playing*
*it means everything starts playing*
*Goldenvengeance starts playing*
*Bready Steady Go starts playing*
You were wrong go back starts playing

Never
Okay I throw you into Vox’s mouth as you’re being like flimsy-hunt on r/hazbin :P
Knew you’d be here
I stand with you against this bullshit, my dear u/spinnileaf. We can be Hero fans together. Though my collection would be only digital lol because I’m not materialistic
Spinnileaf, it's Time the turns table, here.. . . . You know what to do.
*oh no/yes, it's the Hero himself.* 
got chills reading this. please save that por. poor Hero🙏
omg i commented that you were not gonna like this and then i scrolled and saw your comment, thats actually funny 😭
*Omori starts playing*
Spinnileaf wants to know your location
Spinnileaf, I summon you to end this slander on Henry!!!
. . It is morally correct to place Hero in distress
QUIT IT THIS INSTANT
HE MUST BE BITTEN!! . . Full disclosure he is safe he and HS Hero and my other plushies made it out of a house fire that took most of my collection stuff. He is relaxing with the other survivors in a safe bag
Someone gets it
NOOOOO BERO NO PLEASE NO 💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔💔
We found Spinnileaf’s mortal enemy
NOOO HERO MY POOKIE BEAR 
i dont know why but it was actually painful to see the green marker(?) on heros eyes. . like that can take a god awful amount of time to get out 
Not the eye surgery lmao
Exactly it was her idea for the second and third one 
Evil spinnileaf be like
is he high
Yes
HERO NOO 
HERO NOOO 
Leave my baby alone!
Never 
Those who bully  are often insecure, are you insecure that Hero is universally loved?. . Jealousy is a sin mind you/j
Nah he's just a cutie and this is how I show love
This'll only make me bully hero more

Just because of you, I'm going to beat the shit out of hero

He's begging for mercy
*Thy have been cornered*. . 
well spinnileaf is NOT gonna like this 😬
She already disapproved the first time I showed her
why did you show her that, that must be torture to her 😭. . this some evil sick shi 😞🙏
spinnileaf is heading towards your location
Im holding hero hostage
What drugs did he do in the second picture
Thank you for buying a hero one he deserves the love
Can we make a r/foundspinnileaf ?
you gave him all the love he deserves already 😭. . but i see he needs more love cause he's the best 😌🤚
he needs all the love in the eorld!!!😁
haha i see
my bad for assuming this was a spinnileaf post (I have been conditioned to expect Hero merch every time I see posts like this)
Why applogize? I feel honoured to be compared to the GOAT
No, HERO! Don't go towards the light!
Excuse me while I go to the corner and release water from my eyes
This just reminds me, my Plushies are getting delivered today and I'm so scared because of the restock quality drop news. ToT
the restock quality dropped?
No Hero don't do it- DEAR LORD THAT'S BRIGHT
NOOOOOOOOO
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you
hero about to join mari in heaven 
Damn they white washed my man
It's time
It’s time to go to heaven, my child.
YOUR TOO BRIGHT...
MAMA MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIAAAAAAAAAAAAAA........
Hero

Wow looks awesome
Herosaurus? Where?
i admire your collection
Im concerned for your wallet
when the shrine is complete, Henry ‘Hero’ Omori shall be made manifest in the real world
You are a crazy person
No. He's manic.
Spinleaf is the sayaka maizono church guy of the omori community.
I feel like you deserve to see this picture I took today. . 
He looks so pathetic and defeated i cant with him Get up hero!!!!
i think i did need to see this actually im layghing too much at it and now my head might pop. Do i have your permission to tape this image to my wall i need to keep it forever
I'm sorry I just saw this reply 😭 but yes you absolutely can!!!
This image makes a great place in my hero collection thank you for playing hot potato with hero this moment will live forever on my new shelf🥰. . 
Thank you this is so whimsical
hey do you like hero by chance

A new challenger approaches!. . 
This is the vibe i need
you gotta make a video like this fr 🙏
absolutely fire
thank you 😋
WAIT THE OP ISNT SPINNILEAF??
1: do you really believe spinnileaf would have a shelf THIS empty?? and with manga next to it? and with a sunny section on top? . 2: SURPRISE SHAWTY !! spinnileaf isn't the only hero lover. i just can't be that intense... love hero with my big ol heart tho 💙
I thought this is a spinnileaf's post
why would spinnileaf have a shelf this empty
I can already tell this isn't spinnileaf, very very low population of Hero 
thank you! i'm glad you're able to see that difference
Yet all I can focus on is the Giyū plush and the Mitsuri plush
they say hi
when I saw that I thought "lol imagine if that's not spinnileaf that would be so funny". . so basically yeah
surprise !!
how are soo many people obsessed with the same guy 😭
"so many" and it's just me and spinnileaf 😭🙏
nah i've seen even more haha. . but ig you too are the biggest . . (tho spininleaf being the biggest haha)

Is little bit too much 
your instincts are wrong
our hero in shining armor
shining omor
LMAO LITERALLY
it's beautiful
it is beautiful
Now make him a shining armor, therefore we shall have HERO in shining armor!
i hope your mother is lovingly doting on her sparkling grandson <3
wow my eyes-
i got jumpscared
I don't know why but it looks so scary
ahah, true, i finally got hero! had all the other plushies but him
They still aren’t out of stock, last time I checked most plushies had over 1k in stock except for hero
Over 1k still wow... interesting how hero was being the last one in stock the the real world plushies and now is being bought the most. . . Also, I didn't realise you should check the exact stock of a product, do u mind if I ask how u do that?
Not OP, but. . Basically just make the quantity that you want to "buy" set to like 3000, and it'll tell you "you can only add xx amount of  plush to cart" :). . And the reason Hero is the lowest in stock is because they made less of him since he wasn't as popular! Hero only had around 1,200 made, while the others had 2,000 and Omori had 3,000 I think :>
Ohhh okay. And wow that's interesting but makes sense, I didnt realise they had different stocks produced. Thank you for explaining that 🙏
What's your favorite piece(s), official or unofficial? Or, Top 5, Top 10, etc.
i dont really have much favorites cause i cherish all of it equally!!!!! If i absolutely had to choose itd be tough but i like all of the hero stuff from zipsunz shop, the body pillow, and the rose giclee print
Nuh uh you're not allowed to have "Random Hero Fan" shirt we all know you are THE Hero fan ❤️
Fr, thats some dedication tho.. way to go!
Whats new there? :>
I added a new shelf and got all the new official stuff and other things i bought😁😁
Oki
But plz I think I wanna be like u sometime :<. . Idk why lol (I think) but it Sunburn.. but also would have Mari and Hero stuff there :>
how much money has been spent on this?
Yippee
IM SO FREAKING IMPRESSED
Ngl this some dedication 🙏😭. . How do explain THIS to your freinds and parents?
ive been like this since i was around 2 so my parents are very used to it but......i dont have any friends to explain it to.........and im starting to think this might be a reason why😁😁😁😁😁
Imagine you finally make a friend and you find out their name (or nickname) is Hero
aww what a sweet room
Damn how long have you been making this shrine/collection???
Since around september of 2023
:O
Madam, thou hast Hero autism. If thou'rt not diagnosed irl, I as an autist, I give thee the title of honorary autism
I got diagnosed in december and my collection was one of the main reasons it was suspected. When i mentioned it at my evaluation the guy started taking notes at light speed
That's quite cool, actually. Welcome to the club, pal
( ´ゝ`)
*Steals the Hero pillow*
Would anyone be interested in a subreddit for the Omori plushies I have so many pics 
Bring upon it, I'd join
Y E S
He is rocking those glasses so hard
Why is that so adorable lol 😂?
well is he gonna teach me or not
It’s a hero secret. . 
gatekeeper 🙄
What does it say in the book?! I NEED to know how to be successful! 
he is smort :0
. . Same vibe
I didn’t even think about that 
DONT SHOOT HIM
He’s shooting you
I was about to. . . . Then I saw you weren’t spinnleaf
Your animal instincts are trash. You are hereby banished 


BALD
you .. are NOT SPINNILEAVES?????. . how is this possible?????. . 
Yep no Spinnileaf
. . Where he belongs
This is extremely saddening
He’s happy look he’s smiling trust me don’t mind the screams

noooo, they're eating hero
HERO NOO DONT BE EAT OR GUN
Never ask hero about what he did last summer 😰
HERO YOU\`RE UNDERAGE TO DRINK ALOCOHOL SOMEBODY STOP HIM!

To be fair he is a dream so uh...
Ultimate trilogy

#IT'S HEROSTONISHING!!!!!!!!
mogging competition with hero
Polly is tall and Hero only grew 13 cm in 4 years
have neither of you heard of puberty
Still Hero with only 13 cm that much in four years.
yes because age 16 is often the age at which growth begins to slow
Just read the chapter. This might be the best one so far. Hero’s letter really hits different if you know what happens. I get the feeling that they’re going to make Hero’s story even more heartbreaking.
First [this](), and now this. Weed boy trying out Hero's charm technique fr.
He looks gorgeous
I read "nerd" instead of "hero"

Happy cake day!
joyful cake day
I was wondering who herd is
I also read it as nerd too
Same
Hero is literally fit to be a doctor even his hand writing proves so
r/beatmetoit
r/beatmetosaybeatmetoit
r/beatmetosaybeatmetosaybeatmetoit
This piece of lore indicates that Hero is turning into a doctor
Me and hero have the same terrible handwriting
Hero : constantly being mister perfect man. . Wait- nobody's perfect !. . Hero's only weakness :
I like how Hero has stereotypical doctor hand wrighing because he's cannonically a pursuing medical career.
Everyone be teasing Hero about his doctor’s handwriting, but Gino’s handwriting makes Hero’s handwriting look like a Leonardo DaVinci painting.
I think the fact that everybody’s handwriting is very different is really cute. I like how hero has messy doctor handwriting lol 
Hero has the messy doctor handwriting😭
hero can finally be a true doctor
I love how Hero’s is the messiest, really becoming a med student
Hero has the doctor calligraphy
Ngl they look 6 in the game too, except for hero who varied between looking 15 and 22.
Nui only likes underaged man, so hero isn't zesty this time lol.
Uh…what?. . 
ofc nui wouldn't, hero's over 18.
It's like when an artist makes a character look zesty, then the character got zestified like what happened to headspace hero.. . 
What kind of response is that? You're saying less than nothing.. . 'Hey what does (adjective) mean?'. . "OH yeah it means (adjective), like when the thing is (same adjective). Make sense right?". . Literally no description outside of just repeating the word again
make the character more attractive basically
Hero doesn’t look more attractive in headspace???? He looks like a happy kid??
I'm explaining what the word means, man. Not that I think that- idk why I'm being down voteds
I think it’s the phrasing of it. Besides I thought “zesty” was a weak man’s way of saying “this character looks gay/like a f-slur”
I mean i kinda understand it that way tho, i also explained it in the most simple way i could think of. Sorry if it was just nonsense.
I know, but I'm also wanting you to realize that just repeating the same thing without any other form of a descriptor for the listener doesn't help.. . I know what it means, so that's another reason why I spoke up about it, because if I didn't I'd be like 'huh?'. . Not that you did anything wrong, it's just one of those things that, if you were on the receiving end of it, you'd still be confused after asking.
Alr thx for reminding 
Sure he wasn't zestified but they unHeroified him, that is not Hero, where's his stupid hair spikes?
He just got out of the water?
Stupid?. . 
They added a "few" hair lines ig.
Listen man if you think, according to your own definition, that Headspace hero looks more attractive than rw hero, then you’re either 14-16 or you got some reexamining to do
I don't really think that. Rw Hero is indeed more attractive, but not in a way Hs Hero was drew, Real world Hero is just more normal. If you get what i mean.. Im 17 btw. Yes im immature prob.
No I don’t get what you mean, explain what “normal” means in this context.
To be fair... we can't say for certain that he **didn't** at least do something close, because we never see it.  . All we know is that Hero "lashed out" and yelled at Kel.. . I don't think that would happen either, because that's a bit too extreme for Hero to just do if he was at his lowest mental state.
I just took it as like he yelled at him a lot and pushed him to the floor
From Hero to Zero, just like that.. . But wow. I haven’t read the manga, but besides this, is the rest of the scene the same? Like, Kel’s cheering him up, Parents come to comfort Hero, Hero apologizes to Kel etc?. . This is certainly a darker side to Hero. Like some kinda Anti-Hero.
. . An absolute zero, he’s nobody’s hero…

r/angryupvote
Man yall really missed what made Hero interesting huh
Is that from Bossman Hero's part?. (for some reason I thought it was from a Black Space Section)
Yes
This was incredible!!!! Surpassed hero’s cooking skill with this one
Isn't Bossman Hero also in the PC version? Just-not as a boss?
Hero just has to take Jawsum's place in PC version.  But on the console version , he becomes Bossman Hero and fights you.
No, it's only in console version
Oh-to be fair I only played the console version and haven't seen gameplay footage of the PC version so I wasn't sure if Bossman Hero was console exclusive
hero’s teeth look like shark fawns
Bossman Hero is about to become Tumblr's sexyman
Agreed 🤣🤣🤣. I was actually like "wait a minute... Damn he's kinda..."
Please. He has been denied the tumblr sexyman spotlight for too long. 
. . reading the title was enough
THE HERO AND KEL SCENE IM KILLING MYSELF 💔💔💔💔💔🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀🥀
Wait- The new chapter is out already?
Yes they made a post about this one saying itd come on the 22nd instead of 24th for some reaosn
THE SCENE WHERE KEL HAS A FLASHBACK TO HERO GRABBING HIS SHIRT.
Yes, we know
 idk how but you managed to smh make me obsessed with hero too and ngl u have some good reasons he's just so handsome... And cute...and cheerful
It’s a good day for us hero enjoyers
AHHH I LOVE THESE!
THE SECOND IMAGE WAIT 😭😭
Who would of guessed?
oh, don't worry, we already know
Drench Hero my precious 
It's bossman hero himself!!!??
By the way, the author... . . CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER REASON FOR HAKARI KEL TO BULLY HERO THAN AUBREY AND ALBUM BASIL'S REASON. . . Seriously, I thought that I would be disappointed and the reason for Kel's bullying of Hero would be more stupid than the reason for the original Aubrey and Basil's photo album, but no, this is a better reason, since here Hero acted like a real scumbag and he got his punishment, and therefore I am glad that the reason is quite weighty and even better than the original (not for all people of course).
My favourite part about this comic is how you draw the creepy eyes. Since Hero's eye was gouged out in the accident, it makes sense that the eyes would appear to pop in serious moments. I really like this detail.. . Also, could you add the link to the newest episode in the masterpost? I only found it browsing through your profile.
Just added it now. Appreciate the heads-up!
It's nothing
. . Hero😭😭😭😭
He looks like he has to use the bathroom
Why does Hero look like he’s on a Pursuit?
Goku infected him or smth
it's like he's in some kind of Dragon Ball Super Movie : Super-Hero
Does Hero himself knows this?
Supersaiyin Hero? (Idk if I spelled that correctly I’ve never typed it before)
Replace the last i with a a, otherwise very good
OMORI VS ultra instinct Hero
omg hero i was just crying dor so long because i couldnt see him in the chapter cause i was in the hospital😭😭😭💔🥺IM SO HAPPY I LOVE HIM I LOVE HERO OMOEI HE IS MY LIFE MY SOUL MY PASSIONB
hope you were okay
yeah this picture kind of made me realize why you're so obsessed with him ////////
  ✿indeed. I’m a boy so I won’t be gushing over him. But my little cousins? God almighty man one of them in particular is essentially Spinnileaf Jr just without the…*Great Wall*. It’s cute. Because unlike anime she doesn’t bleed from the nose or anything she just beams and blushes and has this dorky laugh. Gotta hand it to Hero, charming folks even through the confines of his 2-D world.
I'm a boy and I will gush over him  
HEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I LOVE HIMSHUAIDAJIDOHUD
Here’s where Hero’s height come from btw. . 
Look at this starving u/spinnileaf, deprived of official Hero Omori content. They won’t survive the winter if they don’t get content soon, they need YOUR help.. . . To donate to your local u/spinnileaf treatment center, call 143-015-0101, and help them live to see tomorrow. 
paige are you okay? the lack of hero omori seems to be getting to you
Its ok i will spawn him💙
you have hero omori spawning powers and you didn't inform the people???????? i wanna spawn hero omori.........

Guys it's litteraly him
Bruh, you don't even need the costume.
Actually these are my favorite kinds of comments thx
Now introducing…Charming Hero! Aka. Malewife of Mari! . . Nah fr this cosplay is so good- 
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|upvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)Hu man (kind) are the unsung elements of the wonders of trying to get it right by doing it wrong.... now the question is we are noticing different things?
Not me YOU, r u expecting change as a present?cognition is harder than awareness for the past couse it rearranges instances of disconnect with cognitive adaptability by universalism way of coping with reality of changing things in our past.
This aint a cosplay, this is Magic spell to bring characters to real life.. . Now for real this is a really good cosplay.
Best comment ever thanks so much that’s so kind
my hero senses are tingling
oh my lordy lord you look PERFECT. hero cosplay suits you so nicely !!!!t5\31hpy:28765
THANKS THANKS THANKS
This your little bro?. . 
Little bro AND first disciple

Bro your literally how I'd imagine he'd look irl lmao
omg ur on reddit too???? yes keep providing hero content to the people
THANK YOU I’m glad you like it!
holly shit, this is one of the first cosplays in this comunity whre i fell like the character is represented perfectly, this is like the TF2 scout/jerma of omori
it would be funny if I threw a spider in here 
any day we're gonna have a full cast for the OMORI live action series.
My true purpose.
You literally are him omg
Damn, I see why Sweetheart was all over Hero
Hero IRL 👌👌👌 perfect cosplay!
That means so much you have no idea thank you 
Only minor thing to make it perfect is just you smiling more tbh, but either way your cosplay is great!
Yeah I’ll practice more stuff with that next time and hopefully get the charm face right and pose bc that’s what I did for my graduation photo lol
Oh god I’m scared of how good it’s gonna be lol, this is also the only acceptable time to use those aesthetic filters to add sparkles
OH MY GOD YOU ARE SO RIGHT
Just be wary of… Certain pink-haired individuals 

>!You are just a dead lover away from Hero!<
It even seems to be cannon 
you look like someone i would see on a walk :3
Def one of the best hero cosplays I can feel the charm radiating off of the photos. . Nice cosplay!t5\31hpy:2463
blud looking like a handsome young man
literally hero 
MY HERO SENSES ARE TINGLING
Remember: only hero fans are sane in the omori community
You looks so handsome! 
How- It is him!
this is just a normal man. this is like cosplaying just, a person
Bro even got the rizz
Bro is dripped out 😮💨
You look like you ate an entire lemon before each photo . . This comment was written with good intent and is not an attempt at making you feel bad, if i hurt you im sorry
Omg it's so good, I think you should keep an eye on the Space bf poster from hunting you down
I would believe that Hero would look like that irl
Dang we found the real life hero . . amazing cosplay!!
DUDE THIS IS PERFECT
as a HERO fan, i say ya get a thumbs up from me, good job
Bro cosplaying without cosplaying
IKR ITS THE BEST
This is bloody brilliant mate

I DO BUT SHE DOESNT HAVE ANY DANGEROUS BROTHERS IM FINE (She’s @luxxezi on tiktok btw)
That's great to know, be careful though 💀
Give us the charm smile!
this is amazing what
Bro really put on a blue shirt and called himself a HERO. . but if you really wanna seal the deal, you should go get a goku haircut.. . Afterwards, buy a 2 liter coke bottle and take a sip whenever somebody calls you a dragon ball z cosplayers
Natural hair never fails me
Live action remake when????
What cosplay? All I see are the in-game sprites.
Bro thought he would post in game hero and gaslight us into thinking it's a cosplay
It's literally Hero from omori. WHAT
Yall i think we found the real hero from the hit game omori
Hero omori real
Are you on tiktok? I feel like I've seen you before
Orangejackfalcon yeah that’s me lol
Hero is real you guys
Why is this so good lmao.
Barely a cos I got the fit from kohls and I’ve looked like this for my whole life
Hey, I think I've seen you before, on tiktok! Were you the one who made the one where Hero goes "MY HERO SENSES ARE TINGLING" and then sprints to the lake?
Bros looking more like Torta than Hero
You guys are the best I love these comments I’ll post more vids and stuff soon but if anyone has any ideas please let me have em 
It's really him!

This is not a cksllay, its just Hero pretending.
I get what Hero was on about now
😂😂😂
Bro if hero irl
this is quite literally hero omori. what's up henry
Henry?
Hero is just a nickname they gave him because he likes hero sandwiches, Henry is his actual name
I didn't know he had a canon real name. That's interesting to know!
we're getting live adaptation of omori before GTA VI.. this is crazy...
Dont speak it into existence
this is literally what i imagine he looks like
Bro might actually be him
What the fuck?!
u/spinnileaf what do you think of this man
Ive had multiple discussions with my friend about how this guy is the real hero omori befroe
He would kidnapped him
I feel like I have to say this every time I post but I have to blame my phone for bad photo quality bc no matter how good the focus or lighting it always looks low quality/grainy
Hi
Hey
. . Sir, is this perhaps your dead gf?

GET THE HERO SIMP. NOW.

There's people who are fans of Hero, then there's Hero kinnies, and then there's you
:O
Ritchie Valens!?
He must be a good cook
well heh hello handsome
Even the kitchen is the same lol
Omori hero edition just dropped
HELL YEAH GIVE ME THE HUSBAND MATERIAL

wait i thought it was gonna be spinninleaf. . but ig surprisingly its someone else this time. . but he might be happy about this news :0
trust me. spinnileaf already knows... also, he's definitely not the only big hero fan, i just can't afford a shrine like that 
ohh haha i see
yeah i've been sending spinnileaf like every detail of my hero cosplay LMAO
wow haha thats nice
Yeah I like big hero too. Especially Baymax
LMAO
I got told they were a girl... 
i think they are now but it's still kind of confusing to me to be honest... im trying to avoid pronouns but it's kind of hard  i've been trying to use spinnileaf as a pronoun because idk how widespread this information is 
My sorce is them.... so I think I'm right.  But also, the idea of spinnleaf being a pronoun is very funny.
yeah i talk to them sometimes so im aware of their different name, but i get so weary about pronouns what if someone arrests me for being wrong 💔 PLEASE DONT ARREST ME SPINNILEAF 
They had a different name? Are you saying that they used to identify as male.... Did they swap to female so they could be with Hero?! . . I'm joking of course... or am I?
lowkey can't tell if you're joking or not
I think I am. I genuinely don't know what I'm on about sometimes. 
for a while their name was oliver now it's paige, at least on reddit it is, not everywhere yet. i'm trying not to spill details without their consent. but i feel like the name is a pretty obvious thing if you've looked at their profile and noticed a change
Same I 100% thought it was spinnileaf
Spinnileaf is a she btw
Really? I did not know that.
plot twist??? like wow i see now
Spinnileaf will find where you live
i wouldn't be surprised
TRACER!!!11!1!
Actually my first thought before I saw what subreddit it was
Me too
I guess someone *heroic* lmao. . But genuinely looking good from someone who doesn't have a clue how wig styling goes in practise. It's recognisable for sure
Is it heroin
yeah 😍!
I recognized him as hero immediately!! Great job!
YAYY THANK YOU
Has to be the goat. . 
Your Next Line Is " IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE!? " Right?
spinnileaf is gonna get you 😭
i don't mind a picture with the fans... or i guess one fan..!

thats what I thought b4 I saw the sub lol

that's fine, if they come after me i can sneak past them and steal some stuff off the hero shrine when they're not looking 🥰
Holy shit the hair is so accurate it's scary
well, it is a cosplay!
Be careful.. spinnileaf is coming 
i hope they bring me a hero trinket 
Lmao I didn't see the sub and thought you were gonna dress up as Sora

hero with a cunty face mask
LMAOO
Sora from Kingdom Hearts! :D/j

Ok, that's Omori for sure
i didn’t check the sub and thought this was tracer-

TEEHEE THABKSS
I’m starting to think the “literally hero” comments have gone to your head a bit
To be fair this is like the 2nd video ever
Still, whats in the video is also alot
Variety
Shhhh community members with gimmicks are the best ones.
"the beat kinda off, this shit kinda trash. but i'mma keep rappin' cause the beat really ain't that bad"
Any hero born past 1643 can’t mourn healthily. All they wanna do is heal, be greedy, go to college, cook they egg, eat life jam and lie.
This is too well-made lmao, how many retakes did you even have to do? Horrific to think about.
Since I didn’t have anything at all to do in the morning I spent roughly 45 minutes putting everything together I think the first shot took the most tries 😭 the last shot was very first try though and the fall was unintentional but already perfectly cut
Can’t relate, still stuck in high school for my last year lmao
I’m also not that good with tiktoks interface at all so setting it up to record like 1-2 seconds for each scene and having to get a stand and then put a 10 second timer on took patience
Still better quality than 90% of the content I’ve seen tbh
But he wears the maid outfit like a champ!
hero moment . . also this song combined with the captions and the video is the goofiest thing i have ever seen
Hero is malewife incarnate and I love him for it
i love opening reddit and seeing irl hero
 Capitalism

“This is a pigeon” UGHGEHEHGEHEGEHEG. “This is a sound of a lottery machine” GEHEHHDBDHINDHDJ. Such inspirational words 😭😭😭
homemade hero cosplay???
I approve
That’s fair I guess. I think she’d still forgive him at some point though. Probably right next to Hero.
She bullied Basil for quite a while without thinking at least once that maybe she's doing something wrong and this is all a misunderstanding. That was until Hero arrived and I'm not sure if Hero will be in the mood to tell Aubrey about her own mistake.
i do like the idea of hero being less forgiving, as he’s always the bigger person, but this could really make him snap
it's canon baby, hero heard that piano /s. . Probably not but it's fun to speculate on.
Hero's smile in this list looks so full of anger.
Well duh. Dude represses his personal feelings for the sake of others. He’ll be seething inside until he gets some therapy.
Hero is accurate but even then I still think "Hero tagged you" memes are funny, albeit ooc
I disagree. Hero knows exactly what it’s like to blame himself for Mari’s death. He had Kel and his parents to help him out, and it took him a year to even try to get better.. . Sunny had no one and took 4 years simply to tell anyone he was hurting. I think Hero would connect with that and his protective instinct would kick in over any negative emotions.
> Hero knows exactly what it’s like to blame himself for Mari’s death. . . Yes, but by the same token if Sunny and Basil hadn't covered it up Hero would have never blamed himself.
Kel didn't even do any wrongs here towards Hero, he was angry all on his own. . Also I never said that it was easy, but that Hero is not some brute and surely wouldn't bully or hurt Sunny for this, especially when he is descripted as pacifistic in nature, he is no brawler, only in headspace and not even that is wholly true.
why does everyone think Hero would take so long to forgive him???
Yeah, but I think hero would be understanding. If anything he’d be relieved that her death wasn’t his fault
I understand people saying Hero would be more forgiving, but Kel is probably Sunny’s closest friend. He never seemed as close to Mari as the others, and I find it hard to imagine him not forgiving someone Hero forgives more quickly.
I think Hero would be quicker to forgive.
i saw hero's and immediatly this vid came to mind. . 
Hmm I disagree… they bickered a lot in the real world too. And they only made up after Hero intervened. Without Hero showing up, their personalities clashed so much that they just escalated situations that could have been resolved otherwise, leading them to grow further apart.
ayo what is hero doing in that last photo? 🤨
Hero was whitewashed too
yep! They're VRchat avatars created by Dr Herobrine!
I'm pretty sure that's hero's job
I'm the in middle of math class trying not to laugh at this
NOT THAT KIND OF "BONE" THO! 
It's funny because it involves teenagers participating in ******* penetration
Incest
The fuck? 
I'm pretty sure it's just because he struggles with cardio.
I always assumed he had asthema
True, he was the most tired out after climbing the big ladder to space
Because he seems to be fit enough to not hate exercisem.. right? Well, in the headspace he hates it, and he's in Pajamas and with messy hair. I saw someone else theorize about it being because he wasnt taking good care of himself after the incident, and maybe the disliking excersize is part of it, losing motivation to do anything and going outside, and excersize is usually done outside... Headspace Hero is sad :(. . Edit: he's also got the lowest speed and attack, and sometimes when your sad or with low motivation sometimes you feel slow or weak (as I've experienced that before)
Hero's attack is low not because he's weak, but because he doesn't want to hurt others. >!Omori is the most dangerous of the group (and the only character to use a true weapon) because Sunny killed his sister.!<
I would say a postbox counts as a proper weapon
In a more cartoon violence way, I guess, but a knife is a real serious weapon.
I think he's fit because. 1: he's drawn in an anime artstyle and most anime characters are fit whether they exercise or not.. 2: he probably eats healthy.  No real evidence for this, but he seems like the kind of person to do that.. 3: he may not like it and has low endurance, but he probably does still get some exercise.
and wasn’t hero literally exercising in the prologue
i thought he was asthmatic LOL. oh, also the main 4 (omori, hero, aubrey, kel) are all in pyjama-y clothes, especially aubrey and hero though, since they’re in like ACTUAL pyjamas and not just a vest and boxers
Headspace characters were made after the incident, but Sunny doesn't know how Hero coped. It could be that in Sunnies mind, they don't have work or chores and are playing all day without formality
Hero is somewhat fit. He mentions in RW how he goes for moring jogs.. . Kel is just has more conditioning than Hero
How would omori know that? He hasn't been interacting with hero.
Im like how in the real world Hero talks about how hed going for a morning jog the next day when they sleep over at sunny's. Hes been getting better:)
Wait, you get the book already? Damn, since when did it come in?
It's a booklet thing i got in the case for the switch edition of the game-- funny story I actually didnt open it until my bf came over to let him play, then I saw it and got way too happy lol (same with the sticker it came with but hey I have a soft spot for stickers too lol)
Good job spreading the good words of OMORI to another, my friend! ~~MANIPULATE THEM IF YOU MUST-~~ I- I mean... Have fun!
Oh I bet Hero threw all the instant ramen in the toilet and now that's the only place you'll find ramen in headspace.
Pretty sure in reality it's a reference to some meme/photo of some girl eating ramen out of a toilet
I could’ve sworn he had asthma or something and that’s why he gets out of breath with cardio.
Apparently it's noted that Sunny is aware of the on goings within faraway town, perhaps what he's heard about hero through someone like his mother influenced his appearance and add in that childhood imaginative (traumatic too) filter and that's DW hero
I didn't realize that about him, dang
a college student disliking instant ramen is a modern age tragedy
Hmm relatable
hero is sedentary
I was skimming through it and read the last sentence as "he'll whip you" 
He's just like me... He's just like me for real 
I thought it was that he had 0 attack and had drawn on the one attack star himself but they all look like that lol
His luck is too high in that. Need to bump it down a few steps
How dare he dislike instant ramen 
He'll whip you when you're feeling low
His defense is pretty high and his heart and juice is also  good. His luck should be a bit higher, but yeah he is not a fighter, but a healer, befitting of a hero such as him. Hevis pretty awesome!
If you don't like instant Ramen you an npc fr...
He dislikes instant ramen
: its ok my little gordan ramsey :what
He hates w h a t?? Instant ramen is amazing
'Tis outrageous indeed but then again I wouldn't eat it if it came out of a toilet lol
My friend would though 😭
greag
greeg
sorry
john
What's the connection?
I made a comment since it would be too long for the title also very mild spoilers
Is that an official book or smth?
Is that why i find ramen in every toilet in headspace
SOOO......what's the connection?
Yep. That's why Hero was [>!hit so hard by her death.!<]

I actually feel like Hero was the least affected which confused me, so I came to find threads on Reddit about it lol
>!I'm pretty sure if you go to Maris grave at the church at 3-2 days left Kel will go into detail on how the incident made Hero so depressed he didn't wanna get out of his bed or do anything for like half a year.!<
They probably h\*gged too
Oof

Smart move
You fooled me-
What did it say?

No wonder hero was *depressed*
Hero: Hey I'mma call mari I wanna kiss her. >!Wait she dead WHY IS SHE DEAD!!!!<
Just wanna say, please spoiler tag/nm
The post is already spoilered y'know
Oh my bad ..
No biggie, it's still good to spoiler that shit anyways ig
Well you've got Mari teasing Hero in headspace, some of the photos and >! Hero being hit the hardest by her death !<
im p sure all headspace does is imply hero was born in the 90s. fifteen years later of course is in the early 2000s
The 19XX under Hero’s portrait in Last Resort is meant to show when Hero becomes the Boss - replacing Jawsum.. . The Present is likely 20XX, but the past (and therefore the recital) is meant to be in 19XX.
Asthma doesn't make you physically weak and we know Hero goes for runs every morning
hero is currently doing your mo

Hero the Milfhunter?!
Kakyoin will be proud of his son

-Hero had his own Headspace when he was depressed, but unlike how Sunny was the hero of his Headspace, Hero was the liege of his since he blamed himself.. . -Kel kept the Scooter Gang in check by himself before Sunny came back, but could only deal with one or two at a time, so they were able to continue doing bad things.. . -Aubrey never went out of her way to inconvenience Kel and/or Hero, only fighting back if Kel was trying to stop them.. . -If Sunny had a proper Headspace equivalent, he would wield pole objects because of his violin. In the same vein, if Mari was a fighting party member, she would wield heavy objects, since a piano is heavy.
Sunny did receive therapy long before the events of the game during that 4 year time skip but it didn't help much due to the way he was.   .    . Hero still cooks but as a hobby and sooner or later he will get another girlfriend equal to or much better than Mari >!(after all he can't continue to be attached to a dead girl xd)!<   .    . Basil doesn't have many relatives other than his grandmother>! (may she rest in peace)!<   .    . Kel hides a lot of his emotions with a smile, he will actually be taller than Hero when he grows up, secretly he is a caffeine addict and thus the reason why he likes Orange Joe so much.   .    . Aubrey is the product of an unwanted pregnancy and therefore her "family" fell apart since they were not ready to take care of a child, she has bad luck or in general she attracts bad luck... her only lucky moment was at the lake when Hero came to the rescue.   .    . Mari was actually a lousy cook and hence the reason why Hero was so good at cooking... since he was the one who cooked for the whole gang, Mari learned a few things from him but she was still a bit bad anyway in the kitchen.
(Not so secretly a caffeine addict )
Indeed
My other headcanon is that Hero is a Soldier main. And that Mari and Hero constantly commit Soldier Boyfriend and Medic Girlfriend
A zombie apocalypse starts in Faraway Town and Sunny, Kel, Aubrey, Hero, Basil, and Mari all have different roles at the base their holding in Sunny's backyard.. . Sunny's Job: Sunny is the hunter of the group and will go out in the wild to find animals for Hero and Mari to cook. Sunny also protects the base from infected and bandits.. . Kel's Job: Kel is the guy who goes out and tries to find weapons or anything the gang could use to survive. Mainly he loots out gun stores, illegal black markets, or tool shops.. . Aubrey's Job: Aubrey is the only one in the gang who truly has street skills and fighting skills so she goes out and seeks zombie nests and blows them up with explosives that are provided by Kel and will also find other survivors and try to trade with them.. . Hero's Job: Hero is the medic of the gang and is there when someone is wounded and needs treatment. Hero also cooks food for the gang so that they don't starve.. . Basil's Job: Basil is Hero's assistant who will go out and find herbs or plants that could be used for medical supplies. Basil would also go out and find people who are in need of medical assistance.. . Mari: Mari helps Hero with cooking and also makes sure the base is okay and doesn't have any spots that the infected could sneak in through.. . This was an idea I thought of because I'm kind of obsessed with Walking Dead and Dying Light along with Omori so excuse this cringe idea lol.
Hero is afraid of spiders because he woke up to one crawling on his face and that just made him go "Nope no thanks "
Hero finds in college a way to deny his pain, more than just a responsibility
🎹: ` HERO plays guitar `
Hope he doesn't start a vendetta by beating Hero up
Herosaurus! (Blackspace)
Idk why people headcanon Hero as being furious at Sunny. Like yeah Mari was his soulmate but like out of all of the characters in the game I’d say Hero shows the least aggression whatsoever. When he’s mad it’s really that he’s just annoyed. I think he wouldn’t react as strongly as people think.
Cuz Hero be like:. . . . OH MARI!
I think Hero would be relieved first. His girlfriend didn’t kill herself. It’s not his fault. Then he could get mad, but only after extensive crying.
The least aggression, unless you do the Scarebro thing
I feel like hero would realize that he has to step up and be mature so he pretends to forgive him but he’s actually just suffering inside. maybe, maybe not.
nah. . hero just goes full on rip and tear
WHY DID HERO MAKE ME LAUGH SO HARD
[Hero Tagged You]()
lmaooo
Also it could give Hero some kind of relief because after she died everyone believed it was suicide and Hero was questioning whether it was his fault for not being there enough for her so to hear that it couldn’t have been his fault might finally give him some peace
That too. It’d give him a morbid sense or relief to know that it wasn’t his fault, as that was the only thing keeping him from moving on.
as someone with hero as my favorite character, it's sad that fans treat him like that ;-;
Yeah, while I personally consider Hero to be the most boring out of the 6 characters, he still deserves better than what both the fandom and the game has given him.
Here is a completely false thingie:. . : Aubrey would be mad and try and kill sunny,. . : Kel holds Aubrey back but is also distraught at the news.. . : -doom music intensifies- hero says “Let me take care of this…” Hero then grabs a double barrel shotgun and chases sunny down, Hero kills sunny, Hero sees basil running for his life. Hero eventually tackles basil and -BOOM- Basil is dead. Hero, looks at the bloodshed decides to walk towards kel and Aubrey.. . : What. The. Hell. Hero?. . : You just. Killed my friends… Why……... . Then suddenly the ghost of Mari shows up,. . : “Now that’s my hero!”. . Suddenly, Hero loads in another two rounds into his shotgun.. . : YOUR NEXT!!! NOW RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!. . Both kel and Aubrey split and run like hell,. . : RUN AUBREY! IM GONNA TRY AND GET HIM TO STOP THIS MADNESS!. . : KEL NOOOO!. . \-a shotgun blast is heard and kel drops to the floor- -hero realizing what he did, is distraught-. . : What have I done? I killed sunny, babil, and my own god damn brother…. . \-Hero suddenly dies by a brain aneurysm.-. . \-Aubrey will never be the same again, and spirals into a deep deep deep deep depression she may never get out of.-. . \-but the story goes on-. . :Hiiiii Omori and Basil, are you still mad?. . : What the hell is wrong with you?. . : It’s alright Hero! You were just mad!. . \-hero breaks down crying, sunny walks away, and kel comforts hero, Mari is also there-. . : Hi hero, it’s time for you to look at me. Lettuce seek revenge…... . : IVE STILL GOT MY SHOTGUN! -BANG-. . \-and the story ends with Mari dieing… AGAIN-
Hero Tagged You . . 
Of course he is, he’s fucking Hero.
he’s doing what with my boy 😟
IM CRYING
hi crying
Hi Alan, likes and Nintendo
hi, thats not my name but ok
ik but i wanted to make it like- (im not even sure what i wanted to do is Alan ok?-))
Ybm Hero sucks. He's ugly af
there is a hero cosplayer that looks so fine
who ?!
Fine-Pomegranate4712 here on reddit and they also have tiktok, twitter (ig idk)
i too am holding out for a hero
“I NEED A HERO!“. . “I’M PULLING OUT FOR A HERO ‘TILL THE END OF THE NIGHT!!!”
His name is hero for a reason
about the door at weathervane that causes a crash in >!dark space 2!<. . today they added patch 1.0.2 fixing a few softlocks , hero's key ingredient in wet docks but the door at weathervane stays he same , it keeps crashing the game.
I havent made a post that doesnt revolve around hero in like 4+ months im gonna go bonkers this is uncomfortable
Wait you can do that????
if i try really really really really really really really really hard. But not at all if it doesnt involve hero in at least one way
did hero use a pen by any chance??
i feel like hero would make sense as natsuki, given that he’s a baker, but the personalities don’t line up
Basically, Hero would hesistate on forgiving
Uhm, is this the one where Hero hallucinates and has a very fucked sequel?
Why isn’t hero’s smile an emote
We can’t have nice things (Please, let all the Realworld friends smile Mods!)
I strongly disagree on Hero but yee
he would be more angry about the lying and faking a suicide, hero blamed himself for not seeing her signs of depression, and he got to experience the horror first hand when he went into his backyard to see her hanging corpse, he was so distraught he couldn't even visit her grave for 4 years and he was in such a slump he hasn't made any friends and quit his dream profession of becoming a cook just to escape his pain. . and to find out not only the love of your life's brother accidently killed her, but also him and your friend went and took her corpse to fake a suicide will break hero in every sense
i like your theory but the reason i think hero would not forgive sunny. . &#x200B;. . is because from hero's perspective he felt like he failed Mari, he did not recognize her signs of depression and suicidal thoughts and thought her death was on his hands, he was also traumatized from seeing her from his backyard. . the person he loved most the love of his life was dead, and for years he thought that it was his failure that caused it, his stupidity and failing to see her.. . and come to find out not only did her brother kill her, him and his friend had covered it up with a suicide.. . he would be mad about the death, but he would understand it was a accident. . but lying about it is what would set him off, this is the man who has been so depressed that he hasn't made any new friends in 4 years he hadn't have even been to her grave in 4 years. he gave up his dream into becoming a chef just to avoid the feeling associated with Mari, and now her brother has come and spilled all this to him.. . and then sunny leaves, he moves away, hero has to sit with all these feeling and anger without the person who caused them. . however i do not think at all hero would hate or even dislike sunny, he would still love him and care for him but some things are just unforgivable and i think for me personally that this is it for hero.
Those are also good points
You can't be friends who someone you didn't forgive. That would be toxic. . . Also if you think hero would not forgive you missed point of the game.
It’s typically used in media, when there’s no core problem with the book but there’s all these little problems adding up to its failure. . Replace the problems with hints and the failure with a yes and you get hero and Mari. . Sure, it’s never bluntly told to the player that make and hero are dating, but if you have a brain you should be able to work out that they are
So it would mean "confirmation by a thousand hints" here. Certainly, I get your point but I still believe that if we were to look at it from an analytical point the ship is cannon, but not explicitly confirmed. I bleieve something hinted at can be cannon and part of the story without it being confirmed. This is a matter of confirmation, not of truth
You seem to mix “confirmation” with “bluntly telling the player”
Perhaps we have different standards for when a game confirms something. Because I indeed count confirmation as explicit amd blatant
I for one love that the game respects your intelligence and lets you work out with your own brain that mari and hero are/were a couple
Indeed, the game does its storytelling excellently, no exposition or awkward explaining. You gotta figure it out by yourself. Reminds me of how Ishiguro does his world building in his novels. Drops hints everywhere, never explains anything
A lot like in soulsborne games, too
I mean, Hero did say he only had eyes for Mari(in Sweetheart Dungeon), Mari liked Hero not for being smooth, but for something else... They flirted with eachother, like when you talked to Mari as Hero she'd say "What's cooking, good looking?" and they mentioned how badly Hero blamed himself after the events before the game... I think it was at least 90% certain
Its 100% certain. That doesn't change the fact that it never is explicitly confirmed in the game.
Its pretty ambiguous, but if I have to pull a relationship out of the cast, I think its the most probable. Basil seems to be more of a hero worship thing with Sunny to me. Kell's only reaction to any kind of romantic action was to act sick, dude's probably asexual. Hero still doesn't seem to be over Mari.
So this is where Bossman Hero came from.
RW Hero knows no stonks
 have a bowl mister hero
How else do you think Hero paid for college?
Hero also could her the piano sounds so maybe
So while I don't agree that the left hand font signifies that someone is traumatized, it is implied that Hero is also traumatized by the event. . . So we know that Sunny's fears have only worsened during his 4 year isolation. We also know through Sunny's dreams that Hero is mildly afraid of spiders.. . But when we see Hero interact with one, it's pretty clear that he is more afraid of them than before.
That’s a really brilliant theory, and it would make sense with Hero having the type of personality to put others before himself. He would definitely take on the guilt as his own fault
Man this is such a good take. Need more Hero theories in this sub.
Doesn't matter if you're reading too much into it. It adds more potential character depth that Omocat may or may not have actually envisioned. There's nothing in the game that directly contradicts this thought process, and thus, it's totally plausible for Hero to think this way (especially because it's in character). IMO, it would be totally within Hero's character to think this way.
damn... poor hero
Jawsun surley depicts the fact that Sunny thought his dad likes Hero more than him, like when he said “hero, I always saw you as the son I never had”
Hero is just everyone's favourite child huh
hero moment

I already related to Hero too much and then I learned his original design had glasses and I lost it
The Hero parallel isn't one that I've seen mentioned before, that's a really good point!
very sharp analysis. I feel like people usually don't bring up how Kel acted really badly toward Aubrey at game start, and the Hero-Sunny parallel is really insightful. I really feel like Hero would forgive them in the end, maybe even before some of the others, as he seems to be very emotionally mature, and has changed a lot from how he was all those years ago
Also Hero when he sees a spider: \*Transmutates into literal rock

If you want to know how close you got to accuracy click the hidden text. It will contain no spoilers other than what you got right of course. >!Good job! For what information you have thats a pretty damn good therory. Its imposible to guess the true answer in the begining but for what info you got good job!!<
Hero is like Harry, he has potential for all of the houses, but doesn't want to go to Slytherin. Where does he go?
A few reasons, mostly having to do with dialect and location. . . we first know Faraway is in a standard American suburb , which doesn't give much clues. However, the term "soda" is overwhelmingly used on the upper East Coast, and the NJ/NY area is the only area in the entire country that refers to hoagies as a "Hero". It's also known they live relatively close to a beach so this makes sense for New Jersey, which is very coastal. Northern New Jersey is more suburban and less rural but you can also argue Southern as it's harder to tell the location in New Jersey, but given the dialects and how Hero is is used in Northern NJ, it makes more than enough sense to me. If anybody has better ideas, I'd love to hear them. I think there are some other points we made and I might be able to edit them in when I'm a bit less busy
grew up in northern NJ and as a little anecdote, most of the things they grew up doing definitely resonated with me; same with the architecture in the game, and with the hero sandwich being a thing. i would’ve guessed either east coast or west coast but after i realized that not everyone in the US calls that type of sandwich a hero, that does make me think this’d take place in northern NJ
I grew up in New Jersey so I definitely can relate to that lol
yeah right? I grew up and still live in PA and have gone to Northern NJ multiple times, and from what I've seen being around over there particularly in the suburbs it makes a lotta sense
This is now my headcanon. It's realistic and please I just want it to go this way and not something bad.
Oh youll make me blush, thank you so much for such kind words! Believe me, wanting everything to be ok is pretty much my only coping mechanism, haha
No problem, hehe.
Now? Hes got everyone to save him from drowning. And theyll never let him fall below water again. In my head, atleast ^-^;
I definitely think you're right on Kel seemingly taking it the best, but I really think that's just him not stopping enough to fully process it. He'd be on his feet hugging Sunny before he even starts putting together his own feelings on the matter, and I'm not sure if he'd ever get around to sorting them. . . As another sunburn shipper, I'm not really sure how Aubrey would react. I don't think it would be immediate forgiveness though, more like silence.. . Hero is definitely the least fun to imagine. Out of everyone in the cast, he's by far the least expressive of his emotions, usually just playing it cool and being the voice of reason in the group. Whenever I think of how Hero would react, I almost immediately remember the story Kel told about the night where, around a year after Mari's death, Hero had a complete meltdown on him in the middle of the night. There was namecalling, insults, and a lot of tears that kept going until his parents woke up and came into the room to hug him. I don't think that would happen in the hospital room right there, but I do think that there would eventually be a day when Sunny and Hero, or even Basil and Hero, were alone and he wouldn't be able to hold it in any more.
**I like it,your theory make the game less depressed**
That’s a very interesting and well thought of way they could have reacted. But personally I disagree with the latter half of Hero’s reaction. He’d probably be out of the workd after hearing that and the rage would overtake him. Not much would happen, as there would be the others but Hero couldn’t hold his emotion at that moment.. . Still very good!
u made me cry on hero's part ಥ‿ಥ >!he has to be strong because he's the only older sibling figure they can rely on there's no more big sister anymore ueueuueueueu｡:ﾟ(;´∩`;)ﾟ:｡!<
Oh please dont cry! Im glad the scene touched you so deeply, and im so sorry for making your eye balls all watery!
Big Sis gone ;—; only Hero now
this theory despite having some details I think it is accurate.
Hero Won 
RW Hero is my favorite so I'm gonna say he won. As an alternative winner, {insert your favorite character here} is cool too.

Thank you
I feel like all the older peeps like hero more while the younger fans gravitate solely to kel and basil
Hero definitely needs more love, but Bagel's birthday is coming up soon, so he'll get his love a bit later.
Random Hero Fan, at your service
Thank you
hero appreciation post incoming soon
Thank you comrade
Well in italy a famous streamer have done omori in live, at half gameplay they had to add a "hero step on me" cheers button, the chat was going nuts for him, lmao.... . Me too, I'm a bit of an hero simp ( and basil)
All characters are based. . That includes hero
Agreed
We need HERO week

Hero has always been my favourite.
Random hero fans ASSEMBLE!!
Hero > Kel. Fight me.
ZOH MY GOD HERE THEY COME ON HORS
Plus Faraway Hero is hot
no hero is a chad. . he really is the true ***HERO ;)***
As much as I relate to Sunny, Hero is someone I'm crushing on the moment, and it's rare for me to really have a crush on anyone.. . Guess I now know what my type is.
hero is my favourite character yeahhhhhh starts with h my fav letter
I just noticed Hero was smiling before he died
And thats how you know acceptance was made
Hero D Cook
KEWL got 1k+ on crop top hero. She’s an excellent example of art that’s eye catching
We don't talk about that one 
Indeed
Hero from hit game OMORI

what's hero doing?
the hero we need
Please help I’m filled with 57 different kinds of bullets
just spread some life jam on there
For some reason that doesn’t work in real life and now my insides are filled with jam
Hero ftw
If nothing can ruin my life, this subreddit will.
Yeah, it kinda feels like that sometimes.
Hopefully it won't.
Guess how this subreddit make me restless. It's 1 fucking A.M now. I know I don't need to be like this but my heart keep forcing me.. . Yeah, it's my fault and I know that, no need to tell
Why obsess over a subreddit?
Least chronic redditor
You thought I could sleep easily when I see people treating kewl like trash in this subreddit?
Because we can.
I’m gonna be real honest here, this subreddit is  garbage
This subreddit isn’t on a downward spiral, it’s a kamikaze plane flying towards the ground
This sub gives me the same vibes of a group of toddlers squabbling with eachother over which fictitious relationship is true
Yeah at this point im like "wonder what absurd thing this community is doing"
This seems to be the case for most subs sadly..
I swear it was better even less then 6 months ago
Console release of the game was late June 2022. About 8 months ago. . . This is what tends to happen to a community when there's no new content related to what they are fans of. By a few months after the games release, or in this case, rerelease, there's nothing new to say or do. . . Every discussion has happened. Points have been litigated and relitigated. Fan artists who made delightful drawings in the wake of the games release moved on to other games. And all that's left is people who are either late to the party, or weirdos who are overly obsessed with it. . . And the result is a decline in quality of the community. You get people spouting the same shit again, and again, because there's only so much to say. You get low quality shitposts, endless fucking tierlists, weird fanfiction, and people unironically having the sorts of arguments people would have had ironically when the game was still new. . . And it's at times like these you need to remember the famous words of Revolutionary Fransisco De Miranda "The only thing to do in America, is to leave". . . There's no way to claw back to the way things were. Now the only thing to do, is to leave.
It's either drama or low effort shitpost trash, at least these maid drawings bring more art to my feed...
I can't remember the last time I saw an art post on here that wasn't kewl's art
Fr, it’s filled with trash memes and trash meta posts
I gotta be honest i only joined for some good omori memes. The shipping stuff is rather cancer
that's right.
It was good like 6 months ago then suddenly went to shit
Fr, like, op says theres too much drama then posts about drama. Like be the change you want to see in the world
I mean, we can only go up from here on out! It’ll be awesome, I can feel it. 
Real
It's nice when you only pop in to look at fan art and avoid the cess pit of comment sections lol just wish there were a better way to filter out the lazy meme posts like that "how did she get stuck" post and nonsense like that. . . I say avoid the comments but here I am replying to one. FR tho I rarely read the posts and had no idea about this drama, I just look at pretty art. So much better than interaction lmao
never thought the Omori fandom would get as toxic as 2016 UT
Oh, BELIEVE ME it's nowhere near 2016 UT fandom
I think it's more annoying, not worse, but more fucking annoying
definitely, old UT fandom wasn’t as annoying, especially to the community themselves, they were usually just hostile and toxic to others (source: guy who sadly was there)
vanish thought rustic special subtract wrench payment recognise chubby shelter. .  *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact]()*
Literally all fandoms have both good and toxic people, stop comparing them.
Oh jesus, it's rare to see people from back then.
I was very active during the 2016 UT boom, and honestly, the fandom was probably more toxic, but oh my god the Omori fandom is by far one of the most obnoxious.. . Toxic? Probably not, but VERY MUCH annoying and obnoxious.
I swear I've seen you in another sub before
FINALLY SOMEONE FUCKING SAID IT. FUCKING FINALLY THANKS YOU AHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHH
You're welcome. . Here's a glass of water, stay hydrated
I wont stay hydrated 
\[Breaks your jaw and pours a water bucket in you mouth\]
But It's time to drink water
Yes, please stop attacking Kewl. She's a person too. You wouldn't like if you were to be attacked, would you?
Man I didn't even know that that hero art was problematic to some mfs when I saw it I just said to myself "you know that's a slightly cursed but pretty good piece of art goodjob" gave an upvote and left💀
It's realy unfair.
unlucky for you, im a masochist

im sad i cant find the omojis
It's on the text box (are you on mobile?)
yeah
It's on the text box on the right, near GIF click on it and then choose an omoji you like 
me when i cant find it

it finally appeared

I feel like the community has been under a "cattle effect" since the Bubbly-Datura drama. People saw others complaining and being negative, and felt encouraged to do the same, and this has been going on for quite some time. Ironically, the fact that we can post about the meta now might have made things worse, since it's easier to spread drama through posts
Yeah, it was a mistake. r/omorimeta was a better place for these discussions than here.
Finally, someone said it. I'd give you an award, if I had any. . . ~~^(Tbh, I somewhat miss the times when Rule 5 was more strictly enforced. Back then, the sub was kind of bad, but at least it wasn't a toxic cesspool.)~~
Yeah... it's kinda hard to properly judge rule 5 though so I prefer it to remain as it is.
Yeah, I guess that's true. 
I hope the mods finally revert their mistake of allowing Meta posts. That may work fine in subs with mature people, but most people on this sub are literal school-aged children who shouldn't even be playing this game in the first place and who are prone to making up fake drama over inane shit
>revert their mistake of allowing Meta posts. . Nah, they allowed because we insisted so much. If anything, it was our mistake
Yeah, me too. Meta tag was a mistake.
Why are people attacking Kewl? I get that she draws hero in feminine clothes and stuff, but that's not a reason to attack someone.
Sadly, no community is safe from hateful people. Stuff like men wearing feminine clothes is still really widely frowned upon, which really sucks.
You were expecting the mass of comments taking offense about content, *that the userbase has been up to this point rewarded for making*, to suddenly stop rather than continue piling on against everything else that offends them in any other way?. . The community was rewarded for its purity spiral, and now that a major reason people come to this place is for the sole purpose of sneering there's really no shutting it off.  The contributors leave, the sub dies, this is how it always happens.
Eh, I think this sub is ""dying"" because it's way too diluted. But that's to be expected and it doesn't seem like anyone cares enough or wants to change anything about it
I miss when the subreddit was just silly little jokes about our silly little game 
Hey we can still hang out with our little jokes.... . Nothing a little push can't fix

Your art is beautiful, and the purity police are far overstepping their bounds. And so unfairly inconsistent... You posted FemHero being cute and get hate, I posted actual degeneracy and was largely ignored.
another character break just to say that it's probably a good idea for us to stop dwelling on stuff from the past and just have fun doing what we're doing now. . people got banned, fair or unfair, and people being offended by hero wearing stuff should simply block and move on without being a loudmouth about it.. . also can we please have more active people . . just because already active people are banned doesn't mean you have to be inactive
Every time I check on this sub I only find more drama and more disappointment. It's unfortunate, considering I quite like this game.. . Unfortunate as it is to say, this sub's moderation team, as of right now, has *worsened* the cycle of user drama rather than stopping it. The fact only a single member of the mod team that I know of has made genuine, actual effort in continuous user communication is a problem. Your silence is deafening to us. I no longer enjoy talking here.
I'm sorry, I'm trying my best :'(
you, specifically, are doing good because you actually put in the effort to publicly communicate with users and answer glaring questions about ongoing situations . . thank you
You're welcome. I've been modding on Reddit and Discord for a while so I know how important the user to mod communication channels are.
I just moved to Japan but also I have been lazy and neglecting this subreddit. I'll try harder.
This fandom has been simping over the gendervent version of Kel ever since Omocat made art of her, but now that Hero is getting the same treatment it's a problem?. . What's going on here?
Some people are hypocritical on this sub.
Bruh people were upset over Hero? It's not my thing but mfs you call Basil a femboy all the time!
Yeah, it really shows the hypocricy.
this sub is probably one of the worst communities i've ever seen and or been in, the kewl hate isn't right. even if i'm kinda iffy about some of the things i've seen them draw of hero (speaking on my behalf, some of the stuff makes me uncomfortable, that is NOT kewl's fault.) i know they don't deserve any of the hate they get. they're a talented artist and they can draw whatever they'd like when it comes to hero, seeing as he is an adult.. . some people in the sub need to grow up and move on, can we stop with the unnecessary drama and be a normal fandom for once 
yeah. we just all need to stop giving a fuck. i been trying to meditate to learn how to let go of useless internet drama, it’s gotten so bad that it effects my day to day life, like my REAL life. the internet can be such a nice and cool place, but it can’t be when we all keep butting heads and shouting about things that really don’t matter much. someone got banned, okay, talk about it when it’s relevant, then let go after a couple days. someone made femmy art of a character, okay, let it go. someone made a boring/loweffort meme, okay, let it go. . . nothings ever a big deal if you don’t let it be.. . we all just gotta keep chuggin along and doing what we enjoy, not dwelling on the negatives of this sub, or dwelling on things that are already over, that we don’t have the power to change.
genuinely most sane redditor tbh. i learned this lesson a while ago. just learned to stop giving a shit about whatever shitty opinions someone has online, see something i dont like? okay, thats annoying, moving on. i barely even comment on shit anymore cuz like, why? people really just need to learn to stop caring about that stuff because then it just becomes an endless cycle of people going "i dont like this thing" and others going "i dont like that people dont like this thing" etc etc... thanks for this comment lol. people often dont know how to separate real life from online and its very unhealthy so im very glad that ive been past that for a while. proud of you for also taking that step.
you calling me the most sane redditor made me giggle a little irl (i commented this from inside a Institute For The Mentally Insane)
You get it. . 
i realise now this comment is kinda hypocritical considering i been commenting and engaging with drama and shit since i got here, but i’m honestly just sick of everything. and i think i’m finally starting to change a little. it kinda hit me last night that i’m not doing too good (obv that’s not 10000% because of r slash omori LOL) and that i’m not really a good person, and i probably won’t ever be one, but atleast for now i can try do my part on the internet to make edgy 17 year old omori fans giggle at their phones a little. atleast then i’d be making some kind of impact, and doing something decently good, instead of *literally being hikikomori* ??!!!?!! did i even PLAY omori ?????!!!!!!!????????!!!!!! graveyardrushhour go touch some grass
I wish I had an award to give this post... Kewl really doesn't deserve the hate she gets
i came here for memes so...
And you SHALL stay for the memes.
THIS. i honestly felt so bad for kewl for getting all the hate they got... like its so baffling how people were mad at them for "lewding" a literal ADULT LMAO 💀 and as a minor i would much rather have people lewding an ADULT (hero is very well ~18-20 yrs old) than any of the kids/minors??? i really liked their hero fanart, and i sure don't want them to stop drawing him, but with all the unnecessary hate i wouldn't blame them for being a little hesitant :\
If I could give you an award right now I would. All of what you said is absolutely true.
*Why did I see 2 disappointed Spamtons.*
How?

It must be a pc thing because it looks normal to me.
This is just Reddit being Reddit. Everyone will get bored and move on to the next trend eventually. This is evident by the fact its been like 2 days and someones already made a callout post.
I'm so glad I don't have a single clue what you're talking about and I wouldn't change that for a second 
Wait Sigma8k is gone too? Nooooo!
What in the fuck is happening?
Caos... A lot of caos
As if this sub isn’t dead already, just let the curtains fall and let’s forget about this already
[I turned away from this sub for a week…]()
Man, I have missed out on a lot of activity from being not active on this sub. What on Earth is going on? Sigma8k is banned? Damn.
wait there's drama? I'm just here for the occasional neat fanart. Why people gotta make things weird...
I...I just joined this sub a little while ago because I have been a fan for years and years......what in the world is going on??? 
Unfortunately I feel like this sub was always gonna end up like this. Omori is a one and done so besides the random art pieces and merch drops there isn't going to be anything new added so there is only so much for the community to talk about so drama and crazy were the only other options.
I agree to all of this. Im here for OMORI. Thats it. Full stop. Idgaf about any reddit user bs, none of that. I want to see cool stuff about OMORI, not people bitching.
Ive been considering quitting the sub (even though i still love omori) bc of everything. The hero drawings were one of the only reasons i havent yet... i didnt engage in any of the drama, but seeing so many posts flood the sub is exhausting.
Datura literally got banned from the sub for breaking rule 1, though. The one that’s most closely linked with drama. She started a lot of it and was suspected of trolling in the past. . . As for Reddit, as a whole, people suspected she was downvote-botting bubbly but if that isn’t the case my guess would be her getting mass reported by people.. . Most people agree the Reddit suspension was unfair but the ban from the sub was for a clear reason. Totally agree on the kewl situation, though.
Datura was banned because what Datura did, but she overdid it so she got tempbanned.. . Then the mass reporting came in and she was banned entirely.. . But then her sentence was reduced to 1 month. . That what I collected
I'm gonna take a screenshot of this before some mod ban this xd
i think the mods will agree with them
Oh okay, but i'm save this already.
From what I’ve seen no one on the mod team really wants this post taken down. It’s probably staying up. Someone had to say this shit and I’m happy and grateful OP did. People have been dragging on drama for literal weeks at this point and harassing people.
I'm thankful!
What I appreciate on this subreddits are actual posts about the game, not all of this memey shit
i don't want this sub to have the same fate as r/onepunchman for me.. . i still want to enjoy this sub like i always did 
Me too mate, me too
this is my second sub on reddit and i already feel nostalgic for it . . i don't want it to fall into ruin man
ngl this art shit is similar to btd6, someone will draw a female monkey but if the monkey's chest is round in the *SLIGHTEST* people will be like "thIs IS nsFw!!!!" "WHy aRe yOu DrAwiNg PoRn" like.. ***JUST IGNORE THE ART OR BLOCK THE USER!!!*** 
I took a break for like, 3 months, what on earth happened here?
What always does in the age of Twitter. . Drama
Me who barely uses reddit these days: i like your funny words magic man
Yeah. I've not even be here for long but it's already starting to get grating. The only stuff I've been seeing is low effort shitposts, drama, and drama responses. I don't get why people can't just behave, and contribute in a meaningful way. I joined because I loved playing this game and just wanted to consume more content, but I've kinda been avoiding it, aside from the occasional notif, just because it's not really much fun to browse rn.
Not too sure with the users and even the drama, but what i can say is dramas happening on the internet never ends well, and tbh there's too much circlejerking
Ow, got called out hard for my previous activities 
This is the reason why yiik will always be the superior rpg. yiik gang forever babyyyy
the ONLY comment in this entire thread that speaks nothing but facts
nah bro they don't have trollface so yiik is sh\*t/j. . &#x200B;. . trolloff forever/j

The Consequences of the Bubbly-Datura Drama
This subreddit is basically drugs. It damages braincells but you can't seem to stop using it.
Wait ppl are attacking Kewl? But they’re cool!
Gave you an award. So fucking true its annoying to see all these drama I dont even care for. Some people are too terminally online lmao imagine attacking an artist over that
Yeah, it sucks.. . Thanks for the award btw
*You* are not helping. Stop perpetuating the cycle.. . It isn't helpful to kewl nor yourself to confront the involved people in this manner.
You're *supposed* to move on rather than continuing a cycle of hostility. You're not helping anyone by going around in retaliation, it's just encouraging the user who initiated the original hostility to retaliate back. I know that game very well. It is time-consuming and pointless, and benefits nobody no matter how long it lasts.. . Whether or not you forgive is an entirely different question- but regardless, you move on, because you go past the point of the input being helpful.
If that way of thinking was correct, then you would've been banned a long time ago for continuing this negativity. If they're recognizing their faults and apologizing for it, chill out dude.
I agree, mostly. I would like to say that people should be allowed to civilly voice there opinions on things. If people don’t like Hero being dressed like that they should (within reason) be able to talk about that. Threatening someone is all to far. Much like you are voicing what you think about the situation, someone of a different view point should also be allowed to complain, even if it’s against your views.
Couldn't agree more on this thing
Ongod we in a civil war rn and it isn't hot.. . Like cmon I just want to see some good Omori fan art in my notifications. 
truly a legend, he said what we were all too scared to say.
This is why you should accept what the present is and live with it
You're a courageous one, finally someone did this. Thank you.
true
So how long before this place crash and burn
Finally someone said it, thank you good person
Your welcome
What the hell happened? I was mostly away from reddit for the past few days and have no idea what you're talking about (except hero in a skirt, that was cute)
The mods made a statement about it. Read their post about February 2023.
Preach!!
Hero from hit game OMORI
I think that this sub really needed something like this. This stupid toxicity is really tiring, and I want to see the fandom become better. I hope people listen to you.
I originally joined the sub to check out any discussions and fanart and whatnot but for the past few months I can't help but just ignore almost everything in my feed from this sub. Whether it's low effort memes, unfounded hate for nearly every character, I was always hoping this game's community would turn out to be a wholesome one, but I swear it's mostly chronically online 14 year olds.. . Some of the fanart is still nice to see though.

What?
hm?
Bubbly getting banned for jokes OUTSIDE of this sub is the dumbest reason for a ban
It's almost like you didn't read the post above.
It's almost as if your point is bullshit
"...and this sub as well"
Well let's be real fair, the sub isn't as big as it used to because the game isn't as big as it used to be. That's the main reason. But all of these factors do add onto as well. Me and Datura have had some squabbles in the past but yeah she was a great part of the community and I'll be happy when she returns since it was a temp ban right? Yeah the actual drama is cringe. How is someone gonna get hate for drawing a character of age, that makes no sense.
It is though, in terms of members, it is steadily increasing.. . Back in 2020 we were in the 80 thousand mark I believe.
Oh nu, jokies.
Idk why but that art creeped me out but I wouldn’t attack her for making it
I’m sorry if it creeped you out.
dont apologize. His/Her fault for not tolerating. At least he/she didnt hate tho
Probably because this fanbase is notorious for sexsualising minors and we have become paranoid to it.
Yeah
who gives a fuck omg get off reddit😭
Facts lmao holy shit
Was Bubbly’s age ever confirmed? I really think he may have been a minor himself.
It doesn't matter if they're a minor or not. Sexualizing minors is not allowed on this website. That's all there is to it and that's the rule that the mods of this subreddit are bound by.
It is in no way fetish art. First you hate on pin, and now me? Why can’t people like you just block me? And you had the fucking audacity to call my art “degenerate”???? What the fuck is wrong with you people.
As I said before, it is NOT fetish art.
That's a problem with the site, the game is not for underaged users as it contains themes unfit for such an audience.. . . If they wish to play and socialize on a subreddit about said video game, the consequences are their own.
Exactly
Not exactly, depends on the community.. . Omori is a community for a mature game with mature themes. The reason unsafe posts are banned is because the characters of the game are underaged with one exception and that's Hero. So mods just do the easy and effective thing and ban any blatently unsafe posts. Regardless, this subreddit is still not for children and that's as clear as day.. . . I like to mention a second point here. Crossdressing, is not sexsual. It's a manner of expression. There are some guys who are feminine or effeminate and express themselves that way. If Kewl wishes to draw him as such, it is still not sexsual. It's just yet another headcanon.
You keep assuming that I’m a guy which I’m not. YOU see it as fetish art because YOU sexualize it. If you don’t wanna see it THEN BLOCK ME. The option is RIGHT THERE.
I permabanned them for this comment chain. If they keep harassing you via DMs or on other subreddits use reddit.com/report to tell admins about it.
Thank you.
Perming you for this. I literally just said that this needed to stop and you disregarded it and sent more harassment anyways. Block people if you don't like it, you'll have much less issues that way.
Oof, we're hurting.. 
Yea because you people say shit about my art. Don’t like it? Block me. If you wanna keep seeing my art then don’t block me. But if a certain drawing you don’t like shows up then Scroll. Past. It. Stop commenting hurtful shit. Y’all are literally gonna make me stop drawing just because it’s something I like drawing Hero in.
I.. I literally LIKE your art!!  I never once insulted your artwork, all I did was make a comment referencing all the Hero art on the subreddit with a Hero emoji ()
Keep drawing Hero it's cool as hell 
Still tho, it was kinda hurtful when you told me to “stop”.
And I get that , especially considering the literal harrassment you've been recieving, I never intended to hurt you and I don't want to be associated with haters. . . From my perspective I log on and suddenly I've been flashbanged with a bunch of Hero art on this sub and I'm just like " What's going on?"
Hi mate! Sure. Interesting choice of profile pic there...
yea
What tha hell happening over here?
this just makes me sad to see
I didn't even know about half of the things happening in this post but thanks for informing/spreading awareness of this!! 
I wouldn't say it's just this sub. It think this generally extends to the whole community.
I think Datura's been unbanned from reddit, i'm pretty sure.
Did I miss some sorta apocalypse event here? Things have really changed :(
Yeah there’s a reason I don’t say anything on this sub and just look at the posts on my feed in passing, y’all are a…rabid bunch.. . I hope your post knocks some sense into this sub and it changes for the better (a miracle I know but I do mean what I said)
I came to this subreddit for theories and fan art, not “ooh this person that comments a lot got banned” “haha burger funny ayo the pizza here haha the same joke I’ve already seen 50 times already peak comedy!” “hey I made a character tier list that is literally the exact same as the last 20 posted today!” “Don’t agree with my ship? Go commit stairs!”.
I’m just lurking at this point broskies
people are weird sometimes
Damn this dude has so many pings. Shame him for not answering his ping
all of these pings are server @everyone announcements
You can turn those off you know...
wait you can?? i always just marked the server as read to get rid of them
Notification settings, nothing
ah, thank you!
I wonder if this feels like pain. Since I don't sit on any public server since 2021.
Fuck you bot. I hate you
Just say saikusbot delete...
Thank you. I did it all by myself. You will get zero credit

i saw that and got excited lol!
I'm not gonna do that. Not gonna touch vc.
But why wouldn't you want to be Hero?
>!Not very easy to hear the truth as Hero!<
they cant make him buff, he cannonically hates exercise  . edit: It was written under a picture of dream hero in the little booklet that came with my game
wdym, only in dw, irl he goes for morning jobs and is kinda athletic
Yeah he has a trophy on it if I remember
And he isn't buff in the game
He doesn’t hate it. He willingly gives up hide and seek to do exercise. He’s just not athletic or anything. Which could be interpreted as even more a reason to not make him muscular
Twink hero. . Bottom text
Bottom hero. . Twink text
 <- bottom bunk enjoyer
...should I tell them?
no you should not, Hero sleeping on the bottom bunk is a secret. . /j
they mean sex positions
No shit sherlock
fucking read it dumbass
I fucking have? Dumbass
maybe cause the community rules are no sexual content or discussions bum boy
Did u call me fucking bum boy?
yeah you are a bum ☠️
Im offended...😠😠😠😠😠
im sorry pal i love you
Lets make out then
🙏
😘

Im going to find u pookie🥰
Oh my
Im under ur bed
what the hell happened
Hm?
went from war to kissing 
Yeah~~~ making out
Its obvious the mf knows what they are talking about but chooses to use it as the whole bunk bed thing
its really not
The fuck u mean😭
How stupid can u be man💀
no way you got on me over a fucking comment you fat lazy tub of lard 
What?😭🙏
you spend all your days on reddit grease boy 😭🙏 i think your family misses you
Im laughing my fucking ass off
ur delayed 100%
U too pookie
Nah but tf u yapping about
Wdym bruh
man upvoted his comments 
U too bruh its on auto
Reddit forces you to do that dumbass
209 days ago this happened
bitch boy this convo ended four hours ago
I want to be the bitch boy😔
I am aware. That's why I made the bottom bunk joke, and then included tone tags when I said him sleeping on the bottom bunk is a secret. The joke is that I took the expected sexual context and turned it into something else.

YOU DON'T FUCKIN' SAY.
Hero text. . Twink bottom

What’s his number how do I text him?
no! no exercise for Hero! he spontaneously combusts when he comes into contact with sweat!!! y'all are killing him!. . /j
 (he’s going to explode)
Ah shi-\* bang \*
> Runs 5 meters on a treadmill. . . > Fucken dies
yeah i'd explode if hero was buff too
Buff pursuit hero
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
I want lanky man Hero. Built like a fucking twig. Tall man. Elongated, if you will. . . That is all.
So you want him to look something like this?. . 
perfection.. . /j
This is the second best image I’ve seen since I’ve become a part of the fandom
thats literally just an image of him from the game. of course we want him to look like that/j
i swear to god if they make hero more masculine i'm gonna commit one warcrime for every real number between 0 and 1
I don’t care, Hero is Hero and I would  love to see more of him in the manga
What's up with the whole buff Hero thing all of a sudden?
Oh? Other people are posting about buff Hero? I just posted this because I stumbled across these posts on tumblr and agreed, I wasn't aware that that was a thing the Omori fandom was doing now.
It goes something like this but hero does it three days. . 
Don't make Hero hero
When they make the character look how they do in canon and not how I imagine them:. . /j. . ~~BUFF HERO ISN'T REAL BUFF HERO ISN'T CANON DON'T DO THIS TO ME~~
If Hero is buff there will be no edging i will just bust
Obese hero
I cannot even imagine it. Hero being buff..
Hero shouldn’t be like ripped, but the game makes a point to show Hero became more atheltic when he grew up. It’s part of his character where he has to be good at everything, even things he didnt like (like excercise, as shown in the dream world). Twink Hero only lives in my heart
I still wonder why Hero is the only one in headspace that becomes black and white when scared
I'm giving you an upvote in the hope that your heroic attempt to avoid future confrontations in the comunity will be successful
Honestly I just wanna see cool art and shitposts instead of people arguing over the sexualities of traumatized children
another reason to give yourself upvote, you have the blood of a hero that the courage to save the world.. . (don't take these compliments so seriously, they're just for joking [even if that's the thought])
I just wanna get back to borgor, pizza and orange joe jokes.. . I also really enjoyed people describing/screen capping some of the more obscure parts of the game.. . Such a big iceberg in this game!
Real world Hero 🤤🤤
what if hero is a died ?
>!Hmm, idk. Maybe Hero would turn into a version of Something, or something like that.!<
Is that Hero as Gold from Lost Silver
yep and he's a died
No hero? 

descuida :D podemos trare de vuelta a hero ......pero costara un alma humana 
Ofrezco a bubbly 
Too late, I eated it 💀. . Sorry bubbly
A pin
I think you're becoming Mari.. . It's an incredibly powerful disease and it wouldn't take long for you to fully become Mari and worship Hero for life and there's no treatment for this.. . I'm sorry but enjoy becoming a Hero worshipper for life.
There’s also a deadly side affect of the disease which makes traversing stairs very dangerous

Dude this made me laugh for the first time in a while holy shit

i am and it.does the same thing
Pursuit Hero?
Nah,it's not just you,Henry is a Handsome Fella.
he genuinely is. he's like very handsome to me. he also just has a beautiful personality and that just really adds to it. i like his silly messy hair and stupid little smile. he's beautiful 
I mean I get why you'd like him, he's hot, he's responsible, he's on his way to becoming a doctor, >!he's single with ~~a dead~~ no girlfriend!<, he likes kids (probably) He is pretty attractive ngl 
FINALLY COME ON JOIN THE CLUB WOOOOOOHOOOO
I need him so bad I think about him every single day and I’m not even kidding
me fr
hes so hot. i want him to be my wife 

seb,Sebastian ,,!Sebastian solace   fish guy fish  😅😅😅🐟🐟fisj. Sebastisn 🐟💙💙💙💕

Even in the Omori subreddit I cant escape him...
Agreed. I don't even usually like men that much-. My lad is just made different.
he's cute!!! he can cook, he's seems very kind and caring, just a great guy! hero 10/10 because. because he. he- because he
Damn your right. . 
Yes
HE IS

I idolize this fukr
Eh…
My bf looks kinda like white hero so I’ve secretly dubbed him the nickname hero
r/redditsniper
"Hey there, handsome. Or do you prefer, what's cookin', good lookin'? "
You didn't realize?
But like he IS
Dammit. We're both infected

Of course he is. He is Hero after all
Me with all of them:
As a gay i can promise you hero is very attractive
I mean he IS canonically attractive.. 😁
Tbh real
yeah hes a hottie tbh
Hero deserves more love tbh
Ive always love him, mmrmnsmnske bark bark
r/redditsniper . . Anyways I agree
Hero fr one of the first characters that made question my sexuality, he hot af
HE IS SO HANDSOMEEEEE. Ah, he’s so breathtaking 😭💕
To me,  he looks like Tadashi from Big Hero 6 who I had a crush on, and can confirm; he be a cutie🥰
Honestly, I’ve seen too much of him in general and from my friends that I think I’m just burnt out with him- part of me just don’t like him no more 😭
I think his charm is working on you, but I get what you mean 🤭🤭
 of course he is, he's fucking hero
WHY HE HAVE NO SOCKS
Proof that heroes dont wear capes
True goat,legend,hero of all time. . 
Who's gonna help my man Hero win
so close! that would be Hero
>!"The incident"!< was the climax of the fourth chapter.  It completely changed the direction of the story and shocked everyone!. . John Omori and his best friend Elena (the girl with the rolling pin, on the first picture) were about to confess their love for one another when disaster struck. A mysterious opponent of our lovable group of goofballs had kidnapped two of their friends! In a race against time John and Elena rushed to save them.. . Omori and Elena managed to save the lives of their friends but their unofficial mentor Hero was trapped in a deep coma, due to the kidnapping! Devastated by his failure to protect the people who make his life worth living, John Omori falls back into his depression. All the progress and healing he made, seemingly swept away. . . *The incident functions as a low point for the well-being of our protagonist and the story.  But John Omori and his friends will rise again. They deserve to be happy!*
I will keep my lips shut on how accurate you are
Maybe I should have marked this post with a spoiler warning haha :3
Honestly I haven’t received backlash on my art. Only backlash I received was people harassing me over how I drew Hero in feminine clothing. Only thing I was talking about were artists getting unnecessary criticism on their art posts. You didn’t say anything wrong.
Hero's sick of their shit

No guys, you’ve got it all wrong.. . hero is just a femboy.
maybe..
Hero’s secretly trans

Yes.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
That is amazing maybe it’s the power of feminine Hero
Shes really nice and have amazing drawings. And are funny too. But very obsessed with hero (to put it lightly). Go follow her👺👺👺
yo i recognize that maid hero image for retro gamer
i vote myself because im the only person i can think of who posts a ton of hero on here. Everyone who posts about hero omori frequently is awesome. /silly
Hmmm... considering you're the most popular candidate so far... wouldn't this count as voter fraud? /j. . 
Nope this is actually hero omori voting on spinnileafs account trust
i believe it. hi hero omori!!!!. . 
Hell yeah 😎
The Hero guy (You know EXACTLY who this is about)
everyone loves spinnileaf!!! . . 
Uhhh hero is still deciding what he’s gonna choose give him a minute. . 
ok ill wait. . 
Spinnileaf! . . It’s nice seeing Hero so loved and appreciated, I feel like he’s severely underrated in comparison to everyone else.
Ain’t even a question, Spinnileaf. Their Hero collection is one for history
I’m quite new to Reddit buttttt spinnileafs hero collection is rlly cool and I kind of want to see how big it gets soooo yeah :). . I love Islaamnogood’s positivity too ;) they’re great!
either spinnileaf or islaamNogood spinnileaf for supplying me with Hero content but islaamnogood for overall content and news as they informed bout Hero being in chapter 10
Spinnileaf and stitchbitch0212.. . Now, could someone tell me the username of that person which came before spinnileaf that also made all the hero art (specifically femboy hooters (?) hero) I know they deleted their account but I've been racking my brain for a few months now.
Idk the username... but... here you go I guess....?. . 
i think thats tamatona3 😭😭😭
its the person with a huge shrine of hero omori . . 
Why...Why would someone have a huge shrine of Hero (Omori)?

Oh this picture is so old!!! Its grown so much sinec then...🥰🥰
Roses are red, violets are blue, Spinnileaf REALLY loves Hero and there's nothing I can do.
Wow...Yeah, okay, that really is a lot of Heros. . Guess the day will finally be saved with all of those around.
I really dunno, the only one I can remember by name in this subreddit is spinnileaf, but only because of the hero obsession thing that user has. . Edit: also If i see a room full of hero memorabilia i literally dont need to know who the user is I'm just like "oh it's the hero guy, uhhh what's their name.... ah right, spinnileaf, whelp I see no problem here"
poll closed sorry :(. . you can see the winners here :P. . [
This is amazing, but Hero's vocals don't really match him.
wow hero sounds really old
Battle Against a True Hero
Hero 100%. Just like me fr
Hero wins it almost solely because of OK Computer
hero getting aux just cause of ok computer
obviously (based) hero
Hero, you gave him like 2 of my favorite albums.
Either Aubrey or Hero.. . Most likely Hero.
Hero 100%
Hero is a fellow prog rock enjoyer, so him
Give the aux to Hero fr.
Hero, I don't mind Crimson King, and most of the other stuff on ANY of the characters lists at all tbh. I just LOVE Ride the Lightning too much to give it to anyone else.
hero. I love king crimson too much
I'd give it to Hero
WITH THE HERO PAJAMAS AS WELL????. . Are you just Hero irl?
OOOO FIRE!! I love the hero things on ur keyboard lol. I only learned half of duet and half of by your side and the first page ish I kinda forgot it now of worlds end valentine lmao so respect!!
I'ma play the game later and see (I've already watched a playthrough from Manlybadasshero in 2020 December)
Nice, I love that guy's content
Hero wouldn't be phone guy. . . He'd be Henry MILLER
Haha, you see though, >!the actual important detail of the video is that Hero is actually the phone guy they're fighting. If you remember how phone guys are made in DSAF you'd remember that they have their memories wiped and are told to run the pizzaria, so that's why everyone else is fighting him. And why he doesn't know anything about this ''Henry''. !<It's terrible and uncool I know, but that's technically what's supposed to be happening...
If hero was 170 cm at 15 i doubt he would be a giant 190 cm at 19.. . By 15 i feel he would be closer to his full height.. . I see no validity behind the height. . Hero is 170 cm at 15 yeah but we have nothing to really compare it to
I mean fr Hero is almost 2 metres tall in this chart, seems a little ridiculous🧎‍♂️
The way they're framed in the in-game art makes them feel very small and meek compared to their environments, where DW Hero looks quite tall compared to the younger kids, so them all being the same height is really strange.
HERO IS 6'4???. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . GOD DAMN
I like real world hero's pose
That makes sense! For simplicity's sake I just assumed every character (except for Hero) had hair that lay flat on the tops of their heads, but I think things like hair and shoe soles could definitely be inflating it.
Actually papa chip is alive you can find him in the Hero club
That's nefarious chip. . or he is actually findable IDK
"Go forth Hero! Be the  you were meant to be!"
for those wondering, you can find a complete list of NPCs with a reward [on the wiki here]()! most of them just give you healing items or toys, but some have unique equipment.
You also get a discount at shops if you use Hero.
I didn’t know about this, I should try this out!. . Thank you for sharing this.
Yeah! I didn't notice it until I used Hero to separate my Hikkiko playthrough from my true one in the save screen. Fake Hero did a lot of good to a lot of people.
Probably Sunny admires Hero
Hero likes being a part-time hero
99 leeks is the cost sir for your flower garlyn
THE FACT HERO SAID HE WASNT GOOD AT DRAWING
use hero as a support to heal the others
I kinda want to see at least one for Hero, so I'm gonna do Tenderize for fun.. . . Tenderize (4 × atk - def). . . Miserable Snaley 1 (4 def) w/ 0 Juice. 63 base Attack, with Mush (+1), Cookie (+10), Tenderizer (+30), Red Ribbon @ 10 Energy (+21).. Enraged (×1.5), Release Energy (×1.25) and Sno-Cone (×1.2), we get 281.25 Attack.. . . With Tier 3 emotional advantage, crit, and max damage variance, we end up with. . . dmg = (281.25 × 4 - 4) × 2.5 × 1.2 × 1.5 + 2 = 5046.5,. rounding to 5047 damage.. . . Quite humble compared to the rest of the board, but gotta give props to Hero trying his best to deliver a real good - albeit slightly intense - massage.. . . EDIT: Wait, I didn't quite understand that part - if you paid the Toll Gators to skip the construction site, do you still get to fight Snaley on Omori Route One Day Left? . . . If not, might have to re-calculate this for SXH instead. . . . I'm kinda lazy so I'm just gonna assume Hero can deal up to 5000 damage and leave it at that lol
yes it does. Idk why 21598 didnt, but since that's one of Hero's, I may guess its due to those already being here, but just lacking the white background? 
Just use gun with hero
My party are all level 20 and below, and I beat them first try.  . I just rinsed and repeated the same moves.  . Use confetti to make the party happy when the slime girls become angry  . Once they are happy use lucky slice with omori but until then use stab with sad poem on omori, audrey on counter, kel heals health and juice to omori and hero, and hero always cooks for audrey.  . Then when you get your energy bar to the max, release energy. (I only needed to use it twice)
if anyone is looking at this in 2025, get omori manic. make them angry ASAP, because they’ll get angrier later. make Hero happy as well, because he’s targeted a lot. Keep mock for omori and you should be good. Get ultimate ability. I was level 26.
There's also Customizable Difficulty mod
This is part of the Shin Omori Tensei mod as well
I love seeing the omori modding community getting some recognition, thank you for making this post!
Aww that sucks :( It really is a shame that Mac can’t handle any of the more major mods.. . P.S. I’m trying a new one called Hero’s Fever Dream and when I load in it shows me this:. . Failed to load: img/system/headcanon.png. . Any clue how to fix that or should I just try my luck with another mod?
Hero as a medic. Others I don’t remember much. Sorry.
Did you put the Contract you got from Jawsum on Hero? It greatly reduces the health and Juice of the party member holding it. Take that off and put something else on.
YES OMG U SAVED ME😭
Glad I could help
Contract on Hero is wild 
POV: forgot contract existed
Indeed
If you make the roots sad, they can’t attack or heal, and just do nothing every turn.
Do you get an achievement for actually fighting him?
nope. you only get an achievement for the anvil.
Bro I don’t have hack away wind up throw or snack time💀💀
u can make the roots sad and use cook and life jams
I'm late but do you NEED to fight this thing to progress the story?
I'm not sure I'm stuck at the generator part and idk if I have to beat king carnivore to continue the story. If you found anything out could you please help me?
You don't, one of the ladders lead to a plug
Ok thanks for helping me
Did you end up finishing the game
Not yet, I'm getting there tho
Also the outstanding visual style award is pretty contested with Loop Hero, Inscryption, Forza...
Adding on!!!. . HERO: After beating Mr. Jawsum, go to the first floor and the top right for the Club Sandwhich.   Talk to MR. SCAREBRO and have Hero punch him two times. He'll gain 20 attack! :D
I think it would be worthy to mention emotional healing. From my muscle memory it seems like different emotions advantage (I will take Happy Hero vs Angry friends) grant different healing numbers (Only works with Hero), it is great to memorize emotional healing early game but in later game or mods such as Painful BR, Pizza and Large Chicken would be more viable due to diversed speed from each enemies, making mid-turns healing mandatory  to tank the whole attacks.
Hero is probably getting violated in said case 😭
True, Mari seems to be the one wearing the pants in her relationship with Hero
"Hero will save us all.". . "Hero will free us all.". . "You should be smiling, too.". . "Aren't you excited? ". . "Aren't you happy? ". . "...". . "You are going to be free.". . . . (Despite everything, You still smile.)
Absolute literature
I liked it, i just wish hero wasn't written to immediately choose violence when omori got triggered
I heavily doubt you could get through her with just Hero's healing skills, considering how slow he is and how hard she hit
This is so cool! I love Hero's miserable expression, instead of giving a large frown like Kel or Aubrey, you opted for a more dead, cold and emotionless stare, very fitting for Hero. Great work! 
Me when I see manic hero:. . 
Manic Arby:. .

We got bedsy so not that bad. They trolling vs the sabers tonight tho
Lol I'm a sabres fan. God forgot about us Buffalonian hockey fans long ago.
I’ll try to apply- do you guys let people know if they’re rejected, or is there just no response?
We will let you know and stuff
Hello! Im in you guys’s discord server, and I just wanna say keep up the good work!! The mod looks great so far, I have Omori in console so I won’t be able to play but I will most certainly watch a playthrough on YouTube or something :) I could try to apply and all but I don’t think my art would be up to standard for this sort of stuff, and i haven’t really tried drawing in the omori artstyle much so ill think about it. Thank you for putting your time and effort into this mod and im looking forward to it coming out!!
It's very good to see an Omori mod rising and if I could've helped I would but I'm kinda ass at writing (idk what's programming even about)
YIPPE I'M GLAD TO BE PART OF IT WOW9W9W
Hero wearing pyjamas is both ironic and hilarious
I feel like Omori's is the most pyjama-like one apart from Hero
yo wyd turbulent coffee
uknow i didnt know hero could be a tank until 3 minutes ago
All he needs is a good charm… but I feel lied to
Honestly looks pretty edible, not as edible as Hero though.
im so glad its rw this year😭😭shaking in excitement for heros
It was his birthday like one month ago chill out! 
This is spinnileaf, they'd make everyday Hero's birthday
Fair point
YES 
>>!Hero loved her and you killed her.!<  . >  . >>!You loved her and you killed her.!<
Yeah fuck you too, I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep
Man I feel sorry for Hero, what he went through is so fucked up
and im going to steal heros heart
he lost that a long time ago 

It brokey brokey
Not if i steal it first
It’s already gone 
We can fix him
Oh 
Hero
Who’s Hero? I think you mean Henry
MODS
You can’t hide from the truth
DEATH OF THE AUTHOR
u/mods

I believe that Hero's jacket was used by Mari in the first picture because it is very cold at the seashore at night.. . Hero is such a gentleman!
I think Hero's handwriting would be progressively less and less understable cuz he's going to be doctor
he would write his name like this: ~
Instant soup noodle.... . This (ra)man became the very thing he swore to stay away from. Zaymn
Tilde
Hero is the kind of guy to pick arial instead of calibry in Microsoft Word
Hero is going to school to become a doctor, you know that guy doesn't have good handwriting lol
That's only because the things Doctor's write on are SUPER important and is SUPER bad if it gets forged.
Hero's a medicine student, I'm sure his writing would be a little less comprehensive lul
Hero is studying to become a doctor, i would expect not to be able to read his name 
They teach you bad handwriting in med school.
no, hero would be like \~\~\~\~
Nah, Hero’s going to school to become a doctor, so his handwriting has to be a bunch of barely legible squiggles.
I feel like hero would be more practical and very professional 
Hero writes like a scribe from the medieval times
Hero is a med study so I would expect his handwriting to be unreadable but I like this
Nah Hero's handwriting would be nearly unreadable because he's studying to become a doctor
HERO SUPREMECY
A sad day for younger brothers alliance
And Hero is still taller than me by a literal single centimeter 
Huh, maybe it really is possible for Hero to have had such a growth spurt then. I based what I wrote on my own experience, which would definitely be totally different from the US one since I live in central Europe and some statistics about growth by age (cant link it since im on mobile, but you can Google it and it will easily pop out).. Its probably all about gene pools and all and given how diverse and large USA is that growth spurt definitely could happen in Hero's case
Yeah, I live in the northeast US and judging by dialect choices (Hero sandwiches, soda instead of pop) that's probably the general area where Omori takes place. Our boys grow like weeds lmao, I genuinely can't think of anyone I know who'd be shorter than Sunny and Basil here.
>DW HERO - 5'6. . Actually, Hero is stated ingame to be 5'7(which is 170.18cm)
Ah, thank you very much! I’ll be changing that right now!
how did hero grow so much in three years
I’d say 15-18/19 are the most crucial when it comes to growth, I lost a ton of weight and grew pretty tall through my sophomore/junior year of high school
Cap I didn't grew at all since I was 15 I was 5'6 since I was 14 💀💀
Wait until 16. . . It happens.
I'm 17 1/2
Rip.
rip indeed
I'm literally the reverse of you, until 15 I didn't grow, at all.. . But then suddenly something overcame me and I grew like 30 cm in two years.
Damn
Wait one more week
???
I've grown maybe an inch since turning 15, and I'm nearly an adult now
Wasnt hs hero 162 or smth
I checked and youre right, sorry
Dammit I thought I would be taller than all of them(except hero)
Heros my height, cool
I'm taller than hs hero. Hs hero is 15 and I'm 13
Dang real world hero is tall
hero is 6'4!!!!???!?!?!?!?
And Mari trying to do Hero.. . Damn, Sunny has really weird fantasies starring Hero.
Hopefully Hero doesn't have the same fate... 





Awww yisss afterlife snuggles
>!oooooooh an AU where hero dies instead of Mari!!<
Oh boy. Now who put Hero and Mari into the blender.
Close your mouth
Good bot . . Le pat pat

OH GON PLEASE NO
happy cake day 
Hero is not dead, I'm still waiting for the sequel 
superhero kel
That was his mistake!
I don’t know what that is, can someone explain?
THE MAIN CHARACTERS OLDER SIBLING ALREADY DIED
broken space moment

Ironic, considering his name is Hero
Except hero lives right??..RIGHT?!
Tadashi from the movie Big Hero 6.
hero is basically if tadashi got a tan and styled his hair differently
Nonono. His Brother is named Hero
I've always seen Hero and Gary Oak
Hero:     :*(
>!Pov: Hero!<
Did ya just NTR Hero/Henry lol
Heroposting
That sucks, I'm so sorry. That happened with my Hero plush (literally 3 days after my mum gifted it for me)
Saw the image and title, jokingly said "who are you, spinnileaf?" Then opened the post and saw it was, in fact, spinnileaf
My exact thoughts when I saw this post.
"Baking my long distance partner into a cookie because I miss him"
Oof that's quite a distance
HERO NOOOOOO HOW COULD YOU EAT HIM???

Yummy
😋
. . Tasty
Well deserved
"Anyone got some ibuprofen, I got a headache"
scrumptious
oh my god i need those
I was about to call spinnileaf for this..
Same! 😂 Once, I mentioned spinnileaf on a hero post and then realized that the OP was, in fact, spinnileaf.
Dude, your Heroism has driven you to do some pretty neat things. They look yummy! 😋
Is that custom made cookies maker?!
same energy as "baking my long distance bf into a cookie because I miss him" or smth along the lines
Your obsession feeds your talent and honestly I admire it
Just checked the OP's bio... yea u weren't kidding...
on that hikicookiemori shit
Hero in the last pic: “Do you have any ibuprofen? I got a headache”
You should put frosting on them.
Knew who it was before the image even loaded 😭😭😭
She’s so iconic ngl
“Spinnileaf? Yep. Spinnileaf.”
Can one spinnileaf last their entire life eating only Hero Cookies??? lol
I need... Cookie cutters of ALL of them
I'm so happy this exists
wait how to do this???
heroic
Reminds me of that guy who chews on their Hero picture when they're upset
That was also me🥰
i need that
Hero would be so proud. He would definitely pair these with his hero sandwich.
WHERE DID YOU GET THESE FROM?? 😭😭😭
Yooo how’d they make that cookie cutter?
So is your friend starting and business or what cause I want to buy that so bad
“I made hero cookies”. . Well did he like them? (this is a joke)
better the jotaro pancake!!!
Love this 
Oo nice
I'm so jealous
I will eat them all
share the dough recipe pleaseeee
🙊🙊🙊❤️
To be fair I don't think anyone would like a game based after the traumatic parts of their life soooo
I would
I would if I was the 'director' or smth of it
I would love that
I would like to introduce you to a game called The Binding of Isaac lol
Well, i personally wouldn't like a game which premise is : "here is your friends' and your personal trauma regarding the death of your other friend, look at it" neither, so pretty reasonable xd
True like I wouldn't like that on a game
There's a lot of reasons for why Hero wouldn't like Omori. Especially because it revolves around the death of his girlfriend & Sunny makes him look like a wimp in the dreamworld, who's also pro capitalist.
Da comrade, Hero is a proud patriot of the soviet onion
&#x200B;. . 
DW Hero isn't just pro capitalist, man's a raging capitalist when he gets the opportunity to be
Like the Once-ler….
how ba-a-a-ad can i be
: HOW BAD CAN I POSSIBLY BE?! LET’S SEE!!!
To be fair, I wouldn’t want to see my friend >!stab himself in his head!<

It's M for crude humour, not violence. Hero will be fine. . 
where i live it's rated 18 for gambling and that one "i fucking love air conditioning" line from humpfrey
Geez imagine Hero playing through the spider bits

he definitely wouldnt like it, it literally ilistrates his trama lul
I think Hero would dislike OMORI for some other reason…
Good thing too, because they wouldn't sell a 17+ game to 16 year olds.
Nervously glances my favorites tab on steam
Can someone explain to me wth this game is? I keep getting this on my fyp and looked it up and cant really make sense of anything related to it. It said it was a phycological horror novel or something but im very confused what this is and why my reddit is showing me it
 the omor is calling you
???
I wouldn’t expect him to play a game about a depressing experience in his life anyways
Hero loading a pistol 
I'm a healer, but..
Which version of Hero specifically?
Real World Hero 
THE LITTLE HERO😭😭😭😭
You have competition, u/spinnileaf. Do what you must.
I immediately though of spinnileaf the moment I saw the hero plush in her bag, I think my brainrot's terminal
The baby hero in her baggy omg
That’s not a hero plushie he’s just very small
I thought Hero wouldn’t be sold out for like an hour
Hero fans are far more obsessed than the rest of you
Fax. Hero stans are crazy obsessed in comparison to stans of the other characters. I once saw one Hero stan hate on the Pursuit AU for “ruining his character”, and then they shipped Hero/Sunny and tried to defend the age gap with “it’s fictional”. Pick a side, man.
YES WE ARE
hero has more loyal fans than aubrey
Ngl, shocked it's her and not Hero
Same he’s so underrated
ngl i can never tell if that's just a thing this subreddit made up because i see hero fans constantly 
Always thought of him was the character everyone liked but not exactly as a favourite, guess I was wrong lol.
I Never See hero fans for some reason, maybe they’re hiding 
You can see lots of fanarts of Sunny(Omori), Aubrey, Kel and Basil post good ending hanging out and Hero is kinda forgotten asside of him reacting at the truth.
Really? I almost never see fellow Hero fans
Sweetheart in shambles at all these Hero fans
🥲i managed to get Mari but had to leave Hero out since I couldnt afford an order over $100usd
Hero body pillow when
Alright fine, a Hero one should suffice
Hero985
Hero
That one image of femboy hero framed 
Oh no.. . **Pursuit Hero**
We don’t talk about Pursuit Hero. Hell, we should never speak of pursuit.
What is that about? I've never heard about it
Go onto google and type in pursuit hero ao3, it'll be there
Hero, out of vengeance, want to find Sunny (after he moved out of town) and murder him.That sentence alone is horrible, and there are people fetishizing Hero in this AU and the murderer/victim relationship between Hero and Sunny. . . It's the worst thing in Omori fandom, other Omori fans absolutely hate this AU (if they heard of it) for obvious reason. This AU is against anything OMOCAT trying to convey in the game, and fetishizing/smut (I guess, I never actively search out this AU) of Pursuit is worse than any porn fanart (imo). . Edit: this post is wrong, correct explanation is the comment under.
That’s not even close to right, Pursuit Au is a sequel to You’re Back, Mari, where Hero hallucinates Mari and believes that she came back to tell him to protect Sunny at any cost. Sunny is adopted by Hero’s parents, making them adoptive brothers. In Pursuit, Hero kidnaps Sunny in order to try and protect him from everything that could possibly hurt him. Sunny calls Hero ‘Big Brother’. Don’t try and explain what it is without having even looked at it. It’s a well written and interesting au that has reasonable development for the mischaracterisation.
Hmm... Whoever told me that piece of information must be on drug, then.. . I normally find that kind of content uncomfortable, so I didn't search it... Sorry about that.
Idk I think Pursuit nuclear ending is peak though un ironically
hero is okay with this being a Wendy’s.
Wendy is Webdys
Wendy is Webdys
Leave your window open tonight 🙏

Now I can tell where you live 
tbf some people can pin point atleast the city with just the outside of the house (facade and windows basically can be enough) depending on if you see something else like maybe some trees they can just find your damn house. . personally I'm not really worried about a rando finding me because of a random pic of my window from outside but it's still crazy that it's possible
Take a picture of your enemy's window say it's yours and see the magic
What have you done 
Looks like you're butt naked, screaming at god
dfsh
relatable
Makes me think of the scene from home alone when Kevin had the cardboard cut outs!

this hero obsession is actually straight up unhealthy, have you tried seeing a psychiatrist?

Peak autism moment
Did you hear the [Picnic Healing Sound]() every time you bite it?

What no new games or content do to a fandom. (I know there will never be new official content becuase there is no need). . Plus every fan game went under from what I've seen, or they are brushed aside.

Oh okay
Nevermind, I made it.
[Trans Hero](). . Here it is!
Gigachad Hero 
She SO comments on how other girls look just to prank Hero every once in a while
They appear to have an ofrenda, which is a thing in Mexican culture. Also I like the idea that Hero is a golden boy Mexican, because that's rare and it gives me someone to relate to more
I'm an only child so it's me lol
I mean he is Hero's brother, and Hero was culinarily savvy.

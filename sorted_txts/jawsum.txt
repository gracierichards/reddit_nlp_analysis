fact: 90% of gambling addicts quit right before they're about to hit big
...... . ..... . nice try gambling-machine!. . but i wont fall for that again again again!
*falls for it again anyways*
it'll work this time trust me
I actually got the biggest jackpot in my first playthrough and ended up not having to worry about clams again 😭
What number even is it
I forget tbh but I think it was like...100,000? Maybe more idk exactly
funny becuse i always hit big on that
yeah the slot machines are incredibly profitable, i used them to get a million clams once in order to see what would happen at that slime girls scene
What did happen? Did they take your money?
I still have 100 gambling memes from DPO. . . . 
Clams, clams, clams
I'm gonna step on the clams
Tonight, I'll stonks
And be a big winner
Flair checks out
Ah, gambling addiction :)
You can go in debt?
Clams are worthles, it all about calms now 😎

Keep chasing your losses, they can’t run forever.
Save. Gamble . Lose. Reset. Repeat
gambling in omori is like the most efficient way of making money tho lol . . i remember i set up a macro an went to sleep
in the wise words of barry, "come on, big  money, big  money!"
I saved in the elevator and then for the next 20 minutes i gambled, i got 200k clams and saved there, i was the best gambler of all time
Just pull a katana zero and do a little rewinding
"No, that won't work"
I'm pretty sure you're statistically meant to win, I watched my friend win like 100k when he was doing his playthrough
This being the third biggest post this year is beautiful
i lost so many clams in that casino...
So true
Inflatable costume jawsome my beloved
I internally screamed when I saw Jawsum's costume, he's my favorite character. Unfortunately I am from Latin America and will probably never be able to buy merch because I am poor lmao.
i love the capitalist shark so much it's unreal
do you have more pictures of jawsum cosplayers
That Jawsum cosplay has stolen my heart.
It was actually an official costume the staff members put on
MR JAWSUM IS REAL
Jawsum poster in last resort
I thought that was meant to be when he became the owner of the last resort?
Maybe its that. I don't exactly remember but the poster said 199X
Necro answer:. . At least not until Omori's alone when Jawsome scooped up all his friends to work for him.
oh no mr jawsum 
You could say he is... "The apex predator" :v ......yeah that was horrible
actually it made me giggle 
r/angryupvote
Idc I'll do it. . r/TDXRoblox. . 
It's all canon, since Hero and Jawsum stuff exists
The fact that the image besides it is just Jawsum with Hero 
NO WAY DESERT SAND FEELS WARM AT NIGHT I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE
I THOUGHT I WAS TOO

❤️
No. Jawsum is nothing like that person. Fuck that guy.

Mr Jawsum. He had some fun moments, but he was mostly just there as a way to fill out more of the final act.
Yk it might be worth making a voting thing instead of reading through over 300 comments… also remove Jawsum
With that said. Get Jawsum outta here.

Bruh gg
Mr jawsome
Mr Jawsum
naw try again
Gator guy
nah he a little later
Mr Jawsum
They typed in mr jawsum on the internet
Oh god no
That was an epic description. Though at least they get to have the entire Orange Oasis. Mikal just gets what a job with Mr. Jawsum to serve for eternity?
Bro he doesn’t even get that he’s left out of the Jawsum segment. He’s one of the few play grounders who just don’t appear there.
That is sad. Makes me want to play it again just to look around to try and find all the playground people.
From the [OMORI Wiki]():. . >Unused dialogue from the game's files suggests that he was originally meant to appear at the casino's construction site.
Maybe when Omori 2 if that becomes a thing he will appear there.
Mr. Jawsum is a fucking chad

Leaked footage of Mr Jawsum’s vacation
Mr. Jawsum after exploiting childrens and forcing them to work 24/24 without any salary.
He told Mr Jawsum he was 15 before >!he took over the Boss’ position!< so technically not yet  It’s screwed up regardless tho
live mr jawsum reaction
Mr Jawsum 
Jawsum. I think he’s very cool, I love the Power-Hungry Capitalist trope in fiction, but in real I’d hate him
I absolutely love Mr. Jawsum but if I met him IRL I would commit a hate crime
Anti-Capitalist Hate Crime 
nah he seems like a fun uncle
Jawsome
Pretty sure they were confirmed to be around 30 USD on a stream (or so I've heard) but if I had to guess not knowing that, I'd assume my soul, left leg, and my firstborn.. . . . I'm willing to pay that price too if they released a Jawsum one. I will put it in a jar.
3rd one because of mr jawsum yknow
He ate jawsum.
hehe silly
judge us all? oh man, i sure don't hope she sees my comment suggesting to release the jawsum body pillow cover... that would be terrible...
 rip jawsum
I’ll avenge you, Mr Jawsume! 
jawsum will live in our hearts forever 😭
FIRST THEY GO AFTER JAWSUM, NOW THEYRE OUT FOR THE SON HE NEVER HAD
I mean in their defense jawsums boss was annoying to beat the first time I fought him
KİLL BASİL KİLL BASİL. . 
KILL KILL KILL KILL
He didn't earn a single penny it was all from his inheritance from Mr. Jawsum
A single penny, that's what he didn't do, all his money comes inherited for Mr Jawsum
We can’t get that before jawsum flair. Jawsum first!
Jawsum fight
and the shark on some of the cards is literally the reason Jawsum is one
I like how Mr. Jawsum's arc/fight was concluded with him fucking off for a vacation, based.
If you use OMORI Console, you can also do solos by removing the characters you aren’t using. For soloing as characters who aren’t Omori or Sunny, you need to use Revivable Omori, possibly No Second Chances, and Actual Turn Order. The first two are so that the game doesn’t crash when entering battle, and the last makes it so that selecting Fight works properly instead of skipping your turn.. . You need to bend rules for the Jawsum fight if you are soloing as anyone besides Omori, because the only way for a solo character to hurt him is to kill a gator guy when there isn’t a second gator guy and immediately using a follow-up to directly attack the boss unguarded. Kel and Aubrey are able to use their follow-ups intended to be used with Omori even if he’s not in the party, but him being toast disables it for whatever reason and the Jawsum fight forces everyone in the party. I settled for reviving Omori when the elusive opportunity to actually kill a gator guy and follow-up on Jawsum presents itself and then using the console to kill Omori again.. . Since Hero’s follow-up for Omori requires him in the party for it to function properly and Sunny has no follow-ups, I decided to outright skip Jawsum for both of them. For Sunny, I spawned Pluto (Expanded) since the scripted fight forces Omori and the Dream Friends in the party.
Did anyone just... leave? I literally walked them out of the resort and didn't fight Jawsome. What happens in that case?
Why not completely ban items? Flex + Dynamite is quite strong early in the game and dynamite spam beats Jawsum 100% of the time in 2 turns if you grind clams at the slot machines for long enough to buy 8 from the gooman outside the entrance.
nah, mr jawsum is definitely lust

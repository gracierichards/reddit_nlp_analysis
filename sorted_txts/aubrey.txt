i want to know if i can skip him until max lvl then come back to take my revenge from previous saves.. . i want to think he stops attacking when he expects you to revive the others , so having the last one not revived could ensure to kill him (at least aubrey does massive damage if she lands a critical)
He has infinite HP. Bro is immortal
He can’t die, he’s literally **made of life jam**
Use LIFE JAM!. It really works!
Sorry Aubrey the omori dystopia shirt stays on during sex
idk if an event happens where hes separated from aubrey, he might realize how much he cares about her. sometimes constant banter can lead to closer relationships cause youre interacting with a person way more.
That’s fair, I think there were a few events but I guess it’s just me personally because I didn’t really sense the attraction between them? It’s cute tho don’t get me wrong I just didn’t see it
Aubreyblushing(100x)
Flustered Aubrey Is So Cute Omfg
i'd hug aubrey
Why is aubrey blushing. . . Like, because of WHO

Aubrey actually has the body pillow that you find before this fight, i love the detail in this.

 (Aubrey is counter spamming again dam it COOK FASTER) oh hey omori you want a snack?. .  U gud bro
AUBREY threw a stone at the LAKE!. . LAKE took 1 damage!. . AUBREY: Take that you fucking lake.
LAKE pulls AUBREY into the water!. . AUBREY became ENRAGED and CONFUSED!. . LAKE : Take that you fucking human girl.
I swear that lake's out to get everyone.

Aubyinium Plasma is made in a MAX Voltage Advanced Fusion Reactor in order to turn it. Into Aubyinium Fluid. . You need to put it in a Vacuum freezer at Voltage. . After that mix it in with liquid oxygen and Hydrochloric Acid to get Aubychloric Hydroxide (it still a acid) . . once your done you chemical dehydrate it at a UXV chemical dehydrator. to get Aubyinium Fine Powder (Chlorine, Hydrogen, and Oxygen returns to being a gas). . After that you can either mix in Gold, Platinum, and Indium to make a Superconductor called MariTech SuperConducter for Maritech circuits or you can put it in a EBF with Infinity coils to finnaly get Aubyinium Ingot
Wow i love this community
Nice 
Imagine taking the game's artstyle and making It better.
>!Are you love me yet,Aubrey?<!
I got the feeling Aubrey kinda knew the whole time
how
Aubrey comin in hot for revenge though-
I think Aubrey is trying to hold Hero back.. She failing,of course,but its the thought that counts.
WHY POLLY WHY NOT AUBREY oh wait I’m assuming most people on this fandom are 49 year old men and they need justification for their simpin
Aubrey: *Walks to the park*. Sunny: *Randomly gets out of a dumpster with a knife* AUBREY-CHAN
Hero aids aubrey in the battle and unleash a bunch of heat actions
Perfect
Oh, and this frame of Anime Aubrey is beautiful, thank you.
Aubrey best girl is now Aubrey best waifu
*NOOO AUBREY IN HD I CANT DO IT NOOO-*
Anime Aubrey is the new religion
And Susie and Aubrey just have a competition on who can hit a baseball farther.
I get the overlap between the fandoms. . tell me Aubrey and susir wouldn't be best friends
probably not
Aubrey: "Excuse me, what the hell is this?". . McDonald's employee: "A kids toy?". . Aubrey: "IT'S A GIRLS TOY". . Basil: "Aubrey, it's fine, I like the pink jump rope". . Aubrey: "No! It's about principles! I'm not going to let . them get away with this!". . Employee: "Huh? Are you threatening me? I'm not scared of you.". . Aubrey: "If I were you, I'd be scared of him. >!You're the one who made the mistake of giving him a jump rope!!<"
My employee: “I’m not scared of you”. Aubrey with a bat that has giant nails in it: “I’m about to end this mans whole career”
Oh. Oh no.
" I dont fear you!". "Then you will die braver than most."
I feel like an Aubrey in these kinds of situations. “Hey uh this is like not okey dokey. Fix it”
I need someone like this. So many things have gone wrong in my life cuz I've been too scared to correct someone.
Spoiler tag(real world aubrey)
you don't have to spoiler tag characters real-world appearances anymore
my bad, i didnt see the update
sunny having a crush on aubrey when he was younger is canon. aubrey reciprocating his feelings isnt
Well i disagree with you!
What did he say
epic, now watch as i dont downvote you, unlike the reddit hivemimd
At least theyre a good hivemind that seems to be controlled by someone with an actual working brain
oh fuck off
"Disagreed"
IT FEELS LIKE HER YOUNG SELF AGAIN AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THANK YOU
Yep... I based it on that photo of hers smiling whilst eating watermelon
We need more Aubrey art with her younger expressions
It shows, it really captures that feeling. Great job!
the photo of her, the umbrella and the pretty pink jacket  is also awesome
I'll try to draw those too with older Aubrey
For real?! Thank you so much OP
>gambatte:\]
This makes me wanna see an emotion chart of Aubrey with only difference being is she has the same expressions she did as younger.
god ecstatic dream aubrey on hooligan aubrey would be so cursed
Put "I going to going to beat you to death" and it will be the perfect image
That would be cool to try!
Yes, give it a try!
I've always thought of older Aubrey without losing her positivity.
Yeah, me too. I also thought of her without pink hair and green eyes
I love it! is she crying?
Tears of happiness
Nice
ahh the shading here is amazing!! Just like the watermelon photo <3
Man. . This is just amazing
Thank you!
I said it once and I'll say it again, I'd commit war crimes to protect that smile. Great job btw
Going to post my stuff too on my twitter if you guys are interested! @Finhir1
Oh my fucking god don't downvote me but I thought the tears were her pupils and that .. oh Christ i'm literally so fucking sorry I swear forgive me please
Lmaoo
I can't unsee it now
she’s smiling!!!! 🥺
Yes she is, she deserves to smile ❤️
Hopefully she savours this precious moment
Best girl drawing= upvote

I swear the omori fandom is one of the most talented fandoms out there
Aubrey is easily the best character
My god, I never thought I'd get these much upvotes or even any rewards... I'm so thankful to you guys <3
This is literally one of the most precious things on this whole subreddit it deserves it. . Plus its genius with the correlation to the picture in the photo album
Thank u <3
holy frig this is good
SHES SO SWEET LETTING OUT HER EMOTIONS WE ALL WANT THIS!!!
Aubrey deserves all the happiness in the world :D
I thought the tears were her pupils now I can’t I see that

I would punch a baby grizzly bear in front of its parents to protect that smile.
oh fuck my heart fuuuuck man this shit is too fucking good for me
Yes the only emotion I wanna see Aubrey in. Happiness
aw god damn my heart
I shall worship from now on
Always T\\T I'll protect everyone's smiles someday. Everyone be happy damn it! Bless.

Orange Joe is more importnant

auby!
I wonder if she'll still smile if I tell her the truth.
This is a really great art!. . Upvoted! 
AUBREY is AFRAID!
This is adorable, Aubrey looks so happy with Nekomori!
You look just like younger Aubrey.You matched the style to a t!
Hahah I do notice the resemblance, that's what my brother said too pFt-- anyways thanks!
aaa thanks! The style of the game is really unique, I mainly referenced Aubrey since she's really expressive heheh
Damn this is amazing. Ight I will now make you Aubrey's sister in my head and say it's canon
you know what. imma try to put you as aubrey in fights lmao
pFTT-- But these don't even move lmaoo
thats okay lmao
Hello! xD I drew this three years ago, but I used FireAlpaca using a pencil brush of some sorts. as for how i drew it, i think i referenced dream aubrey's sprites cuz' she looked the closest to me!
Why is pink hair Aubrey considered a spoiler? The twist was already revealed back in 2014.
Just a thought, what happens when Aubrey uses her Mood Wrecker on Sans?
A swing that doesn't miss vs. a person that always dodges. . Obviously the universe explodes
Unstoppable force Vs immovable object, I get it.
More like an Unstoppable Force vs an Uncatchable Entity.
"Aubrey, why do we have to wear these outfits again?". . . "Shut up! The internet will get it!"
Kel: ***galactic THONK***. . …. . “Oh it’s DDLC, right?”. . Aubrey: “Ye.”
Natsuki as Aubrey pretty much accurate
I mean this fight in particular was really just Aubrey wailing on you with a bat while you struggle to defend yourself
Not even. Not in either of her fights does she actually use the bat against you. The most damaging attack she has is just headbutting you.. . You can see in her fights on her turn what she does and the only other thing she does besides headbutting you is spitting in your shoes and 'attacking' which has more so a punching animation than a swinging animation.. . >!I feel that if Aubrey did start using her bat Kel and Sunny would have called the fight as well as the adults in the church for her beating people with a baseball bat. just like Aubrey does what she'd knifed.!<
"AUBREY's weapon of choice. More dangerous than a STEAK KNIFE."
Yeah, and yet no one comments on her using it, despite that. Common sense thus entails it doesn't end up getting used.
I'm sure Aubrey never hits anyone with a bat there (in 3 days left at least, I know there's that quest on one day left). At the end, you can even see in the description that her bat is more dangerous than a steak knife. The bat is more of a threat or to just look intimidating, than the actually used weapon.
Aubrey eats chalk confirmed
When the light is going low
And the shadows start to grow
And the places that you know
Seem like fantasy
There's a light inside your soul
That's still shining in the cold
With the truth
The promise in our hearts
Don't forget
I'm with you in the dark
I think Aubrey is frickin buff and kel is somewhat normal, but even if what you're saying is true Aubrey's nail bat can kill anyone instantly, she just doesn't use it because she's a good person (the weapon description calls it more dangerous than a steak knife)
I mean, if Aubrey loves him in his ideal headspace... 
Fax
These days, I unironically don't trust people who hate any of the game's characters. I've seen people say he's badly-written (disagree), has no screentime (okay fair), annoying (the fuck), drags the group down (I mean, Aubrey just kinda joins you on the last day without doing much of anything to atone for her crimes - and I think Basil suffers so much he makes up for it anyway.) or a psychopath because he decided to hang the corpse and let his friends fall apart. To that last point, I say:. . [. . That aside, I think it's just hypocritical all-around to adore one character and hate another (I say, having hated Aubrey early on in my time in the fandom). It's just like... damn, brother, you have no reading comprehension! That's great to know, I guess.. . I kind of want to venture further into these comments and see people's deranged takes, but I'm too tired and not masochistic enough to do so.
>annoying (the fuck). . This is the go-to word when you dislike a character for no reason. I have seen it EVERYWHERE (although it's usually female characters, for some reason).. . &#x200B;. . And yes I know this comment is 9 months old, if that pisses you off for some reason don't respond
>!Yeah, it makes me wonder are those people literally stupid? "Basil did a lot of bad things!11", well if you can blame a TWELVE year old, then Aubrey is a lot worse since she nearly killed someone whilst being 16... (I do like Aubrey, I was just giving an example)!<
I feel like the fanbase has a tendency to hold the characters to a high standard. obviously, everyone has their own opinions on who was the "worst" after "the incident," but in the end it was mostly trauma response. the characters in omori are fleshed out and imo realistic. their motives for potentially harmful actions have reasons- take aubreys home life for example. much like real life too, people arent perfect, and thats part of what i like about the characters. like hypervexed said, thats the point of the game. they are flawed. it doesnt make sense to pick who was for lack of better words "validated" to react the way they did.
I feel like you're taking this a step further than what the above comment implied. Kel was 100% being antagonizing in some form in every encounter, he always failed to be the bigger person and try to talk Aubrey down. He tries to in the church, but only after accusing Aubrey more, beating around the bush a lot, and then immediately goes back to insulting her.. . It's true he isn't as violent, but he makes it clear he's mad at Aubrey and won't back down. He fails to reconcile with her and to be the bigger person in every encounter. The above comment never implied Aubrey wasn't in the wrong in those encounters either, but Kel was still participating in making things worse.
>he always failed to be the bigger person and try to talk Aubrey down. . The thing is that he tried.. . First encounter: Tried to talk to her and protect Basil, Aubrey didn't explain anything and got violent.. . Second encounter: Tried to talk her into calmly returning the album, Aubrey started bickering with him instead of explaining anything about her and Basil and got violent.. . Third encounter wasn't really about her, it was about the hooligans who didn't even try to prove that they weren't hurting Basil. Guess what, this also got violent!  . . . >he's mad at Aubrey and won't back down. . If you saw your ex-friend bullying your friend who couldn't fight back and refusing to explain why they're doing it, wouldn't you be mad too? Oh, and Aubrey's been quite disrespectful towards Sunny too (called him out about "being in a bubble for 4 years" after his sister died) which further antagonized Kel.  . . . >He fails to reconcile with her and to be the bigger person in every encounter.. . I'll sum it up: If Aubrey could give a shit and at least try to talk to Kel and explain what's happening instead of acting tough and assaulting him and Sunny, all of this could've been avoided. It's not purely Kel's fault, it's mostly Aubrey's fault.
You're completely ignoring my point here. I never stated Kel was mostly in the wrong, in fact I believe it was equal part both him and Aubrey's fault. That's why it's framed similarly to their fights in Headspace when Hero finally comes in to help the two get along. All it took was some calm and collected communication, without any accusation, for them to work things out.. . As for what Kel did, you are being waaay too easy on him. First encounter in the park, he immediately assumes Kim is bullying Basil, and tells her to leave him alone despite the fact that she is walking away and trying to get him to leave her alone. Obviously Basil has a good reason to keep trying to talk to her, but it's clear that Kim wasn't escalating anything with him. Kel however, immediately assumes the worst of Kim, instantly acting hostile. He also assumes Aubrey is messing with Basil when she arrives with the rest of the Hooligans, despite the fact they just showed up. When Aubrey insults Sunny, Kel literally tells Aubrey to "watch it", and he's the first in that encounter to suggest a fight.. . Second encounter at the church, I already explained that he was not calm about asking at all. He literally immediately demands Aubrey give the photo album back in his first words to her there. When Aubrey tells her it's none of his business he actually questions why this time, but then develops it into a personal offense that it should be his business because they all used to be friends, and gets completely off topic. He's also the first to bring up Mari, and while yes Aubrey is a jerk about it, he still brings it up in front of Sunny and uses it as a low blow against Aubrey. When Aubrey explains that she's hurt they weren't there for her when Mari died, Kel actually shows some compassion towards her and tries to explain his point of view, but at the slightest resistance from Aubrey he immediately gets defensive, and preaches to her about how in the wrong she is. When Aubrey expresses that she didn't think she stole the photo album and was saving it, Kel barely questions why and asserts that he won't leave until she gives it back, which is extremely aggressive. Finally after this point he becomes reasonable again and tries to talk to Aubrey calmly, even apologizing and almost breaks through, but when Aubrey wishes to leave (clearly because she needs to process things, but it can be chalked up to Kel being a little tone deaf that he doesn't get that), he makes a huge scene in front of the church, yelling and trying to block her. The making a scene part can probably again be chalked up to Kel making a rash decision, but he still immediately drops trying to talk to Aubrey when she goes to leave, even calling her a thief. If anything this encounter was the one where he acted the worst.. . Third encounter at the lake. Now it's important to preface this one with the fact that Kel had the right to initially think Basil was in danger because of his screaming. The Hooligans were clearly expressing that they only wanted Basil to leave, but Kel clearly didn't hear by the time he and Sunny arrived on scene. However he does immediately verbally attack Aubrey, and when Kim tells him they weren't even doing anything, he instantly doesn't beleive her, and Kel makes no attempt to remove Basil from the area and just leave. After the fight, he immediately states he won't leave, and implies Aubrey has become a horrible person. And yes, she's become a bully and a gang member, but that's not how you stop hostility with someone. He also brings up Mari as a low blow again, and then argues with her right back that she must still care about them, which at first seems noble, but it's a bit of a dick thing to do in front of Aubrey's friends. He also for some reason completely forgets about Basil during this part. When Aubrey actually starts crying and having a mental breakdown, and the rest of the Hooligans have already left, he still isn't deferred from arguing with her.. . I get that Aubrey's a huge jerk throughout all of this and I fully agree, and you can even argue Kel was justified in some of his actions, but the fact of the matter remains that he did very little to diffuse any of these situations. He is just as much as responsible for the fights as Aubrey is.
People don't forgive Sweetheart and yet she had it not that easy at all. Forgiveness is ultimate about ceasing resentment, but that choice is difficult and you don't need to do that, >!you can just jump from a rooftop.!<. . >!Kel didn't attacked Aubrey, she attacked him for wanting to defend his friend from her. The only instances where he did something bad was that he didn't spoke to her as kindly as he should have done, but most of Aubrey's problems in the real world are self inflicted, she alienated her old friends. He however did not try to help them with this after 4 years and so did his friends.!<
EXACTLYYYY. . I don’t hate Aubrey but she was so selfish after the thing happened.
Install the dream Aubrey skin and than play fnf to scare the shit out of her
oh fuck we need to save aubrey
#freeaubrey
RIP Aubrey
The original wallpaper was Aubrey smiling why did it change
Ehhhhhh, not really, this is in the dream world so Aubrey would be way more enthusiastic
Isn’t RW Aubrey the violent one?
*Aubrey turned into a pile of dust*
I missed the Aubrey shirt, and now its sold out ;-;
Same brother same
Irl Aubrey mentions she is concerned about how skinny he is on the swing event, and some other people also mention how skinny he is as well if I remember correctly
As someone who used to be underweight due to just not having an appetite, "skinny" does not mean "gaunt." it just means you look thinner than other people your age.
wait.. THATS WHY people kept offering me fucking endless amounts of food
I am REALLY skinny and I eat an awful lot, like.. I'm 49kg at 16, so yeah, people really ask that
He did, but it's possible he could be home schooled. A lot of my assumption rests on just a few details and other themes honestly, like there was a comment on this sub where someone mentioned the French speaking sprout mole in headspace could hint that he studied French. Which could've happened before he dropped out or after, but still.. . Other details like just the sense his family gave off, strictish father, perfectionist sister, I really got the kind of energy they would take studies pretty seriously. And while it's only up to his mother now, if she not only cleans him up but tries to school him, or set him on the path to study for himself, that's kind of... Thematically consistent with what little we know of his family.. . They definitely don't give a "broken window" vibe like Aubrey and her mother, where she clearly doesn't care what Aubrey does at all, nevermind if she does well in school or anything.. . Basically I'm saying some kind of basic structure for Sunny might still exist.
Aubrey would go from "you look kind of thin" to "holy fucking shit i'm taking you to a hospital"
He slashed Aubrey, not stabbed.
what we needed :)). . a happy punk aubrey
what we need is >!for aubrey to be taken in by kim's family so she can live a better life instead of in an attic with a damaged roof and wall!<
>!with a mom so bloody comatose it’d be absolutely free to sue her for negligence!<
aubrey my beloved
Holy crap this looks so good! I really like your style and use of the follow-up bubble. I do wonder, though, if the misspelling of Aubrey ("Aubery") is intentional.
OH GOD I JUST NOTICED THAT. It was a mistake and I didn’t bother to check the spelling... It’s too late to fix it now but thanks for telling me :,D
Tbf Aubery is a bit of a meme so it works. Just pass it off as intentional lmao. But seriously, really good job on the art!
every aubrey art in this sub is fking good omfg

Hello there Cirno the strongest, you’re here too? I haven’t seen you in a while (yes I’m Cirno fan)
If it weren’t for the title, I wouldn’t be able to tell if this was high-res pixel art or a low-res drawing
all art is pixel art if you are using a computer
Auby
I cant even tell that's pixel art, good job.
That’s not exactly “pixel art,” just low-res
My heart just cannot, this is too much. Auby is just so cutee
🔪

idk man. Should it really be considered pixel art if it's this detailed? Don't get me wrong tho it looks fantastic.
Finally, someone who draws her shoes properly
This doesn't look pixelated at all. It looks like a Neo-Geo graphic which looks far better than a pixelated art. Despite that, I love this especially the colors and the background.
Bros beautiful

I have been unable to sell any of my friends on this game ;-; I just someone to gush over Aubrey with
I like how you made Aubrey smile
and milk instead of orange joe
Oh... Nice eyes you got there. . . . . . * CaN i hAve iT?
here. . 👁. . 🤲🏻
They still have one eye left
Honestly though, very small nitpick that does not hinder my enjoyment of this amazing fanart, if this was Headspace Aubrey she prob would look annoyed at Kel putting his arm around her.
Tall headspace Aubrey is kinda cursed o.O. . Cute tho
Of course, then you check Aubrey's equipment when you have her in your party, and you get this lovely gem of a description.. . AUBREY's weapon of choice.. More dangerous than a STEAK KNIFE.
true, but when you look at aubrey's attacks, she never actually uses the bat. she just headbutts or punches you or spits on your shoe. . (still it is pretty dangerous to carry around)
Use that award money to fix Aubrey’s spleen :/
Oh please Aubrey, don't pretend like ur not holding a f-ing bat with nails in it rn
Meanwhile aubrey with a nailed bat which is obviously more dangerous than a knife:
Aubrey is such a sweet bean. I loved her character. Nice job!
Thank you! And Aubrey too cute, must protect her.
The dream aubrey at least...
Irl Aubrey is still a sweet bean 🔫
Irl Aubrey being a sweet bean when she pushes people into lakes and bullies children and fights in churches
Did you completely miss her redemption arc
Nah she's wonderful and deserves the world for the shit she's been through but she's definitely not a sweet bean. She is sometimes but most of the time that sweet bean is covered in landmines and nails because she puts on a face so often
Real Aubrey too, she just needed her friends back
I love your art! Also Aubrey and Omori is so cute!
I love you both
I think you might want to look at the post again Aubrey
Didn't know Auby was **that** buff
Neither did I.
classic aubrey
NOOOOOOOOOO AUBREY NO
But he beat up Aubrey twice, second time without the knife.
You guys treating it like that poor wall could withstand Aubrey's head lol
. . AUBREY used HEADBUTT
: It didnt even hurt dont worry. . : Aubrey you breaked all the fucking wall
>!Then Kim becomes the new "Aubrey" in the story lol!<
rip aubrey
Wait, shouldn’t there be a spoiler tag on this for the joke and for Aubrey
Aubrey just stares at the parents of the kids like "pathetic"
Don't forget her nailed bat. She doesn't use it but it delivers the message quite well.
Lol, when she was younger she would definitely use that bat.
AUBY BOBA 😱
AUBY BOBA
AUBY BOBA
Where's Aubrey's right hand? 🤨
Behind her bag.
i almost did not realize that was Aubrey, i think it's the hair
Aubrey looks like Nene from Pico’s school
Trans Aubrey  
What if Kel is just a skinwalker that killed Aubrey in the night of August 17 in Rome Street, Italy at 7 pm
Oddly specific...
What if 3 children are buried under the McDonald’s in Motril, Spain, and I killed them all on the night of march 24th 2022?. . For legal reasons this is a joke
good for her good for her
simply spectacular
Kel is now canonically an old clone of Aubrey whate have you done
naur why does the tomboy act deter u from aubrey mtf agenda… also the home thing? are mtf ppl in your opinion homeless or smt 😭 . . anyway idc if any1 headcannons anyone as anything (as long as it’s not illegal) but then i must say ur reasons r a little… questionable
NOOO I DON’T WANNA TURN INTO AUBREY AAAAAAAA-

hmm, maybe being Aubrey isnt so bad :)


Aubrey is the one behind the camera
You know who's more adorable?. . >!Aubrey!<
YES
Auby 

Charlene's little smile is so sweet!

yeah🥰
YEAH

"sees Aubrey is between Kim and Sunny". . oh I see what you did there
They were the most important people to Aubrey at different periods of her life, I love it.
I should’ve saved my free wholesome award for this.
Fun fact: You can beat aubrey's first fight as if you killed something in headspace if you use the knife at the right time
I adore it
Looks very crammed ngl
Damn, the day after mine
What a dum ass would fit entire watermelon slices, WITH THE GREEN PART AND SEEDS, IN A DAMN CAKE
Very cute, very wholesome seeing the gang+
abry birthdy yaey
happy b-day auby😄🎂🎂
Cool cake


This art is so cute <3
Tsundere energy is strong here.
Aw yeah! Happy birthday AUBREY! 
this is adorable
Happy cake day!
thanks!
Happy Birfday Aubrey!
Wait if Basel is in the picture, who's taking the picture?
>!I said for peach to be Aubrey since Sunny had a crush on Aubrey, whether is reciprocated or not, and Mario has a really obvious crush on Peach (besides I don’t see Peach as the sort of glass cannon character since in every Super Mario game, where she is playable, she is always the slowest character (like Aubrey)!<
I see but.... What if mario accually lokes bowser and uses peach as an excuse and beating each othwr is just being kinky or you know maybe making aubrey peach was rigth
0-0. Your headcanons scare me mister pan-fucker69420
Btw rip for losing your acount
This looks amazing :D
Thank you!!
*oh no they have returned*
~Here comes trouble!~
*and make it double*
Incredible work! Where did you get the jacket? Or did you make it yourself?

Hi its been over a year, but what fabric paint did you use?
This is fucking amazing
Are you the legit Star Smiley? (The YouTube channel)

Just commented this 😑. Shoulda checked if anyone beat me to it lol
UMM HELLO HOLY SHIT . . thats super cool
Damn, got the eyes down and everything.

Thank you! It is! It was a pain to hammer all the nails in there lol
Woow they look so alike, So cool!
Soooooo well done! The contacts are a nice touch. :)
Pls don’t kill me wit da bat

hey im doing that too would u happen to know where to get the jacket for the real world version
Beautiful!
Yeeeees omg 😍 You looking amazing!
10/10 very poggers
WOAH THATS SO COOL
Now that’s some excellent cosplay! Also how long did it take to make that nail bat? That must have been the hardest part!
Wowie that's amazing. You look sm like Aubrey! 😍
😳 SICK COSPLAY DUDE!!!
AH I LOVE THIS COSPLAY WHAT. . THIS IS AMAZING
God tier, simply speaking
mega accurate and mega cute <3 great job here!
Damn that is really good
you're her, she's you. I see no difference.
Every time I see the image i just hear in my head "it means everything"
whered u get that jacket
Terrfic job with the attention to detail. Really did her character justice!
you can very much spell cosplay without slay
woah !!! where did u get the wig ?
Where did you get the headband?
i cant find any jacket that looks likes aubreys :pensive:
OMORI will become real in 45 seconds.
Where did you get the headband??
why dont you post more here? You're gorgeous!
Omg where did you get the wig! I know it's been 2 years but I'm thinking of cosplaying her
How do you get the headband ¿? Please
Help! I wanna cosplay too. Where did u get the sweater/collar,
Is she from an anime?
She is from a video game called omori
That cosplay looks beautiful!
Cutie 🥰
Cutie 🥰
ok love the cosplay! Weird question, pleaseeee tell me where you got the wig and headband, ive been trying to do one of my own but i cant find it, jst the company is fine too.
Hi! I know this is an old post but where did you get the jacket?
Oop just scrolled down some! Never mind!
sonic mentioned . . aubrey would love shadow
Makes sense, Aubrey and Shadow have the same mood and energy, both found tragedy on someone's death, being Mari and Maria, so... Aubrey IS Shadow lol
Friendly reminder that RW Aubrey's feet are open in the image
Tomboy moment?
Yess
Aubrey is just toast
I LOVE THIS
Dam this is super well made
Thank you!!
This is giving me anime vibes and it's awesome
I mean if something is done in an anime style then yeah.
This is awesome! What program did you make this in?
Procreate on the iPad :)
Did you use a pen?
You mean like a stylus? If so, yes!
What one? Been looking for a good one!
I use the iPad Pro 12.9 to draw, so it’s the Apple Pencil :)
Aubrey might be my favorite character from the game. Always love to see the cool fan art of her!
The best fan art I’ve seen in general of omori. Great work
Thank you! 😭💖
It’s like so cute lol I wanna draw as good as you
It's so weird to see Dream Aubrey in a different artstyle
Poggers
I love this art style!
Thank you!💖
I like this art and them.. But I love RL Aubrey more
Woah, this is amazing!
Wow this is really cool
I'm getting Disgaea vibes from this art and I don't know why. Well done!
I’m glad! That was one of my inspirations ☺️
How much to adopt her child version?
Aubrey when she finds >!the 10 Aubrey room in black forest!<
: >!I'm sorry, but i don't like having competition... much less if that competition is cheap copies of me!<
: Come forth, children of Headspace, and **Die.**. . : **NO!!!**
?. . 
This prison... To hold... Me?! *Breaks the cage*
**'WAR' starts playing**

[oh yeah]()

: KEEP EM COMING
: DESTROY
: BE GONE
: THIS.. WILL HURT
:YES, THAT'S IT!
: YOU CANT ESCAPE
WHY IS ULTRAKILL EVERYWHERE. . tell me WHERE the venn diagrams of a game about a man made robot absolutely butchering literal angels and the entirety of the damned souls banished to hell and another game about a teenager >! accidentally killing his sister and creating a dream world to live in to cope with the trauma of it !<FUCKING COLLİDE
every ultrakill player are gay. . every omori player are gay. . see the correlation ?
I like women
u love men kissers? gay
I'm not.a man kisser. I'm a man kissed
a man kissed?
A man kissed i*
I aint a men kisser
fuck you
i play both so 2 gays make a straight (right?)
Both have murder
Because, coin, get the coin, throw the coin, shoot the coin, make a massive genocide by shooting a coin. Congratulations new martial art discovered.
& then Omori just barges in like. . : ayyy aubrey let me live out my fantasy with you having a ctush on me
Aubrey with a Last Resort shoved up in her ass (She could kamikaze on Aubrey and there will still be 6 Aubreys more):. . 
Wtf
&#x200B;. . 
LOOOOL. . So accurate XD
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|disapproval): Why you dreaming about 10 Aubreys figthing for dated you?.
She was beating up the other Aubrey's in the 10 Aubrey room
i love this, especially v2 being HS Aubrey, exactly what i had in mind
Hakaishin Aubrey 💀💀
This is a 100% Aubrey moment XD
DRIP AUBREY
That's... kind of a problem, thanks to multiple reasons.. . Trying to say something about the image... well, RW Aubrey's in the Neighbor's Room, the photos are on the ground, and there's blood on the wall and on her face, which kind of implies that violence took place.. . It's seemingly the most popular image that the artist has made, which... well, is kind of unfortunate. I have no idea how it got so much attention here, to the point of breaking the average, expected karma number.
If Sunny couldn't break free of the Headspace illusion the easy way, then Aubrey will free him the hard way.
I'm not sure how the latter is an issue
Because most of their work does not reach that sort of goal.. . Oh, and that i don't find anything really unique about the image, not enough to warrant it getting so much attention.
I get that, but I don't see how that could be considered an issue. Sure, their other work may not be getting the attention this piece is, but the attention and appreciation for this piece is good news.
Yeah, it really isn't (or shouldn't be) an actual issue, but it's odd to me.. . Moving on.
Aubrey, eating life jam won't make you live longer!. . Even less chance if you didn't even eat it...
When Aubrey searchs in google: "how to enter your crush's dreams"
That's... ... Kinda romantic in some way.
This would be fucked lorewise but this gives me an idea for some sort of spin-off roguelite game something in the same vein as Dead Cells. . . You play as real world Aubrey who has somehow entered Headspace and now fights her way through every location while trying to find Omori.. . She meets with the dream friends which can function as summons similar to Hades, probably finding new weapons, abilities, the usual roguelite stuff.
Sounds fun.. . Also happy cake day pal 
Thank you, friend!
You're welcome.
best aubrey art I ever see

aubrey what are you reaching for
Surprise attack!. . AUBREY became FLUSTERED!
Aubrey uses SPIKED BAT! . . Sunny fainted and was sent to the hospital . . Aubrey gained guilt!
Aubrey caught a SOMETHING!. . Give the SOMETHING a name?
SUNNY trying to kiss AUBREY.. #. HIT IN THE HEART!. #. ...that was moving attack.. #. AUBREY took 999 damage. #. AUBREY become CONFUSED.
hehehe
Aubrey, I swear to god, if you don't kiss him back we've got a problem. He deserves it!
Not really. Aubrey seemed pretty interested.
it is fairly obvious aubrey still likes sunny after the 4 years
Aubrey you fucking killed him 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143 143

Big smack

Hi
Ancient times
Aubrey drives like my brother lol
Who plays this for 570 hours? I got all achievements in 150
afk hours I guess?
I got like 50 on my first playthrough because the game kept running in the background lol
Thats month of gaming.. (source: i played for month cookie clicker and got around 1.5k hours also)
50 hours is only 2 days and 2 hours though.. 
Uh, i totally commented on comment with 1.5k hour talk
Either I'm stupid and dont understand what u said or you had a stroke-
No, guy edited comment
Oh, weird
My first playthrough was 270 hours because It kept track of the time when I turned the console off but didn't close the game
How many playthroughs of the game have you done?
Not enough.
probably just left it running.. mine was like 300 by end because I kept leaving it on when I wasn't playing lmao
I got all in like 75 but now I have hundreds cause of mods lmao
i got 100% in 86 hours
I have around 150-ish for only half the achievements rn bc I keep leaving it running in the bg when I’m not playing. So that’s probably how.
Either replaying for fun or playing some mods, I guess
People who have no lives and play games for a living, aka pro gamers...
simp
















you're a gross colour 
That doesn’t even make any sense.
found the bri'ish
actually funnily enough im not even british - at some point i started saying words with their extra u's for no reason and then it just sorta stuck
oh no, you are being colonised
ah ~~bollocks~~ fuck - i was too busy taking my denial medicine
Hice. Kuke. Bectar. Maughty. O. . . . . . I'm confused
HAHAHA that’s what I thought at first
AUBREY I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID

The country above Nigeria
with an extra g in the middle
god i hate being black and a part of this fandom
The comment above mine was not needed.
I apologize
It's fine :)

Woah there. You can't say that in Minecraft Mate!
She said nremoved... Like thats not even a word homie...
nevermind, i agree.
IT WAS REMOVED LMAO
Auby gamer moment
the [u/\[deleted\]]()!
XD
I didn't know that Omori write reviews on steam
This explains a lot though…
So is that what she meant with, “No, YOU are gross color”?
It is what it is
It's what it's
I love the idea of them spending over 500 hours on the prologue.
Aubrey drawing a sky as a kid:yeh . . . . Kel: whoa watch out that’s sky the wrong color . . . . . And you know what happens next
Autopsy report: a young girl named Aubrey was found in a ditch next to a bottle of Orange liquid and the young girl has been dead for what looks like a week now and looked like she was beaten to death with a round shaped object further examination is required for the town and the people in it as well as the dead body, report #1
Bro is tannedsist 
That sounds like Kansas except with a T.

Based auby /s

Proof that aubrey is racist
Also this comment is a joke aubrey is not racist
Brown is a great color, Aubrey and this person have no taste.


auby when cancelled 
Useless waste is afraid of browns!
Me who got Omori free via Pirating:
this is a joke, right?
💪
The amount of people being…weird on here is very upsetting :(
Okay but 573 hours tho
Gross color

Based
Aubrey: I quickly became rascist, hating latinos became a part of my lifestyle
You know they are in love
Hello based department?
That's rakist 
Based gamer Auby
Omorcist
What?. . huh?? 
aubrey redditor
that’s playing through the story about 28.65 times if he does it in about 20 hours
r/accidentalracism
How does one play omori for 570 hours
Racist,

r/usernamechecksout
Shitty rewiews in steam are covered in bees
racism
“*You’re* a gross colour!”. . - Aubrey
hes literally not though either
How to immediately give Aubrey the manic emotion
And then furious
Then depressed
How to immediately cycle through all emotions rapidly
those subtitles are epic
Lol, thank you!
I can't believe 90s Aubrey said that to Sunny!
She has such a way with words 😌
this is amazing! i love this so much 🌟🌟
Aw, thanks! :') That makes me really happy to hear
All according to keikaku.
Keikaku means cake
cake means pastry
You ruined it, you ruined and I’m leaving
have a nice trip
Probably see you next fall
cake means plan
THANK YOU!!!!
this looks soooo pretty
Ah, thank you!! I honestly feel like I learned a lot about overlays and whatnot while playing with the colors so I'm glad it looks alright :)
YOOOOOOO
Let's goooooo :D
Why does this look as if it could fight in omoris time frame, what i mean by this is that it looks like the story was set in the late 1900s ext. 1994 - 1995
Those subtitles are so brutally honest damn
Okay, now imagine this. The Japanese dub is amazing, well written, and well voice acted. . . . . ...Then the English dub is like Ghost Stories
[This]() but with Aubrey and her rabbit
"I hope you can find some peace... or you know... some happiness."
This is art, well done!
Thanks!
Aubrey will always be beutiful, always
THAT LOOKS AWESOME
There's no need to pretend.
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO9
Beautiful art.
YOOOOOOO 😳😳😳
Well! This is just impressive!
Aubrey but the design fits the timeframe OMORI takes place in
Aw dude that’s sick
wow, im in awe. especially since those animes were my childhood
You really nailed the aesthetic, amazing job on it!
“pathetic.”
deep
What’s she looking at?
Princess Bubblegum?
Aubrey spitting facts
i wanna stab her so bad
Here's the attention you ordered happy now lmao?
Dude wtf is wrong with you
I FUCKING HATE AUBREY
ok, keep it to yourself
I'm so sorry to hear that
Dude poor her, what did she do?
SHE EXISTED
Bruh... Wtf
This dude hates everything, ignore him
Great subtitles
damn,what she said was really heartbreaking... 😔
That’s why Aubrey punched him
...that's a trope of a romantic subplot...you do know that, right?
Honestly Aubrey should be in her own semi pile
No
The reason why is thatI don’t think Aubrey should be in a relationship with Basil because of all of the times she bullied him
Nah, as long as they’re of age and not related, it’s cool.
She deserves love
Tbf by making her look mature in this manner he’d actually be doing away with pedos. Sexualizing headspace aubrey and those characters would be different but pedos like kids not adults that are canonically kids
nah aubrey just says we cant pay that much or something like that and the fight continues as usual
Aubrey looks... Focused. Probably taking notes 
Yeah, she's gonna use it on Omori

: Sorry, but I like boys
: I also like boys, you in particular\~
: Okay, but as long as you're not a boy, I don't like you romantically. But we can still be friends.

Aubrey looks inspired
You already know Aubrey’s mind is going capturing EVERY SINGLE DETAIL!
What? There wasn't any openly shown drinking smoking lol. I mean if you consider >!Aubrey's parents!< then yeah but still
should've been aubrey
Why not both?
no
why did I get downvoted
cuz Aubrey slander
aubrey is fucking annoying how is she likeable

[ohthisthisisbeautiful.mp4](). . I already liked and retweeted this on Twitter, but the small animation makes it even better. Amazing work!
Yay, I'm happy you got to see the gif too!! :D
another beautiful piece!
I don't its feasible for you to make bad artwork tqbh
Aw lol I hope I dont make bad art
Aww I find this so incredibly cute! Amazing job!
Thanks so much!! I love drawing cute stuff :DD
Thanks :)
I abso-fricking-lutely love this, the drawing is wonderful, the colors are great, Aubrey looks super cute and the animation is wonderful, probably my favorite Aubrey fan art
Awww yay I'm so happy you like it!!
Your caption is definitely correct!!
Yup Yup!
I really wish that there was more of an interaction with killing the bunnies or not killing them. I spent the entire game running from any encounter with bunnies because I thought killing them would permanently affect the story by making aubrey mad
I LOVE EVERY SINGLE DRAWING YOU DO ITS ALL SO PRETTY, THE ANIMATION IS SO COOL TOO.
Awww thanks leadinglettuce! <3 glad you're enjoying the art ^^
AAA i love this💕
Aww thanks! c:
Pretty sure this is a spoiler, but great art either way!
Time to earn leafie's rewards
Aubrey will make pesto out of leafie
I love your comments LOL
I am looking through your older pictures and looking at that smiling Aubrey gave me the biggest smile you could imagine and made me tear up. How are you so good!
I just love omori and drawing lol, but thanks I really appreciate it <3
I can relate to this pic exept i have a cat nice drawing/anim have a nice day!
I feel like Aubrey's voice would sound like that
I feel like Aubrey's voice would sound like that
>!My headcanon: Many months after the game's end, Aubrey and Basil become friends again. Of course, they both still feel guilty for what they did, but slowly, everything is getting better. Aubrey decides to move in with Basil after him offering many times and her mother's continued neglect. Yes, all of the characters still have their personal issues to deal with, but bit by bit, things are looking up. Polly design inspired by !<[this post]() :) This took incredibly long (due to lack of motivation mostly) but I do have more comics like these planned, although it'll be a little while before the next one. And of course, this is just a headcanon so feel free to put your own in the comments.
that was incredible, excellent work!
thank you :)
**Absolutely work.**. . >!Will Aubrey meet Sunny again in your headcannon!< ;—;
That sounds like there would be so much angst and you are giving me way too many ideas lol. . >!Like what if Aubrey and the gang went through the trouble to clean the house only for aubreys mom to completely disregard their hard work and mess it up immediately. And that being the last straw as for what gets her to accept basils offer to live with him!<
for auby,. . >!i always assumed that her father had passed away, and that's why the mom is the way she is. she fell into a deep depression and never got out of it. i don't think that was ever confirmed by the game though. it would make aubrey leaving her more painful too, which is why i showed the mom feeling a lil remorse!<. . for bagel,. . >!people have mentioned that the fact that he knew how to tie a noose might allude to him having a dark childhood... im sure he was super lonely. at one point in the game sunny mentions that there was a spot at their dinner table for him specifically, showing that he visited a lot ;-;!<
Don't the churchgoers after the church fight talk about how Aubrey's father left?
I'm just a bit confused, is this supposed to be read left to right or right to left? It kind of works either way but yeah!
The Good Ending
**MORE LIKE BEST ENDING**
The bestest ending
I now cannot unthink about Aubrey accidentally calling Polly Mom. And being extremely embarassed.. . And Basil consoling her, telling that this is a thing that happened to him too.
They are sibilings, children of Polly. Thanks for the headcanon
The bunny sparks joy
indeed it does :)
This is perfect
Words cannot express how much I love this.
I AM GOING TO CRY
SAME LET ME CRY WITH YOU
Your art is really cute!
Aubrey's mom kinda looking like a zombie- Aubrey made the right choice. :D
it was so hard to resist drawing her as i drew the other characters haha
Who’s the other woman?  Polly?
Yeah
It's Aubreys mom.
I really like this comic and art style. I also liked how Aubrey’s mom looked just like an older version of her, since my headcannon for after the bad ending is that Aubrey eventually becomes just like her mom.
daang that's dark but a great headcanon!
Aaaaaaa so cute, and I love that it looks almost offical
thanks! I was gonna go for a 100% official style but after weeks of procrastinating things go out the window lol. maybe next time
Nice to see other people with headcanons like mine!
one of us, one of us, one of-
one of us, one of us...
tecnoblade and omori confirmed?
technoboat pog
thought the mom only drank
The mom is an *asshole*
yeah i think so, added in smoking since i thought it would look better (in an art sense) if she was holding a cigar instead of an alcohol bottle (easier to understand at a glance)
She never had an actual room in years i feel so bad but also so happy
:D
Aww good bot :)
very good bot :D
This is amazing. I don’t really know what to say, I’m just glad everyone is relatively happy. Thank you for making this, good work
:)
im not crying, you are
;—;
aubeyyyyyyyyyyy you mind if i steal this idea for a fic im planning
go for it!
ty!
this is the best headcanon from omori that ive seen 🥺 my heart💜💜💜
God that moment when her mom asks and you can see all the emotion she wants to scream before calming down is so powerful.
Adorable!
This is so adorable!
Our headcanon
I'm going to cry this is beautiful what
I approve of this head cannon! 👍
okay this is what i pray happens now
FINALLY, something good happened in Aubrey's life    :D :)
:D
Hmmm, I have a sudden urge to ship them
i personally dont just because aubrey did used to bully basil even if they made up later, but gotta say that the ship name bushfire is amazing lol
As a good old friend :3
wholesome . . thx for the work !
İ AM DYİNG OF CUTENESS HELP
I love this so much, amazing work
I love this so much
this is phenomenal and you got the original art style down so perfectly!
Wholesome :D
Why did her mom even ask? She should’ve already known the answer.
she chose to care even just a little bit like an actual mom right as Aubrey is leaving ;-;
Do I spot a smidge of regret in Aubrey's mom when she leaves?
Prob a small part of her sort of wondering why she let things get to this point.. . Likely a small portion of her still had love for Aubrey. Often when we loose things do we realise that we actually cared.
Happy Auby and happy Bagel makes me happy.
oh hey, I've thought about this scenario happening as well! In fact, planning for it to happen in a fic I'm writing lol.
I love this so much, so cute, so sweet, post canon Aubrey and Basil friendship gives me life. Also that little 'awkward awkard' is so fricking adorable.
Ty :) their friendship also gives me life, looking forward to drawing more
AaAaAaAaaaaaAaaAa MY HEART IS MELTING!  . The headcanon is very cute and believable and the art is so good, amazing work man!
why is she an eggplant
somehow it makes me happy inside just to see everything go well and nice and i wish that happened
That 3 panel pause after responding hit me like a sack of bricks.
This gives me the happy brain juice
This is really good, amazing
Oh my fucking god he called himself "marscapone". . Just to be clear: i'm not angry at you, i'm just a little disappointed. Really good art though
c h e e s e :p and spelled incorrectly lol. u dont like mascarpone??
I love mascarpone! It's basically the key ingredient for the tiramisù, along with eggs
owie this one hurt. but I absolutely love this hc!!
this is so good
Buddy this is too good, thank you for making this! I'm definitely headcannoning it!
this is canon now
This is absolutely wholesome!
noice.
"Probably not." *(SLAM)* XD
gosh dang it I haven't cried in a while. Thanks
Truly great art. I was missing this dimension of the ending and I am happy to have seen it. Great job
Good shit good shit
Mate, this is beautiful, I'm subbing to u
thank you :) finally gonna be posting more art soon
I don’t think Aubrey is short for Aubergine lol. . Aubergine is what Brits call Eggplants 🍆. . Edit: I stand corrected
[about that….]()
Whaaaat
>!Now we know why she hates her parents lmao!<
Lol. . Also, that explains Mr. Plantegg
i was surprised as well loll
This is after the good ending or bad ending?
Nice
Sobbing take my upvote

Polly's pretty much is the best conclusion for Aubrey, because... obviously the current status is not good.. . Anyways, wholesome.
Ok i need explanation on the 5th one and buff aubrey
buff aubrey
buff aubrey
polly is an angel fr. . CERTAIN PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM HER, LIKE AUBREYS MOM
We are well aware
does that really matter when she acts more like she is than his ACTUAL parents?
Perhaps that's why she's good with the leaf lover boy
This picture will always confuse me because I'm not sure why Aubrey is blushing
She's embarrassed! Or at least I think she is?
jesse what the fuck are you talking about
real. (real)
real. (real)
can someone explain why aubrey’s mom is a douche? I know a bit of why but i’d like to know the full reason and lore for why her parents suck
I relate to Auby. . No father? Check. . Is racist? Check. . Bullies children? Check
That's what he's racist for
You're racist and a bully? Damn..
I mostly relate to Aubrey on a personal level. Genuinely.
i got suspended because someone said their headcanon was that aubrey rips leaves for fun and i replied  "d\*e you stupid leaves" (censored so i dont get suspended again). . basically the system kind of sucks balls
implies aubrey had a negative speech level
:Isn't that true though
Aubrey failed her Charisma check.  
aubreys pov:  i must hit him with a bat to make him love me

Somehow, i can't imagine Aubrey ever muttering the word "dweeb".
Adorable.  I love AUBREY as a character.  She's so relatable to me.
Ah, I too like beating up my friends with a nailed bat
Real men attack their friends with battle axes
Only true homies bash your skull in with the moest brutal weaponry imaginable
man, I remember when i used to beat the shit out of my friends.. . . . . but seriously, Aubrey's pretty cool as a  character
Yea bro bullying your lonely best friend for four years is so cool 👍
You relate to a bully? 
I relate to violent coping mechanisms.
Aubrey be like "holy shit is that a gun?". . 
This is dumb.. . Everyone knows Aubrey's tank is pink. Get your facts straight smh.
Careful now, you're gonna attract a lot of Aubrey fans who are gonna tell you "she only uses it for intimidation" even though she very much uses it and the menus show her equipping it. . . We have many Aubrey fans on this sub smoking copium.
Text in combat says “aubrey kicks you”, “aubrey punches you” etc. . . Violence, just not bat violence
Yeah. Tho funnily enough her head but hits like a fucking TRUCK! She doesn’t need the bat
Ya, like if Aubrey actually used her bat, she would legitimately one shot people and kill them. There would be no "fight" for us to win lol and Kel and Sunny wouldn't be walking around afterwards.. . The only thing I can imagine is that Aubrey used the bat for intimidation and actual gang violence (if that exists in faraway).
Even if there isn't any hardcore gang violence, even smaller towns that I know of have their fair share of juvenile violence (at least between kids in different parts of town or from different schools). It just depends what crowd you run with. I would assume Aubrey would be exposed to that.
She specifically has a skill, homerun, in which she uses her bat. And guess what, its an instant kill move
If that's her using the bat, she's **real bad** at it. Honestly for a once per fight skil, it's could at least deal low damage.
but the only time you get to use aubrey irl is in a dream sequence so moot
so sunset in faraway?
She has a skill called homerun in which she uses her bat.
average copium addict
iirc she did use it in the church fight?
No, she just held it. Using the bat is a kill-move. (As seen by her homerun skill)
But also "AUBREY attacks x!" with the aubrey attack animation, which is meant to be a bat, or bat-like weapon
"ummm actually a bat with nails in it is far less dangerous than a steak knife" 🤓
The game itself says otherwise
I mean the description of Aubrey's bat, if I'm remembering correctly, literally says that it's more dangerous than a steak knife.
Carrying it around in the first place and using it for "intimidation" is still enough to justify using a comparatively small knife to defend yourself.
Definitely, Sunny was justified in defending himself, even as a fan of Aubrey!
especially since this is probably sunny’s first time seeing aubrey pull up with the bat, who knows what she’ll do?
She only uses it for intimidation tho 
No, she doesn't. She uses it in one of her skills.
It isn't canon,are you telling me they just have a rpg battle in the middle of a slap fight?! It's only there to make the game interassting
I mean Aubrey hangs out with a group that actually abuses, steals and is a public nuisance, I’ll take a child with a knife as a friend any other day
To the people saying the bat is “for intimidation” and that “she doesn’t use it”. She actually does use it. Her normal attack is “Aubrey attacks ” and will play the bat swinging animation on whoever is attacked.
People who say she doesn't use her bat are on some hard-core copium
but the recicultist quest was a daydream?
yeah, but by the looks of it, the nails in the bat aren't all the way through. so yes, it is a nail bat, but only the heads of the nails are hitting.
Um, it probably still really hurts.
: I came here to kick ass and relive traumatic memories, and uh... .  (mumbling to himself): Wait, that wouldn't work because.... . : Oh, forget it. Let's just get this over with.. . (IT HIT RIGHT IN THE HEART!). . (AUBREY TOOK 99 DAMAGE!)
: Ugh... I need to go.... . (Aubrey leaves the park.). . (The end...for now.)
> (IT HIT RIGHT IN THE HEART!). . That cannot be survivable.
damn Aubrey kinda bad. PS: this is the fifth time now. it’s a joke..
auby is so pretty!
Aubrey deserved it 
I mean that he didn't for example (as far as we know) do anything to aubrey even after she bullied him for 4 years for a pretty goofy reason
Okay, most of these aren't correct, though I will say that Aubrey's mom is, at the very least, implied to be neglectful, which is a form of abuse.
She's severely neglectful and she's also putting Aubrey's health in danger, judging by how trashed the place is.
Wish ii was auby
saem 
I sense a group hug coming 
Coming heheheehehehehheehehh
Saaaaaaaame.
I know I'm a little late to the Party, but I wanted to say something as well.  . . . I've noticed that different subreddits of different games tend to ruin the experience for me.  . Same happened with Omori.  . . . When I first played it, I had **no idea** what I was about to experience. Never heard of the game, never saw a single frame of it. Literally just saw it was on sale on Steam and had almost only positive reviews.  . . . And now I'm here. Finished 100% of the Game. I love the Story, the characters, the writing, everything. Although the Gameplay-Part is somewhat lacking. But it's a RPG-Maker-Game. So they made the best of it.  . . . When I found out about this sub I was expecting a community of people like me. People who really enjoyed the Story. But it didn't take long to realise that a huge part of this community seems like they never even installed the game in the first place or are just not mature enough to understand what is going on.  . . . The other day there was a theory-post about Aubrey being an unplanned-/accidental child.  . And OP said, that this theory might be "disturbing"...  . I mean.. are we talking about the same game? psychological horror, self-harm, depression, suicide, murder. All of this and we say **unplanned parenthood** might be **disturbing**?  . . . Also: Im aware that most fandoms love to do this, but I never understood it.  . The whole headcanon and shipping thing.  . There is a Story. And it's canon. Someone put a whole lot of work into it.  . If I were that person and people would start to make whole thread-discussions over a topic that isn't even officially part of the game I would totally lose it.  . Same with the shipping. The game suggests 2 possible love interests. hero - mari (which is pretty obvious) and sunny - aubrey (which is implied in the late-game)  . So why would we start to make up anything other than that?  . . .   . I guess all i wanted to say is:  . as fans of the game, we should all respect the art.  . And a whole lot of people on this sub are just way too young.
Omori x Aubrey is canon as much as i know
Sunny canonically likes Aubrey but it is unknown if she felt the same.
It's hinted since >!she wanted to ask for his phone number/wanted to confess about something on the swing and before they checked the tree house!<
I wonder is Aubrey still wants that after what happend
Perchance.
yea that’s what i know too
Why do everyone draws Aubrey with bandages in her legs? I cant recall seeing her legs at any point of the game
Aubrey foot 

No, im still waiting on my Aubrey sequel
I think he's in the "middle" part of the submissive graph for Aubrey fans.. . It could be a lot worse, obviously.
Aubrey got rock blocked
Aubrey’s tie grows in relation to how intense her emotions are
.... . The math works sometimes.
aubrey would suplex him
*AUBY NO*
at least she's not homophob-  okay nvm
i mean its the early 2000s theres probably a good chance she is
Wait til she find out he’s also aiming for her emo boy
Actually probably not, like there is official wlw art of Aubrey, though it was from before omori came out
she could be wlw but in denial and homophobic
Oh seriously? Hit me with the source
. . I do wish it was in the game but yeah there is at least official artwork of this
There's little credibility behind this one.  The drawing is very hard to see, there is no confirmation of which characters are these,  and the source is a tweet with four likes and no replies or retweets aswell as no sources for the image shown. Calling this official confirmation is a big stretch
I mean I’ve met a few wlw people who were homophobic towards gay men
wait a minute. . she loves to go to church and she is probably Christian, i think you know where i'm going with this
>! wait, doesn't she only go outta guilt? not because she actually believes? !<
>!yeah she does only visit outta guilt i just said that to try be a little bit funny!<
ah! sorry
It's Christianfobic/s. (Edit: I know how toxic my community about religion that says to love everyone and be nice is, and I am teriblly sorry for us)
She's part of one of those congregations that accept everyone 
I mean, they accept her
Ah, so if she was asian, she'd probably be filipino
*you have said the summoning words. filipinos will arrive shortly. prepare*
I have arrived
an idiot filipino arrived >:3
**Who dares call us**
you fool, i have already arrived.
Inaccurate
nah I do agree with you. Either Filipino or Vietnamese
not all christians are homophobic, in fact its mostly catholics that are homophobic
Yeah... no the most ppl that acept gay is catholics christians read a bible... a bit em every phobo thing you know?.. And that's the canon one for what they say so i chose to believe in nothing
no dude, most of the people that are homophobic, are the catholics, because they live by the bibles word and not the overarching message above that of "people sin, but this cool guy named jesus forgives" also as well as "yo, dont determine if someone finna go to hell bro, only god and this cool dude i mentioned before named jesus can make that decision", catholics typically dont accept that kind of thing, *typically* then theres catholics and other christians similar to me that support gay people or are like "yo do your thing"
Dude catholics in eu?. I am in chile and here the catho are standing a lot about gay ppl and trans too.. I think we got a culture prob here
standing a lot??? im sorry i cant understand can you rephrase that
Understanding I think.
ah, thanks for telling me
Pretty sure Orthodox people are phobic as hell, much more than Catholics.. . Source: i lived in the predominantly Orthodox country of Romania. And now i'm trans. I had to move out to Germany to not get beaten up in school.
oh shit, well thats interesting
I'm not sure it's so much the religion just more the eastern mindset compared to the somewhat more modern ? I guess western mindset thinking most catholic countries are more in the west yk. Btw I am a resident of Romania just as a thing.
And it's not even neceseraly because of religion but nobody minds that much people making fun of and treating people like that shit. Kids aren't fucking religious 99.99% you can't fucking fool me. They're just assholes and it's not a thing that's normalized here just because it's not a western country Ig.
yea, because out of my own experiences as a person in the west mostly "religious" people that would be catholic or orthordox or whatever were people who would say homophobic things like that, so it probably just is where people live
as a trans lesbian who grew up in a lutheran family, lutherans are pretty awful too.
oh, im sorry that, that happened
Aren't most christians catholics?
yes i believe so
"Not all christians are homophobic" - absolutely correct.   . "It's mostly catholics" - I feel like this is incorrect.
its partly correct, there are some Catholic Christians that arent homophobic, then there are some grouped up in a pile that say shit like "you'll go to hell for" and some dumb thing
My point was, generally there are more Catholics in pro-LGBTQ countries than in anti-LGBTQ countries. In any case, saying \[insert a specific type of a religion/nationality/etc\] is more homophobic than \[insert the general religion/nationality/etc\] is never correct, especialy if you add "in fact" without noting where the information came from. Although factors such as religion could influence a person's view on this topic, there are always exceptions. I understand that there are indeed many Catholics that are anti-LGBTQ, but don't generalize please.
i didnt generalize i said "most" because out of my experiences with homophobic people they were mostly heavy catholic christians
> its mostly catholics that are homophobic. . I think it's Evangelists, at least in the US
It's complicated because evangelicalism can be used variously to describe Protestantism, a specific theological strain within Protestantism, or a quasi-political religious subculture partly rooted in a backlash to feminism and the civil rights movement.
\*sigh\* [you're both wrong](), at least as far as the US is concerned.
Hey what are you talking about.
She can't be homophobic,she has a girlfriend!. . ^(it's in times like this that I feel sad for not having a Kim emoji to use.)
: yes I’m gay yes I’m homophobic we exist
: I'm not homophobic, it's just that the people I most hate are coincidentally very gay, that's all!

“Collation does not mean causation”
Indeed not. It means snack.
oh yes! that's right! sorry auby! (still racist)
More like a bitchfriend
 You can say that she's in the *Aub-right*
I want to slap you so hard right now, but that was a really good pun.
??
Even better😏
Confused
Auby yes
AUBY YES
Seriously though, where did the racist aubrey thing start
that was headspace/angsty aubrey atleast i guess i dunoo never played the game eyy
Walter white reference??????!!!!!
Jesse. . We need to face the truth
I'd love it if someone dubbed this
Real
jesse, there is something i see behind u
An indicator is perhaps Aubrey's mother, who has light brown hair
Until you realise that white people have all the hair colours commonly!
imma guess white tbh
She’s Aubrey.
She's has ascended past the concept of races.
she's just that powerful

okay my head Cannon is Aubrey is half white and half asian
She is R'lyehian
Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Auby R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn
oh r'lye?
Does the game ever give a set location? I don't remember. But I feel like Aubrey is one of those where setting would def affect what I view her as. . . Like most people in Japan agree Sailor Moon is Asian, as it is set in Japan and created by Japanese artists, but many white americans assume she is white b/c blue eyed blonde despite the setting and origin. Aubrey kind of feels like one of those where the player's bg has more of an effect on how we see her ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|thinkingfacehmm). . Alternately if you're gonna break it down just by looks, her features are closest to Mari so my guess would be at least part asian
I think OMORI is definitely set in the US, due to the fact that real world currency is given in dollars with a George Washington symbol. I assume the time it takes place is late 90s early 00s. I assume that Aubrey would be American from this
What about Canada or Australia? They both use dollars and have beach’s
From the art calendar how they celebrate Thanksgiving in November definitely not Canada and winter in December definitely not Australia
It's set in the (probably) eastern us.
Hmmm you know i think you have a good point
imo i think she's wasian
She is tarnished
rise tarnished
Rice tarnished.
Playing at becoming lord
I’m gonna say she’s white just so there can be two of each
Based 
balanced
White probably because she is Christian and the only part of East Asia that is plurality Christian is South Korea and while that would be very interesting her heritage isn’t mentioned so it’s anyones guess. I would put a higher weight on White though because the game is set in a small town
nah religion doesn't really change much as much of my family who moved from Singapore to Australia are all very christian. and its quite common for Asian people to become christian when they migrate to a more western country.
vouch. source: am from singapore and born in aus
Double vouch. Source: am from Aus and born in Singapore
yeah my family came from hong kong and they've been christians for as long as they can remember
yeah true, This can even just be proved with statistics, around 1/3 of the global population (2/3 in America specifically as well) are Christian, and 5.7% of Americans are Asian, so there's bound to be overlap being the most common religion both globally and in America.. . According to google, 42% of Asian Americans are Christian.
My mom's side of the family is christian, and they are from Vietnam.
i can see her being korean but the small town part and "not many asians are christian" don't matter
oh yeah definitely lol, in the end duet scene you can see him holding hands with Aubrey and he looks like a fucking ghost
yeah cause aubrey touches grass
To me auby is auby.
Clearly Aubrey is Argentinian or Chilean
as an argentinian myself I confirm we are racist XD. 
ARGENTINIAN AUBREY LET’S FUCKING GOOOO
It's obvious. She's a bitch
She's a bitch
Aubrey is a creature beyond mortal comprehension, she is a woman.
wasian
I mean, she could be mixed race. Hapa!
I just imagined her as half white half Asian in my head for some reason …? Maybe cause it’s similar to my group of friends
As a wasian person, she's wasian. Canon because I said so 💪
Same 💪
Same 💪
She looks white to me tbh
Polynesian
Homo sapien.
Aubrey is a sixth dimensional five-headed centaur shapeshifter that has been sent from અરે પિઝા અહીં છે to research about humans so her nation can greatly take over the earth and destroy humanity. End of story
yeah but she has to have a human cover if she's playing a character right?
Yes. And she simply just made an ai that was fed with really really pretty models so it can set the beauty standart. Then she made the ai make "the prettiest human in the world", and it made Aubrey. Notice how she looks compeletely mixed of every race? Yea, it's because of that. So to answer your question, the human the sixth dimensional slug is playing is just an ai-made creation
CaucASIAN
Aubrey is a demon from the far lands
She is Br*tish
I think she’s half white and half Asian
gay or european? it's hard to guarantee
Human
She could be mixed ig
maybe mixed
maybe she's mixed?
I think she's autistic
Definitely white
white?
idk🤔 I suppose she's just British or something like that, lol
White snow
she is neither. she is god
I always assumed wasian ig
I thought I saw something about her being Puerto Rican but idk where I saw it from.
Personally I think she’s white because seeing her family kinda points at it also. 
Aubrey is normal
why not be both??
I think she’s wasian, specifically of Korean and Anglo-American descent . . The Korean thing is because a lot of Korean ppl are Christian but that’s just my headcanon and I’m not claiming to be right or anything lol
Maybe American French cause Albury sounds French but idk
She's Auberginian
Maybe wasian???
Maybe she's mixed?
This is so funny cause I never even considered what race anyone was, I just played the game lol
Vegetable
What are you stupid, she’s clearly “???” It literally says it right there
I feel like Basil is a Greek Orthodox Christian while Aubrey is a Italian Catholic Christian
Just as white as Numbah 1 from Kids Next Door?
polish
She's god
Some wiki's say that aubreys full name is "aubergine" I am not sure if aubrey is an abbrevation or something like that I never had any friends with that name. . . . Update: I searched a little And some sites Said that the name "aubergine" is french, and is also gender neutral
mr plantegg
black aubrey
Bri"ish
I think she's white, don't kill me.
what
lebanese maybe? some arabic people can look really white
Bosnian. Trust me.
Jew?
She goes to church
In the game it was said that she isn’t part of the congregation. She started coming to church somewhere after Mari’s death and seem to treat it as a place of safety, since she dosen’t have that at her house. . . I do believe other characters from the church mentioned something about her mother and seemed to side with her having problem with Aubrey and not the other way around. So it’s possible Aubrey and her mother may have attended the church when she was younger. So either her mother is an atheist or dosen’t bother to be involved with her religion sufficiently. . . I wonder what Aubrey actually came to believe in, but I don’t think she believes in Christianity either. I think she has faith/hope in afterlife and seeks some kind of closure with Mari. Alternatively despite timing, her attendance is completely disconnected from Mari incident and is just caused by her issues at her house. Then she treats the church as someone who dosen’t like to read, treats library.
Someone can be Jewish ethnically or secularly based on heritage but still not practise judaism. In jewish religious law someone who is Jewish is Jewish for life, you can’t opt out via participating in another religion if your mother is Jewish or u converted  which I think is cool
Maybe she converted?
you can also be ethnically jewish and practice other religions
😐
what? 
I dunno
What’s more confusing for me is aubrey gets blue eyes in real world when we can clearly see they’re black in the past
They're contacts, you can see she has black eyes in her photo with Kim
She wears contact lenses I think
God
anyone else think its weird and lame that there is absolutely no black ppl in this game lol
I coulda sworn there were black NPCs in the real world portions of the game...
we have one, and they are a massive bitch 
why is this getting downvoted this subreddit is weird
I mean I somewhat agree on these headcanons but you could also just be completely wrong.
Again its not important its just hints and implications, not everyone wears their heritage as a personality trait. I also acknowledged it doesnt matter I was just curious about Aubrey because she has less to go on when it comes to indicators chill out
I know I think you're just being way too conclusive about it.
Grown up Aubrey has blue eyes. While it could be contacts considering she also has dyed hair, I’m gonna go with Caucasian
It is contacts, it was said in game, wasn't it?
I believe you I just don’t remember. Been a while since I played
Oh, ok
I think they're probably contacts. You can see she doesn't have blue eyes in other scenes like the [duet flashbacks]() or her [picture with Kim]()
They are contacts...?  [proof]()
ooooof you are wrooooong
about which part?
a lot of it
which ones
I think they are all humans and that matters more than their lineage.. .  Fretting over your lineage is what leads you and your family to be killed of by 4 kids and have multi generational trauma weaken your descendants, so that they also succumb to said kids with the last remaining one drowning in alcohol and depression. That is really this bad to obsess over heritage like that.
I think she black
They support lgbt
Ey another fellow with poor racial detection sensors
Hispanic are latinos
Being from Spain makes you Hispanic but it doesnt make you Latino because Spain is in Europe not Latin America
Hispanic just means they're from Spanish speaking origins, so if you dont know where someone is from only that theyre from Spanish speaking background you say they're Hispanic.
NAH RLLY THATS CRAZYYY
Hispanic folks *can be* latino, but they aren't all latino. Same vice versa, since Brazil is majority Portuguese-speaking but still latino. "Hispanic" means Spanish-speaking, while "latino" means from latin america.
That’s fake, not latin América are the latinos from america, but the portugueses ans Spanish are latinos
[Breaking News: The Britannica is Fake According to a Redditor]()
Oh. Okay I see what you're saying. Yes, people from Spain and Portugal are not latino. However, Spanish folks are typically considered Hispanic, since Hispanic means Spanish-speaking. That's why there are Hispanic latinos but there are also latinos who aren't Hispanic. Brazilians are latinos who aren't Hispanic, because the official language is Portuguese, even though they might not be Portuguese by heritage. Mexicans are latinos who *are* Hispanic, because the official language is Spanish, even though they might not be Spanish by heritage.
WHITE->
Aubrey's ethnicity is Girl
Irish
Clearly she's a Corpus
Clearly she is from Waterdeep
Aubrey is Aubrey
Anteny is British with extremely heavy accent
Personally I headcanon aubrey as Quebecois
White? You mean American?
Japanese?
I am an unknown breed LMAO
I think Basil and Aubrey are europeans
Most definitely white
She looks European to me for so,e reason??
also white i guess?
she's precious
i think shes mixed, white mom and asain dad maybe?
Spanish
ascending above the concept of race
Auby is . . *BRI'ISH*
I I’m pretty sure she’s white but I doesn’t really matter what race anyone is
gross color
mixed maybe?
Auby is probably white
Spanish
Aubrey’s extra white
She is a Polish icon /j
She's white
I'm pretty sure she's white. I've seen some interpret her as Hispanic, but the only connection  I can see Is her crippling poverty.
Possibly a mix of asian-white or just full white honestly, we only ever see her mother sitting on the couch backwards and have no real idea of what the father is. Safe to assume the mother is white because of the sprite, but it would depend on Auberys father if she's a mix or full-white, and since we never see his sprite or any npc of him, it's a mystery.
Well in Memory Lane, Aubrey has Dark Brown hair, her mother has light brown hair and we don’t know about her dad but it’s safe to assume his hair is black. . So it’s a possibility that she could be mixed of White and Asian or just White
French
Mother looks white. Possible asian father, but we’ll never know. Gonna go with White, possibly half asian as the final answer.
Idk why this reminded me of Camp Buddy..
She's clearly African American
Nah aubrey white man
This is a really strange question...
Albanian 🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🇦🇱🦅
Wait, isn't Hispanic the same as white?
Auby is turkish cCc (joke)
At least it not another post about green flower boy
Maybe she's black?
Latino hispanic?
She is an Eggplant
White but that isn't what matters. They're true americans, sons and daughters of our beloved nation. 
Dude, they all look the same.
Persia or middle eastern?
shes auby!
Shes Jewish
white 💀
Auby = purple (aubregine or thanos, you decide lol)
What if she's wasian? Or a dark haired white? Or middle eastern...?
Auby is Southern European. . Bagel is Balkan (my headcanon). . the rest is obvious
Shes pink
Auby is an AUBERGINE
I thought  Aubrey was Korean????
aubrey = aubergine —> french. aubrey = french. . (it’s why aubrey carries around an eggplant plushie)
She is an eggplant
I say white bc Brown hair.
Italian
She’s cute, that’s what she is
Asian I mean ig because of her eyes
Light skin color, preferably lighter than Asians, I am one my self, now, she looks like a Hispanic, or white, but judging by her future appearance (after the, thing, that happened, idk how to put spoiler tags) she has blue eyes, which might be a sign that she is white, because there aren’t Asians that got blue eyes, but there are white and Hispanic people like that, so aubrey is one of those two.
She's British, she just hides her accent.
Awesome cosplay!
Thank you so much !🥰🥰🥰
Gorgeous! Aubrey's look suits you so well! And your poses and expressions make it even better. Great job!
Oh my god thank you so much ! I can't wait to show more pictures with the baseball bat🥰🥰
Yes!!! I'll be looking out for them! 
OH MY GOODNESS, YOU MADE THE BAT TOO?! IMPRESSIVE!!!
Thank you ! But I didn't make it tho, it's just a regular bat😭❤
You nailed it! (Get it? Nailed it? Like her nailed bat? Why are you all booing me?)
I'm not booing you lmao😭🤣 It was a good one even though I don't have the bat yet and it probably won't have nails for security purposes🤣 But thank you very much for the compliment ! I'm all ears for any advices you got !
Foam nails?
I don't know if I cant put those on because I'm literally borrowing a real bat 😭
Ohh… damn… ah well… (but what if foam nails and scotch tape so it can easily come off?)
Why not, I'll think about it🤔 Thank you !
. . what
Ummm I think your Reddit just crashed lmao😭😭
HAHAHA
Best Aubrey cosplay LMAO BAHAHAHAHAH
lmao what
LMAOO
Is this arbys?
looks amazing!

Wicked, you pull it off great!
Thank you so much, that's so nice !❤🥰 Which pic is the best ?
I like 4 because you're smiling, but 5 definitely has the best Aubrey Energy.
Oh really ? Thank you for your opinion !❤ I will try to make more of these expressions for my future pics ! Sorry to bother you but what makes it better in the last picture ? :3
Hand on the chin, a mildly annoyed, mildly bored look. The Aubrey classic.
Okay thank you ! I'll keep that in mind 🥰❤❤
Thankfully these werent the comments I expected
Why do I feel like it has something to do with my skin colour lmao🤣🤣
It's a wacky world, u were aubrey for this! The vibes were caught, idk why they expected bad comments cuz u executed well!!
Awe thanks !❤✨ That's so nice of you to say :3
Reddit comment threads have a 50% chance of being racist
I’m confused, what were you expecting?
Well you see some people are racist and hate when someone who isn’t the exact ethnicity of a character cosplays that character.
tbh I was thinking abt pervy comments lmao
Same.
Are you wearing coloured contact lenses?
Yup ! :3
Ooooh they look so nice on you 💞
Thank you so much !❤❤

Hell yeah, black Aubrey is real !😎😎 But thank you so much for the compliment !❤🥰
Oh wow, that cosplay is great!. . *sorts by controversial*
What does that mean ? :0
Because people who point out that your skin isn’t the same colour as Aubrey’s skin will get downvoted, and sorting by controversial let’s people see them more easily
Oh alright ! So what you mean by sorting by controversial is that you guys want to see these comment or downvote then ?
Sorts by the least amount of likes a comment has
Exactly what I did
me too
Me too
No bat, bad cosplay
Lmao😭😭😭 Don't worry, you'll get to see it soon !
Dont forget to nail it
I'll see about that 😂

Oh, i wont lie i do find that funny tho as long as it's done with good spirit. Ofc if ya rude with it than it's cringe

Block award by mod ? What does that mean ? But thank you so much for the compliment !❤❤
They mean that this post might get locked by the mods
Y?
Thankfully as far as I know most Omori players are left leaning
Looks amazing!! Did you make it yourself or does some magical cosplay store sell omori stuff? :0
Thank you so much !! And haha I wish😭❤ I didn't find the jacket anywhere and the ribbon was so hard to find so I took a basic one. I also bought a simple white jacket in which my close friend helped me sewing the sailor collar. He bought the yellow fabric to do so. And I kinda already had the rest (the skirt, the lenses, the socks and the shoes which aren't accurate lol)
I think it all looks great in composition! And props to you guys for making it yourselves, that takes some talent :3 good job
Thank you so much !❤❤❤❤ Props mostly go to my friend who actually sewed the whole thing, he is incredible !😭😭😭
Woah! You did a wonderful job on the clothing for your cosplay! Looks AWESOME! 
Thank you very much ! I really appreciate it !🥰❤
This is so good! Your expressions are perfect, she really suits you.
Thank you ! I can't wait to improve !❤❤❤
It's pretty perfect
Thank youuu !🥰🥰❤❤
Very good!! Pretty!
Amazing! Suits you so well :)
Tysm ! Love you😘❤
OH MY GODDDDDDD ITS AMAZING 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
THANK YOUUUUUU AAA❤❤❤
You look gorgeous, and these comments are surprisingly not that bad
Thank you ! And maybe it's because I'm like you said, gorgeous...hehehe❤❤🙈🙈🙈
If I’m being honest some of this doesn’t even look real, from how amazing it looks
Oh really ? That's really nice of you to say, I wonder if I deserve auch kindness😭😭❤❤❤
Oh trust me you do
Fish approved. . 
Omori made by Disney.. . . now, jokes aside, nice cosplay lol
Lmaoo ! I think I got the joke ! Are you referring to Disney trying to be inclusive like with the new little mermaid movie ? xD But thanks so much !❤
holy shit aubergine omori
Heheheh hell yeah
It does actually look really good, probably more accurate than a ton of other ones I’ve seen 👍
Awe thanks it's really nice of you to say !🥰❤
Wow, that cosplay is perfect! You’re so pretty!

No bat, 0/10
Wow that's so mean😭 Wait until I get the bat and get into your house to break your windows😈
It better have nails in it!
It will have blood on it too
Is don’t see any baseball bat 
Why would she need one if she's home ?🤔
To kill monsters under the bed

Girl you look amazing!!
Great cosplay! I love it! <3 and thankfully there’s only a handful of comments that are awful, I expected the whole comment section to be like that but thankfully I was wrong
Thanks ! I didn't expect to get that much recognition either😂
You did because your cosplay is awesome :)
9/10 needs a baseball bat
Thanks ! And don't worry, it'll be there soon
Oh my goodness! I just saw you on the SaikiK sub! You’re gorgeous!
Thank you that's so cute🥰❤ I do many cpsplays haha
You look amazing! The cosplay is genius, and by the way you are glowing girl omg what is your skin routine 
Awww you're adorable 🥰🥰 I use a mask every night to make it soft and healthy and I use hydrating cream before applying the makeup !
Cool! Have a great day bro!!!
oooo ur pretty. . I’m going to >!eat you and the others now. pay up or else.!<
😰😰
love it!! [p.s. - don’t sort by controversial :( ]
What does that mean ?
with the comments on reddit posts, you can sort by controversial, but it’s all the typically rude, off topic and bad comments
Oh I see but how do I sort by controversial ?
the slider next to the three dots in the top right corner
Oh I just used it thank you ! It's not that bad haha, I expected more hateful comments to be honest x)
Please don't push me into the lake 
Hehe
Nice, you pulled it off amazingly.
baseball bat where? 
im so glad the comments are civil
This is one of the few cosplays that looks good in real life.
THIS IS THE FIRST OMORI COSPLAY I'VE EVER SEEN- it looks beautiful btw
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it !❤✨
You're welcome! I bet you're beautiful without the cosplay too😃
Aaah not really but tysm !🥰🥰❤❤
Everyone's beautiful in their own way
Bro said: 
is the jacket made for an aubrey cosplay or does it just fit that well?
Awe thanks, I thought people would see it was actually a simple white jacket on which I painted the sleeve and my friend sewed the sailor collar on it. x) But yeah, they don't sell the jacket anywhere unfortunately, you have to make it yourself😭❤
wow, i didn't even notice that lol. it looks awesome
Damn, why on Earth you look so fine ?!
Omg thankss !❤❤ It makes my heart flutter✨
The pink hair fits you very well!
Thank you so much ❤🥰
They thought they could post picture of Aubrey from in game and get away with it 
🤣🤣

Omg thanks !!❤❤✨✨ Do I deserve such kindness ?😭
Yes ofc!

Dayum. That is a crazy cosplay

Looks amazing! Did you make the jacket yourself or did you buy it? I'm looking to make a Aubrey cosplay too
Thanks ! 🥰 I actually bought what you call a "bomber". Basically, I bought a cheap white jacket for like 8 dollars and then my friend bought a yellow fabric for like 3 dollars and he sewed a sailor collar on it. I also painted the sleeves and the ends of the jacket in yellow, We spent all afternoon on it lmao🤣 but I'm happy about the results. 🥰
You both did an excellent job for sure. Thank you for the technique!
Thank you and no problem ! Can't wait to see your Aubrey cosplay !🥰

It Is very Good 😊👍🏻

THIS IS SOO COOL 
Im impressed, its a really good cosplay

AH GORGEOUSSS

Sick cosplay

COOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
love seeing other black cosplayers!!!! GO GIRL!!!
WOAH WHAT THE  . . . Aubrey just got prettier what happened hello??????  . . . sorry anyway lol it's a great cosplay !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so cool and swag and VRRRRRr sorry anyway
Omg thank you so much🥰🥰❤❤❤
ofc! 
She litterally said ""
Yup
That looks sick!  . any advice on how to find the headband or jacket (the only jacket I can find iS 150$ and I cant find the headband at all )
Thank you ! Don't worry, I had the same problem xD You have to get yourself a cheap white bomber and craft the yellow collar yourself, then for the headband, you can find a green fabric and wrap it around your head into tie !
Cool!
Thanks 😘❤
it looks really good !
Thank you so much !🥰❤
You need a baseball bat
Yeah I know and I'll get it soon !🥰
You look gorgeous 
Thanks !❤❤❤❤❤
No problem im just stating the truth! :)
So nice and adorable🥰🥰❤❤❤
Only missing a bat! very cute ☺️
Awe thank you ! Don't worry, the bat is coming soon !❤❤
Really epic!. . Watch out for kids with knifes and basketballs
Thanks !❤ And don't worry, I'll have my baseball bat soon
So beautiful! How did you get the jacker? Did you make it up? Because looks so close to the original one omg omg ✨✨✨
Awww thank you that's so adorable ! Actually, I bought a cheap white jacket for 8 dollars and my friend helped me. He bought the yellow fabric for like 3.50 dollars and he sewed the fabric on the jacket to make the sailor collar. I painted the sleeves !
You're welcome \^-\^ . . &#x200B;. . Ooo, noice! I wanna make a cosplay too, I tried Sunny but I can't find a black school vest like his anywhere </3 guess I'll have to buy the one that ist closest the most. I also wanna do an Aubby cosplay, I've got the skirt (gotta use belt, im too skinny lmao), I would just need the top, the massive drip tennis and the jacket, which I might make according to how you said you did it :P. . Oh and also I've gotta get a wooden baseball bat, maybe I can use it for more stuff apart from Auby cosplay hehehehehehe...
Oh I see ! But you can look the vest on cheap shops like Shein or Aliexpress ! I'm pretty sure you'll find one ! And btw, even if it doesn't look exactly like the character's, it will still look alike ! I've seen many Aubreys with different bow colors, different jackets lenghts etc but they pretty much look like Aubrey. . . I'm actually going to borrow my friends baseball bat but as I said, it doesn't really looks like Aubreys one. It's not in wood and doesn't have nails on it xD But it's still a baseball bat lol and that makes me cosplay Aubrey in a unique way !. . (Don't tell anyone but the skirt I use for Aubrey is like 8 years old lmaoo)
Pffffff okay x). . Welp, gonna search that vest online, cus physical there's just no way lmao
Slay queen
You slaaayyy toooo !💅🏾✨❤😘
Afro American Aubrey???????!!!!!!1111
Hehe✨❤ Actually, I'm not American I have African origins but I was born (and live) in France !😘❤
Wow so pretty!!!
Tysm❤❤
AUBY OMORI REAL ‼️‼️
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|upvote)
Now you just need a bat with nails
sorting by controversial with a bag of popcorn
0/10 no baseball bat with nails
Ate and left no crumbs
OBSESSED
Nice cosplay, you really nailed it!
This is an amazing cosplay 👍
YOU'RE SO CANON OMG
Thanks😘❤
Just missing the spiked baseball bat and angry face.
Nice cosplay + pink looks super good on you !
Thank you ❤😭
Good shit but a spiked bat would tie it together
well well well here is the real criminal
Netflix done adaptating Omori
Heck yeah... Watch out for the trailer😘
Most controversial comment. Congratulations.
Aubrey but Netflix/j. Anyways real cool cosplay
hollywood be like:. . "making original stories with non white leads is too hard, just replace our white characters to add to our diversity quota". . Edit: y'all can downvote me all you want but I didn't lie though, race swapping functionally is rebranded tokenism on the part of these studios and I'm tired of pretending it's not
Nobody cares about your rant it's just a cosplay
this is how an omori netflix adaptation would look like i swear
This joke was actually made 4 times here unfunny ass mf
yeah don't piss yourself
add drugs and sex and swearing to make it more "mature and adult"
what
what
what
What
is there a lore reason why I got downvoted for saying what??????
why did the reddit hive mind downvoted you? are they stupid?
it kinda makes sense if you say what like youve seen dogshit drop from  the sky
yes but i was making a joke. . 
. . Why did this guy think he could make a joke on reddit? Is he stupid?
I think the reddit hive mind thinks your racist
You're gonna get downvoted so bad for this 😔
Was it another racist comment? :/
Yes sadly😔 Thankfully it got removed but it's not like it was an uncommon thing, I got used to it ever since I started cosplaying. People will criticize you for the slightest things.😔
Oh damn I’m sorry :(
Overall it looks great one big problem in my opinion is that the hair is not pink enough at least in the photos it should be more of a hot pink color but other than that slight nit pic it looks awesome
"Nip pic" ?💀
I pray he meant nitpick…
Same💀
It was a typo
i hope your pillow is always warm
What do you mean ?
it's a "rare" insult, since i didn't like how he was criticizing you and then claiming a "nip slip" when there was nothing close to it. i thought your cosplay was amazing!
Oh I see, thank you ! But it's okay don't worry🥰🥰
Btw, congratumations. You're the third openly racist comment of the day ! Do you want a candy ? :3
What is racist in Aubrey isn't a nice person 🤨
Oh really ? :3 Interesting
:3
I don't c-
Btw, congratulations. You're the third openly racist comment of the day ! Do you want a candy ? :3
Something something absent father joke
I normally like honest opinions, but this one looks like you're just trying to make me feel insecure for no reason and well, it doesn't work.. My face is completely normal and I don't see any problems with it🥰
Wasn't trying for anything, just saying what I thought. You do you.
Of course ! And you do you as well🥰 Have a nice day
"Black person looks like someone attempting to look like a black person". . lmao slap yourself
She gon be black today😘😘
so?
Can we get a mod to delete this 10 year olds comment?
Tf happened? Y’all just unaware that cosplayers do blackface?. . I was just saying how with the thickness of the makeup it made me think that OP was doing blackface for some reason and it took me a bit to figure out that’s not the case
So using makeup just like everyone is called blackface now huh🤔 Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for enlighting me, you're so smaaart🤪
I ain’t say that, just the way the makeup looks on you and the thickness of it is similar to when a lot of cosplayers do blackface. . That’s why I said I initially thought this was blackface until I realized Aubrey isn’t a black character so someone doing blackface to look like her is weird as fuck and prolly not the case. . Maybe it’s the lighting causing that effect, idk, just something about the makeup and the way it looks if it was being done by a white person would look exactly like modern blackface
Okay whatever, it's your opinion and I won't judge that. But since it's about me, I think it is irrelevant because I did my makeup properly, it doesn't look anything like weird, maybe you're just seeing things whatsoever but I'm confident, since I've been practicing makeup for more than a year, that there's nothing wrong with it ! . . Maybe I somewhat have white people's facial features that makes you think it's blackface (I honestly wonder how) but it's not ! And why did you talk about my skin colour in the first place ? You could've talked about more relevant things like saying there's a problem with my jacket, that maybe I should do certain expressions etc but no, my skin colour had to be the main subject.. . But now that it's settled, please avoid bringing such irrelevant remarks, you will only be seen as a racist redditor. And I'm not the one assuming that, but the mods probably would.
1: There probably isn't anything wrong with your makeup but there's probably something wrong with the camera, lighting, filters, or really anything (a lot of cameras are notoriously bad at giving darker skin a splotchy look reminiscent of blackface which probably would've been ignored if cosplayers didn't have a... troubling history with blackface to say the least). . 2: To be honest I didn't really notice anything else that was wrong and this was the first thing that stood out to me as something that you might want to fix next time you cosplay. . . And I do think that this is a relevant remark because it probably indicates that you might want to spend some more time fixing up your photos to get rid of that affect so that the makeup looks more "integrated" with your face rather than sitting on top of it ig? I don't really know what that means but I hope you can catch what I'm saying. . Look, I didn't mean any harm and I was just pointing out an oddity with your cosplay that you might want to look at the reasoning behind it. Especially because if you're gonna start cosplaying as characters with melanin in them there's gonna be people who think you're genuinely trying to blackface and not bother to look through your account
And I don't care about what people say, I do my thing and that's it. Yeah thanks for you opinion or whatever but mine counts first ! Yeah there's probably a filter, I used lights and just like every cosplayer does ! Sorry for not having a 4000$ camera or the latest iphone to give off a better quality. I did my best and I'm proud. Imagine being me though, spending an entire day to craft your costume, assembling the outfit, putting on the makeup for some pics, taking an hour to get the best angles only for a random redditor to say you look like a blackface. --
For sure, I was tryna blackface even though I'm already black lololol🤪 Have fun getting your comment removed lol
I’m so sorry about him :/ he’s so annoying
Nah it's alright ! ❤🥰 I was kinda expecting it at some point lol
because
I’m glad it was removed then
What did the comment say?
"Why is aubrey black"
OH GOODNESS..
Crazy idea right? That a person would want to cosplay a character that technically isn't their race because they like the character? It's just silly, istg idpol gives people brainrot
Only thing missing is a baseball bat.
*sigh* "goes to controversial"
They've all been removed for a while now🤣
So cute! I love it 🥰
It looks awesome
love it
Beautiful~! 💜💜💜
PRETTY AS FUCK
Skin color doesn't match up and nose is too wide
And I oop-
love iiit
Why does Something have the Auby flair?
Because Auby

take the upvote and get out
Surprised Aubrey isn't gonna snap too
Auby :)
Based. I think her inclusion of how she acts in DW is reminiscent a bit to the past RW Aubrey.. . It's a bit weird how he fantasises about someone he hasn't met in 4 years but oh well.
He hasn't aged properly in 4 years I don't think concept of time exists for him
Yeah Aubrey was always the same I believe, she just became delinquent after being abandoned for 4 years. She tried her hardest to stay in touch but so much changed.
It's decently close to canon as its hinted at during the game that aubrey has a crush on sunny, and its clear that sunny at least used to have a crush her, so he might still have one. Also cuz it makes auby happy and when auby happy auby gaming
Pretty accurate, sadly we won't know for sure if it could be close to canon. I just pray for another really good Sunburn fic as I'm dying for one lol.. . Jokes aside I like it and respect it enough. Also Auby gaming 
Personally not a fan, as I just dislike real world Aubrey as a character. I'm also just not a fan of "rebel/delinquent" archetypes.
>not a fan of "rebel/delinquent" archetypes.. . Based, too much media focuses on quirky deliquent characters like they're pleasant people or have any impact on the world when they don't.. . But I don't dislike Aubrey personally because being a hooligan isn't her entire character and I assume that after the gang reunites she snaps out of it.
That's fine too! Personally I couldn't get over her actions towards her old friends, but to each their own of course:)
I think it was used pretty well but I understand that it's not for everyone
In the game, it feels like it’s just a one sided crush Sunny has on Aubrey. I mean one of the stories in the lost library is about Sunny liking Aubrey, and Aubrey is obsessed with omori in his dreams, but when you get to the real world, nothing really happens. . . The only “signs” she likes him too is caring about his health by asking if he’s eating enough, and asking to stay in contact/visit soon. I feel like friends would do that anyway and it’s nothing special. The ship is cute in theory, but I don’t think it would actually happen.
I think what your missing is quite simple, Aubrey had been abandoned for so long she grew apathetic but compassionate of her friends, she has every right to act the way she does, when she sees Sunny she is startled, she hadn't seen him in 4 years and can gather she missed him as per the Swing Sequence where she apologises and says "Sometimes I feel like i should of been the one there for you" She feels bad for leaving him being malnourished and all for so long, she even contemplates about the past and how she can try to get over Mari with enough time.. . DW Aubrey is different because it's based on Sunny as a kid, not her now. I think that's important to note. RW Aubrey has changed but she's still the same kind, sweet girl she was always in the past. Just... she's altered due to her new appearance and friends.
No full stop. Aubrey has no right whatseoever to react the way she did in the game. And again im with the original commentor. I think that swing scene is very platonic. I doubt shed be confessing feelings like that the day after she bullied us and nearly killed Basil
I just don't like Aubrey
>I just don't like Aubrey. . 
Yo dude, the based department is calling you rn
I'll say it's based but personally I just think Aubrey is a well written and lovely character *^(yes i know she bullied basil but that aside she's really unique)*
Yes, unique is a way of describing her
Why? I don't see a reason to dislike her. (People downvoting without giving an actual reason, never change Reddit)
i mean they definitely aren't BAD bad. And as characters they're well written. but theres plenty of reason to think "i dont agree with how they handled this and dont like them very much". Personally i UNDERSTAND why aubrey turned out how she did, but i kinda resent bullies and those real world segments really made me hate aubrey (although i sorta changed my mind later on of course)
I like her, but I can more than understand why people would hate her. Some people just hate bullies, which I get.
Because everyone wants to be loved, and since he had a crush on her, Omori made Aubrey in love with him (I think she was the only girl he knew)
I think the reason I don’t like this ship is because the Aubrey that Sunny is in love with isn’t the same as current Aubrey. Aubrey has drastically changed after everything while he stayed locked away in his room. . . Also we’re never given any indication that Aubrey had a crush on him as a kid. So it seems more one sided. . . I think part of Sunny healing and moving on from everything (rather then hiding away in his fantasy world). Is accepting who Aubrey is now and moving on from his crush.. . Also I headcanon that Aubrey is a lesbian. . . Note: I don’t care if people ship it! It’s just not for me personally.
You missed the entire point of Aubrey then, she's the same kid who hides behind a facade of anger, Sunny breaks her shell in literally 3 days.
"Sunny breaks her shell in literally 3 days". . No, that was Hero. He's the one who made Aubrey see the error of her ways and reconcile with the others. If it wasn't for him, Aubrey would still be sulking in her room and resenting her old friends.
Like --> it's cute and auby tsundere +canon points. Dislike --> its TOO cute
I never understood the ship but I replayed the game and got to the couch that was in front of the sun and then saw Aubrey rest her head on Omori's shoulder and instantly just understood why people shipped these two.
After the reveal I think it's impossible, as I feel like Aubrey has the greatest change of a very negitive reaction
Yeah i mean Aubrey beats us up and we stab her so i cant imagine it being still a thing
the dynamic and overall ship is really cute   . the only thing i dislike is probably aubrey lol
Yeah it's not for everyone, the ship is incredibly dynamic overall though. Only problem will be is how others to react to this ship since it creates alot of controversy due to her past actions.
Aubrey 
Yeah and i dont even really ship Kimbrey that much but its obvious thats Aubreys now. I mean Kim knew where Aubrey was, when i dont think anyone else knew, Kim was super worried for her when she didnt come out. . . Another thing i dont like about it is that Mari was very sisterly/motherly to Aubrey and to me then shipping Aubrey with Maris brother feels weird. But there is evidence and it is a cute ship. . . And yeah ill see the occasional Suntan and the rare Cactiflower and i like them just fine
I think what rubs me the wrong way when it comes to the Kimbrey ship is how inadvertently Aubrey turned the hooligans into punk-like buffoons. I wish it didn't happen and there were ways around it.. . And yeah it could seem a bit odd that Aubrey WOULD date Sunny since she saw Mari is a mother/sister figure. But yeah there's still evidence to it despite the circumstances.
I used to think it was a little one sided until I remembered in headspace Omori practically reveals he’s aware of Aubrey liking him. He also sends the heart when they do a chain attack. 
Uhm well i see Aubrey as a lesbian so I really don’t like that ship at all
why do you see her as a lesbian (genuine curiosity). i never really saw it tbh
not the same person but she shows no interest in guys and i refuse to call her relationship with kim purely platonic
She doesn't show any interest in girls either though 
Real.
Because I can't not see Aubrey as a lesbian. That picture with Kim is very gay and I'm all about it. I mean, it's not Sunny Aubrey's holding bridal style in official art.... . Edit : Man, I miss when you could say something gay in this subreddit and not get downvoted...
Wtf is gay about a fist bump lmao
I'm just saying they look like really good friends. Roommates, if you will.
I just hate to see bottom Auby so that mean im ok with Aubrey x Sunny, not Sunny x Aubrey. Still, mostly i hate sunburn
auby just aubys the snuuy also does aubys and auby is snuuy
Well, they are my 2 favorites characters so, yea. And i think they are great together.. . ( Aubrey is really cute )
I don’t like Aubrey
It’s adorable, both in fanon and canon. Don’t know what more can be said.. . . Also aubrey is ho-
I think it’s really cute when they were young and in hs, but aubrey ends up bullying his best friend when they’re older. that’s quite a turn-off.
The fact that there’s a chance sunny doesnt like Aubrey anymore or that Aubrey never had feelings for him 😭
Dayum, that hits hard
It has been four years Spongethebob, Krusty Krabs has been closed, don't you remember?
Yes, after Patrick killed himself nothing's been the same
Squidward is still in that building, who knows why?
Traumatized to the state of pure apathy
So is this when [SB-129]() takes place? Is this whitespace?
Its sad seeing someone who was once such a ball of sunshine and happiness be reduced to a delinquent and hide away her true feelings. Basil said that Aubrey was always true to herself, yet in the real world she was not being true to herself at all. Really shows how hard Mari's death and the separation of the group hit her.
if im spongebob i would run
Spongebob is a karate master remember?
he couldn't even lift a marshmallow
But he didn’t even feel Flats punching him. In fact I think it even tickled him if memory serves
SpongeBob is like a character that cant die but is so weak when attacking
SpongeBob didn't succumb
*will not
\*did not
oh boy you're in for a suprise then,
i'm not, i spoiled myself but it wouldn't be correct here
Well, will not instead of did not, because , he really is way past the point of having gone down, under normal circumstances
So what you're saying is Spongebob is >!Aubrey's OMORI!< here? okay sounds good
Did you manually crop and reanimate 3 frames here or are there freely available transparent Omori assets? Because if there are, I want them.
I got everything from the wiki (Besides SpongeBob.. unless?)
This is one of the best edits I've seen on the sub, gg man

This is really well made like seriously good job
Thank you! I had to put in extra effort because the photo frame SpongeBob is originally holding is not square so I had to adjust and fill in the border. Turned out nice in the end
dude good editing
Dear god, this is great.
this still hurts me
can you spoiler that, you can tell that >!it's the battle style and that you fight her!<
Yes yes😔
Aubrey would laugh her ass off
shes waiting for OMORI
Look at her face . So determination.
This literally looks like it's from actual game. Great job OP
much thanks yo :)
(・｀ω´・) Doodled by: me
For a second i thought this were taken from game. "Insane drawing skills" that's all i'm gonna say
hehe much appreciated :D
god i wish that were me. . aubrey, not mr. plantegg
Yeah being whacked that hard would hurt
I love it when OMORI artists do the extra stills to give it the scribbly animation like in the game. You got a twitter I can retweet this from? 'Cause it's great.
I don't have a twitter, but I have an instagram account. I use the same name there.. . many thanks btw
My baby 🥺
Kawaii~
Amazing job!

Good bot
This art just gave you a follow:D
She's adorable.
This looks so good! But it also made me a bit sad :(
they’re so cute sniff
Omg thank u I set this as my lockscreen💜 if that's okay?
sure, no problems here
New lock screen, thanks:D
Aubrey looks a bit smug XD
auby!
I WILL ADOPT HER IF ITS THE LAST THING I DO
I sense a hollow knight reference here
aubrey has a pet bunny in her room in 1 day left iirc
I see. Since Sunny’s holding it, I guess that he and Aubrey are closer now.
Judging from OPs other post, yes. . 
Op didn’t make this art or the other art
I give link to the artist,you can check out more
Yea but they linking it and thinking that this and that other post are connected in some way
Ah...I just want people to see the old post those,if someone miss it.(Btw this my ideal that is Aubrey get a gift but yeah it’s not connected so no need to concerned.)
[Artist ](). . Aubrey [Gift ]()
Holy shit bun-bun aaaaah. . This is so cuuute everyone is so cute my bi-instincts are gonna hurt me
So. Many. Party hats.
take my free award of this day. thank you
Bruh this is so damn cute, I love it!
So many cute fan-arts!
awh the big seventeen
STOP ALL THEIR HAIR IS SO FLUFFY AND I LOVE IT 😭
What’s that thing at the bottom right?. . ~~abomination~~
**More like perfection**
StrAubrey
Aww this is adorable!! Its so good to see the old gang back together
omori
that is so precious I can't-
wholesome
My fucking heart
To be fair I think it's more sus that if you interact with Aubrey's bed, you just get the text, "Aubrey's bed..."
I don't think it's a coincidence that HS Aubrey starts flirting with Omori a ton right after Sunny sees Aubrey for the first time in four years.
Yeeeeaaaah
I remember hero saying we have never been in aubreys house
Actually Sunny has been in Aubreys room before, in the >!hikki route when you rescue basil, Aubreys bed is identical to the one in her irl room.!< plus he knows that Aubreys pet bunny is called bun bun, further cementing this.
AUBREY NO-
AUBREY YES~
**OH FUCK**

Yeah, that's prob cause he's been against Aubrey all of the time and all the kids seem to be on Aubrey's side
lmao. damn I really wanted to see the canon reaction, but I bet it would have been something similar to this. no way, Aubrey would just accept it and hug both of them. she was the character I felt most bad for. this summer break will be probably worse than the one when she lost her og friends.
Aubrey be hitting the table with kitchen utensils
I wonder what Aubrey would think of this version of Sunnny
[this emote right here]()
i cant see it sorry
oof, that sucks, ig you need to join the server lmao
aubrey art pls. i want her to step on me too
The sunglasses >>>
Wait I think I commented a little too much
Bro did it all in 1 minute too
Clam down. . 
It's the best artwork 

Banger art 
Brazilian Miku when she Aubrey ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|surprise)
Brazilian:
It's been 4 years, I JUST realized why Aubrey's toy is an eggplant out of all things.
Why?
Aubergine is a term for eggplant
It's also just how British people say it lol, everyone calls it an aubergine here
Ohh
Because she likes eggs and veggies?
It's because eggplants are also called aubergines.. Like, AUBERgines.
Thats rad.
Probably? Idk what first comment guy realized
OH MY GOD.
Aubrey really enjoyed it when it's Sunny outside
Nice artwork
what’s up with this recent trend
One person drew a Brazilian Miku, and it became popular
Excellent work pal!
Love the green
First Brazillian Basil (HE SERRRRBBBBB FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE) and now we got Brazillian Aubrey (SHE IS ARGENTINIAN FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK PERON FUCK USTASHE FUCK USTASHE wait....)
Well done art piece! 🙂👍🏻


Nuh uh
it’s the revengeance
Holy shit this fucking amazing omfg
This ate I'm dying 
It’s spreading
Great art! Though I don't really understand why there's so much Brasilian character art around, you did a great job 👍🏻👍🏻 
Brazilian Hatsune Miku coming back to Twitter in a "disguise" :
I love it, good work 🇧🇷🧉
While I understand the reference I think it could have been better to choose an adult like Polly instead of a 16 years old girl.
Yeah, that drawing seems a little too sexualized to me.
Considering that the outfit of brazilien miku was meant to be the representation of a latino milf, it's normal that this is sexualized notably with string of the panty visible. Aubrey is not only too young for that type of outfit but it's also not her type too wear that or being happy like that. . . . This outfit would fit better with Polly since she is an adult and has a brown skin which can make it feel she is latino.
Surely we can't go out in swimming suit; I know this isn't the case, but still goes beyond the limits of decency imo, at least where I live. If in Brasil this is the standard and everyone is adjusted to it there's no problem I guess.
Yeah, I was talking about that, she's way too young to dress like that.
Everyone has it's opinion on the matter and yes, not only I found this outfit inapropriate given Aubrey's age but this is also not in link with her personnality.
"her character is being a rebellious teen" Wow what an incredibly deep understanding you have of the game's characters this is such a great argument.
Let just say the original material of where the characters was based was supposed to be for sexy latino milf, Aubrey while rebellious is certainly not an latino smilling girls, I have no problem with others opinion but I think the outfit is too sexualizing for Aubrey and this is not about the crop tops.
Yup, sad that this is always the young member of the gang that people always pick on for that. I also admit that seing mommy Polly in this outfit would have been a pleasent view not gonna lie.
I'm not gonna lie, many br teens dress kinda like that sometimes, partially bc it's a hot place and the other part bc idk it's common enough, teens like to act like adults ig
Ngl, I never seen adults dress like that in real life, maybe just in beaches.
rio de janeiro. . . . and as I said teens over 14 can dress kinda like that in some places, in town/cities with beaches/pools they're everywhere. every store I go there are shorts that short and they're almost priority, crop tops aren't that much of a rare sight. teens and young adults are usually the ones who use those, especially in hot places. . this is probably more of a brazil thing, I guess? bc I've seen them many places through all my life. some people will judge, but they indeed exist, and are not as sexualized and rather normalized as it is a common sight in some places
If they're normalized there there's nothing wrong, I guess.
I see your points and this is probably a culture difference but this is still an outfit who was supposed to be sexualizing for  adult which I find not to be for underaged girls, there's also the fact that the legal age of consent in Brazil is 16 which clearly contrast with many country.
ngl I can't see it, also what's of the age of consent? we still see 16 as underage
In many country, 18 but in Brazil and some country it's 16, in France it's even 15.
not what I meant
Didn't you ask me what's the age of consent?
I asked what's WITH the age of consent. we're not talking about dating or anything, it's about clothing picks. in really hot places people won't care much when someone doesn't want to be boiled alive
Ah sorry for that, I just think that Brazilien are more leniant to that because of the age of consent but maybe this is just me.
I don't think it's only about the heat, I don't think a man would wear that kind of clothing, not even in Brazil.
bc men are taught it's weird to use short shorts, and yet they use it sometimes. plus many older men can be shirtless and boy can I tell you their beer bellies are plenty visible on the outside of their houses sitting on a chair, and in places with public swimmable water. just don't enter premises or (obviously) go to your job shirtless ig, maybe in some bars, especially in small towns. these clothes are decent enough bro, they won't arrest u for that, maybe some old ppl talking shit about u but as long as ur not just ugly or nearly naked it should not be a problem
She got a lot of Sun 
Ive realized now that i can simp for her all i want since we're literally the same Age. I got 2/3 years worth of Aubrey simping Left then it's over
this you?
Naw Bru i'm on that enemies to lovers grind yk? 
Hear you loud and clear.
Good for you, but after that, you can have a seat.
Dang bro never thought of it like that
She's so pretty
awww she's awesome!!!

Pika
BRAZIL NUMBER ONE 🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
First Brazilian Basil now Aubrey  can't wait for Brazilian Sunny
A question I would like to know because I'm not from Brazil. Do Brazilian people actually wear less clothing than normal, or is it another reason that I'm seeing every brazilian fan art with fewer clothes?
I mean, it's South. Noone wears full clothing on south. It's too hot.
Even in winter?
There's no "winter" there, in the classic sense.
Listen; just in fricking miami, you dont wanna wear full clothing (pants, long sleeve shirts❌, shorts, t-shirts ✅), or you will become toast. I cant imagine in brasil, closer to the equator, and with no winters
Thanks for the explanation! 😊  . ^(but how did you find this post and comment after 7 months?)
^(between us, I saw a different post leading me to this post)
^(good job finding me then)
^((quiet yippee sounds))
The hair transition really brings it all together
THE BRAZILIAN MIKU HAS FOUND EVEN AUBY😭😭
THE DETAILS, I CAN'T, IT'S TOO GOOD

Would.


. . QUICK, THE BIG MOLIO OF INNOCENCE, I WILL STAY SAFE IF IT IS IN EFFECT
Pfft.
Brasil numero uno!!!! campeao mundo!!!  🇧🇷 🇧🇷 🇧🇷
very cute! (´ω｀\*)
Am I the only one who thinks it's really gross to be drawing child characters in overly sexualized ways? Like she's 12-16 for most of the game she does not need to be pictured with a thong out in a crop top ?????
this great much better than my art
you’re still learning, don’t compare it like that💖
comparison is the thief of joy
So it been 7 months, how is your art?
i've improved alot. . 


As a Brazilian thank you this is incredible
Outro brasileiro por aqui?

could anyone explain this trend
Long story short, brazillian miku and then everyone copied it into their fandoms
I wasn't expecting it to spread this much lol
where are her clothes
Bazil would have love this
Love love love!
The outfit doesn't seem the most... whatever. Suppose these things being inflated by the demographies they are meant for is noticeable at times, that much is for certain.
This is GORGEOUS . . . And also I'm dying over that hair gradient, the pink and the teal/mint look SO GOOD FAM

Fbi:. . 
Isn’t Aubrey like 17 during the game? This art feels kind if weird tbh
As a brazilian, I can confirm she's just dressed like any other brazilian girl of her age would
Ur the weird one 
Literally how? This is clearly suggestive
Why? I just feel like this sort of outfit seems inappropriate for a 17 year old
I do agree that teens should wear less revealing clothes but they still wear stuff like this, especially in hot countries. I say for drawings 16 is a thin like of just about not weird for something like this
Idk man. This seems a little too much „less clothing“
Yeah i guess its cuz they were copying the clothing miku had, I'd prefer aub had altered versions of her own clothing. But its not intentionally making things weird.
i hate this trend so much
himitsu dayo ?
holy fucking shit  . . . racist aubrey
Thats what I thought!
based aubrey
Aubrey's personality "burns"
Mr Plantegg has enacted his revenge and turned Auby into a marketable plush 
From this point forward I will believe that the size difference in the picture is the accurate size difference between them in the game.
She uses it as a weapon their was never any doubt about it
Oh yeah I know. However in my head Mr plantegg will always be twice Aubrey’s size now
Omori au where plantegg uses aubrey plush to fight
bot.
Official Aubrey plush!!!! Aaaaaaaa. . . This means we are likely getting plush of all the friends . . . . My wallet hurts

La Lombarda Aubrey 
Non è vero, Aubrey tipica Napoletana che va in giro con la mazza chiodata.
No lei è una Lombarda Maranza
Aaaa allora si spiega tutto
Mh ci può stare però secondo me é una tipica maranza bolognese
Ma no raga, Aubrey e gli hooligans sono i classici maranza di Riccione.
Ma lei mi sta freebootando la battuta dell'esimio signor u/SASm4n
I don’t know how but I can understand you without a translator
Really? I speak spanish (Which have the same roots) and I only really understood something about mental health.
I don't know how you did because that's as far as it could be from what I said
I speak spanish too and is just a matter of comprehension try reading it many times

Unexpected fratelli d’italia
In Aubrey's headspace, the land is ruled by Queen Mari, and her brother, prince Sunny. Then, [insert headspace character] kidnaps prince Sunny! So Aubrey must team up with her friend Basil, prince Hero of a neighbor kingdom, and prince Kel. Along the way, she becomes allies with the headspace versions of the Hooligans. Gameplay wise, it would be like Paper Mario 64, with Aubrey's friends being the partners.
uh sir im gonna need a fanfiction of this stat
Give me some time, maybe a week. I need to come up with headspace characters
take your time send me a link when its done.

auby gaming moment
my headcanon is that aubrey is hapa
wait, what was the original for aubrey?
Aubrey hate club opening
I have been saying Aubrey is Italian since forever!!! Take my upvotes.
Aubrey’s mom’s light brown hair is more common in peoples whos heritage traces back to Britain, Central Europe and Scandinavia. Aubrey as a name originally derived from Norman (English) heritage, but its so popular that probably doesnt mean much. . . Aubrey’s most defining trait is that she’s extremely pale. Take a look at the other images of her with her friends. She calls Sunny pale, but is even lighter then him in the hugging cut scene. She’s easily the most pale of all characters. But sadly, we dont have enough data yet to make any conclusions about her father from this alone. Black is an extremely common hair color and pale could be any east asian, non-mediterranean european or yes, even Italian (though probably north Italian and not south). . So TLDR: Aubrey heritage is probably half English/Scottish on her Mom’s side and half milk on her father’s side.
Nah bro she Aubrey
Wut do u mean, auby is auby it doesn't matter.

AUBREY UNA DI NOI! UNA DI NOOOOOOIII AUBREY È UNA DI NOOOOOOIII 
i found out it was aubreys birthday yesterday night... i have never drawn so fast
Well it doesn't matter what day it is,it still very good piece of art
thank you :)
love your style keep drawing the art is really good.
thanks so much!
Wonderful.

Cute! Which font is that?
It’s the omori game font, I downloaded it from the files, it’s easy to do :)

Amazing drawing
thanks :)
No problem. Keep up the good work
wake up
Aw :3
Aubs!
Am i the only one who's missing it? When did Aubrey mansioned she have a crush on Sunny. BTW. Please don't say "headspace" because it's Sunny's ideal world and he wants Aubrey to love him, because you can tell for sure that Sunny have a crush on Aubrey
this actually wasnt meant to be a ship-y (?) drawing at first, but people have interpreted it that way which I also don't mind haha. you can also just see it as aubrey being happy a friend surprised her for her birthday :)
Amazing
Hey, it's pretty nice.. . &#x200B;. . ... I wonder why i go check old posts.

Wheres Aubrey when you need her ?

aubrey: ***aggressive flirting***
Aubrey's way too emotionally fucked up for aggressive flirting. Awkwardly trying to convey her care like a dork is more her game.
Dang.... Guess Aubrey got rejected
Aubrey aggressively asks if you've heard of our lord and savior Jesus Christ
Aubrey would wear a long dress but that's just my opinion, a game opinion

no way the completely real aubrey from omori?!??!??
also 'and they were roommates' moment lol
wassup Aubrey from Omori. I'm Vegito from Dragon Ball
. . Aubrey x \[anyone\] fan when they see this (i'm one of them) :
except for aubrey x kim fans
There are dozens of us!
DoZENS! 
[don’t worry man]()
And they were roommates
^(oh my god they were roommates) 
XD
actually, historians said they were not only roommates, but they dressed up and traveled together 
And never married any men-
they were roommates, dressed up and traveled together, AND never married any men.. . wowwie 
>aubrey is a girl kisser. . damn she's just like me fr
new kin (i haven't kissed any girl in my life)
LOL
Well yea, we play OMORI
Nah bro i like MEN.
That doesnt look like Aubrey in the 1st pic. The hair is much shorter than Aubrey's, also it seems a little wavy. The girls are both wearing japanese uniform, as well as the other girl does not look like any omori character. So in conclusion the only thing that makes it look like Aubrey is the ribbon. Omocat's artstyle makes many characters look similar, so I wouldnt be surprised if it wasnt Aubrey. Id be cool to have comfirmation though
Yeah because it’s literally two completely different girls, neither of which are Aubrey or Kim lmao. . Omocat just has one of those art styles where it’s hard to tell the difference between characters with similar characteristics. But the other doesn’t even look **remotely** like kim in any way so using it for this ship is just goofy
it could be like early design Aubrey
You say it’s obviously a joke but how are they joking when they keep arguing that it’s actually Aubrey? Have you even seen how OP has talked about it?. . No joke is ever obvious on the internet unless OP specifically says whether that was their intention to be a joke or not.
Yeah now that I saw them say it they may not be. But I also realized it could actually still be early design aubrey, we don’t know.
It could also (much more likely) be omocat’s oc or self insert since she drew herself looking very similar to Aubrey in the past before Omori was finished.. . Also why’d you edit your first original reply to say something completely different? The context is confusing now, and would have been a good lesson to learn for anyone else reading, since a lot of people make that same mistake of assuming something is a joke without actually knowing if it is or not.
Eh they can assume that based on your reply. But it’s not completely different, I just deleted a part pf it.
Early design Aubrey looks completely differently
that's what i'm saying
Well i see How at a glance it could be mistaken fir aubrey same headband and thats one of aubreys most  noticeable features.
My bi queen
Bee queen
So freinds can't have pictures of each other?
Bro she making out with a chick 💀
It isn't in the game though?
When the creator draws it I think you’re aloud to make some assumptions
1. That isn’t any know character in said photo. 2. It’s hard to tell if that’s even auby
i'd say it's a little bit odd to frame a pic of you and your friend and put it by your bed, especially if you've known each other for like 4 years?
No its not especially someone that comes from a broken home like Aubrey. She and Kim are close no denying that but that doesn't mean they are in a relationship when the game shows zero evidence for it except for a picture that can be seen any way.
let me guess. you don't use that same logic for heterosexual ships, do you?
I said no evidence for them being in a relationship not her sexuality.
and i said i'm guessing.
The reading comprehension devil strikes again.
i think it struck both of us. can we do this again in a less snarky, more productive way?
What else needs to be said.
we could go over all the evidence at hand and go through it if you're on board with it? it doesn't have to be an argument with a winner.
What evidence? As I said there is nothing the confirms a relationship
THERE ARE ONLY 3 CANON SHIPS IN THE GAME, AUBREY IS IN NONE OF THEM
please do list them.
…in what way is this odd? ppl have pics of them and a friend (both same and opposite genders) in their room or as a lock screen/wallpaper all the time. and 4 years is more than enough time to grow close to someone, but like what does that even have to do w anything? my closest friend has known me for a shorter amount of time than most of my other friends. . . sometimes you just click w a specific friend more than others, time doesn’t play a factor in that. you don’t need to be childhood besties w a person to have pics of them in your room. . . honestly aubrey and kim might have something going on between them who knows, but i disagree that it’s “odd” to have a framed pic of you and a friend who you only see in a platonic way since like i said before it’s pretty common.

huh. never noticed that
I only see one girls kissing photo on there 
holy shit this comment section, if fucking knew it will be very Controversial
im not surprised, redditors freak out when they see a ship that isn't straight
This fandom forgets about bi & pan ppl exist, so im not even even surprised they only know lesbian,gay,and straight and they got triggered about this
*cease*
aha ! i shan't ! \*does a jolly little jig\*
She's but don't let this distract you from the fact that Aubrey canonically hates orange joe. 
Shippers when they forget that strong platonic relationships exist
Casually making out with the homies
Shippers when they only argue this way against gay ships
fuckin true though. I have never seen someone say this about ANY straight ship
these 'people cant be friends' people SOMEHOW never write these kinda stuff on posts about straight ships.
Yeah, Kim is just Aubrey's *special* friend.
Mfw this only gets said under gay ships

How can Aubrey be this gay and yet be so homophobic
self-love
Girl liker 
top left isn't aubrey tho
look at the girl on the right. ribbon, long hair, exact same jacket... it's definitely her.
the jacket is not the exact same. There's nothing on the back
Now, I know this is hard to understand for redditors, especially for those obsessed with Hikkikomoris, but most people actually do what's called "changing clothes" where they remove what they're wearing, and put on something entirely different. This is often done after a procedure called a "shower" but I won't overwhelm you with too much explaining all at once.
please explain to me what a shower is? it sounds quite frightening
Characters in omori tend to not change clothes much
maybe take a look at... all the other official art?
I am pretty sure every post-truth aubrey in official art doesn't change clothes except the merch art
homophobia detected in omori subreddit
that's not what you said, though. you're just amending your argument to be more specific upon being proven wrong.
if you don't mind I'm gonna go sleep now  I don't have energy for this shit
jesus christ, man. no need to get aggressive, we're having a discussion.
i'm not getting aggressive but ok
***???? then what was that just now????***
i beg to differ. also, since the post was made in 2014, it's very much plausible that such a small detail, like the back of her jacket might've changed in development.. . 
another picture of the back of her jacket.. . 
To use your own reasoning against your point: since the post was made in 2014,  it's very much plausible that such a small detail, like her orientation might've changed in development.. . Not that I care either way. This post just seems like it's reaching.
there's no evidence pointing to that. in fact, it's more like there's more evidence pointing to the opposite. if it's changed, then i think that she's attracted to guys *too*, but the women aspect hasn't changed. you do bring a fair point to the table, though.
Oh if there's sufficient evidence, why are you making an argument without presenting the evidence? . . It's fine if Aubrey is gay or bi in your head cannon. It's just not something that has been explored in the official lore.
it's very much there. the whole post is the stuff im presenting as evidence.
The top left image is irrelevant as many have pointed out, this is art that was too early in development to have any cannon meaning.  We don't even know who the two characters are. (don't debate please, I've seen your argument and still disagree). . The rest of the pics and the fact that they were roomies show that they were close friends. Absolutely nothing romantic is implied. . . Again, have fun with your head cannon, but don't try to convince others that it's cannon.
>The top left image is irrelevant as many have pointed out, this is art that was too early in development to have any cannon meaning.. . the omori trailer predates it.. . >The rest of the pics and the fact that they were roomies show that they were close friends. Absolutely nothing romantic is implied. . . first of all holy shit, it's an "and they were roommates" moment lol. second, since omocat already did stuff like pretty boy, it's not unlikely at all that she would make another queer character, and with all the princess carrying and what-not, it just may be aubrey, and that idea looks pretty convincing.
Vast majority of the time, when same sex people are roommates, it's completely platonic so it's silly to say that because they were roomies it implies anything romantic.. .  I've heard your argument and I'm just not convinced. Don't take this as me saying it's impossible for Aubrey to be bi/gay, I just truly don't think there's sufficient evidence to say one way or another.
they're not actually roommates, it's just a meme. have you actually played the whole game?
Its been a year since I've played and I'm not familiar with that meme. . . So they weren't even roommates. So there really is zero evidence or even subtle hints that Kim and Aubrey had romantic interest in each other.. . Why is it so important to you to try to push this specific narrative?
OH MY GOD. it's a vine from like 2014 IT'S NOT FROM THE GAME. christ.
Yup. I understand that. . . I was just trying to poke a little fun at you but you seem very irritable. I never meant to frustrate you this much. I truly hope your day is going okay.
Yeah, that's possible. But when its hinted she dated another girl then those two add up to a decent amount of evidence.
Oh, when was that hinted? I completely missed it in my playthrough
no I'm pretty sure that this is just another OC. I don't know about you but the ribbon here is pink and Aubrey was shown in art with a blue ribbon before this released
it's just an aesthetic choice. the piece in rendered with blue, pink and yellow, though it doesn't mean it reflects the actual colors of the clothes and hair. i think you're just trying to brush this off in favor of another ship you prefer, instead of looking at it objectively...
Its not confirmed but it looks a bit too much like Aubrey to say its not
porque no los dos?
good question actually
The first pic is not Aubrey though. Look at the date
well, the first omori trailer was released in april 2014, so that art piece actually came out after it. ps: (never noticed it, but the marker piece was posted on my birthday! cool coincidence)
Still 6 years before the release of the game. That character could have been scrapped, and her design later inspiring Aubrey's.. . It's like the Persona 5 fans thinking Hifumi was gonna be a PT.
I swear anyone in omori is shown to be a close friend of someone it's instantly interpreted as dating. Like it's never platonic
i personally don't frame a photo of me and my bestie in my room and princess carry her, but whatever floats your boat!
So like not to encourage any particular ship but princess carrying is pretty common. At least among stupid teenage boys, we did that shit all the time. I cannot recall why, maybe it was funny or a show of strength. Both of these things can be pretty platonic or romantic.
what world are you from where getting carried by your friend is considered romantic. like i think there are romantic undertones, but cmon man.
The princess carry one was a fan art right?. And yes,it is normal to have a picture of you and your bff framed
> The princess carry one was a fan art right? . . nope, official 2014 artwork posted by the official omori game account.. . [
Cool
Cool 
That isn't Aubrey in the top picture. that's one of omocats other OCs.
is it? doesn't look like any of them. are you saying that because you think it's not aubrey, or because it's definitely one of them? just to make it clear.
I've heard it from multiple people, idk. That picture kinda blew up on TikTok a while back. Everyone seemed to be in agreement that it isn't Aubrey, due to the hair color change, ribbon color change, completely different clothes, and completely unknown character "Aubrey" is kissing. People think omocats just drew a character using the cute ribbon they gave Aubrey, cause honestly that's the only thing that is making her seem like Aubrey. I should've clarified that, my bad. If omocat clarified it, cool.
well, she's wearing a bomber jacket, has the same haircut, and same ribbon. the color change is just an artistic choice, see: the limited color palette.  it just seems like misinformation. not trying to be snarky, just, check you sources next time.
What sources?. Where is any of this confirmed? Btw the jacket is clearly not the same. As you can see, it has short sleeves unlike Aubrey's jacket where the sleeves are just folded. Also the back of the jacket is exactly the same as in a Japanese school uniform what the left girl is wearing. So in conclusion, they're both wearing Japanese school uniforms and the only thing connecting Aubrey and the right girl is the ribbon, which is just a stupid reason to connect those two. Even the hairstyle isn't matching up since Aubrey's hair is completely straight and the girl in the picture has wavy hair. And the left girl isn't even familiar with us which indicates that this is just a normal art piece Omocat decided to share with us. And don't try to keep proving your point please, it has been proven false quite a while ago already. And these facts I stated here just prove it false even more
it hasn't been proven false. maybe try not freaking out and putting together a coherent argument.
I am quite calm actually. And yes it has been clearly proven false by multiple people here. I don't think there was even an argument to begin with since there is no proof for the ship being canon in the first place. You can say anything you want now but I already proved all of your "theories" false in my last comment
you didn't prove anything. your speculation is as valid as mine.
Speculation? I was speaking pure facts, you were just saying that's Aubrey because "The hair and clothes are exactly the same" which isn't true. But at least you're calling it a speculation this time
You ilusion
i think i'm pretty real.
Plis You terapia
And homophobic
: aubrey are you homophobic?. . : ..... basil, i AM gay. . : she's dodging the question sunny
ohh so when aubrey does it she's 'gay' but when basil and sunny do it they're just 'best friends'
they're all gay. happy ending 
that's what i like to see
The first artwork of the two girls kissing isn't supposed to be Aubrey iirc, even if the chara design is pretty similar
If the girl on the first drawing is confirmed to be Aubrey then ok, 'til then we can't affirm that anything's canon
I mean, it would be weird for Omocat to draw a girl in Aubrey’s outfit with Aubrey’s hair ribbon and not have it be Aubrey.
I thought the drawing was older than 2014 so yeah you're right
Nah the jacket is way different, in fact it's a Japanese school uniform
My point still stands on the bow.
Only the bow? Bro
It’s the exact same type of bow, which is one of Aubrey’s main defining physical characteristics.
Bro almost all bows look the same. And since the whole rest of the outfit is different + the hair is wavy unlike with Aubrey, I think it's very unlikely the girl in the picture is Aubrey. And the other girl in the pic is nobody we know either so that strongly hints that both of them are other oc's Omocat has made
No, there are a lot of different bow types. I’m pretty sure it’s meant to be Aubrey but, like, it’s no sweat off my back if it’s not.
I guess Aubrey is a Bi queen
Daily reminder that you are wrong
ok
Aubrey and Kim are only friends, she and her are close friends although made by fans, Aubrey moves with Sunny to support him, Kim and Basil becomes close.
aubrey in the image where she's holding kim looks cold af 🥶
fuckin true
It ain’t gay to kiss the homies
I’m all for gay Aubrey but could someone link that sketch bc I’m too lazy to go look for it myself
 there you go
thanks very helpful
The one on the top left just looks like a girl with a ribbon and is likely was made before aubrey was even a thought omocat had, and most of this art doesn't really say anything. Platonic relationships do exist ya know? Idk why best friends always equals to gayness.
the first omori trailer predates the top left one by months. yes, there IS a possibility they're gal pals and aubrey just happens to kiss girls as well, but it's just unlikely.
you like kissing girls don't you

i knew it ur a girlkisser
My hc is that she's bi with a female lean
"that just aint right" 🐕
That’s not canon though.
Its not. But none of the ships are canon so its as canon as the others.
No shit
She is literally me!
Still doesn’t disprove the swingset scene.
where aubrey's concerned about the health of a friend who hasn't gone outside for 4 years?
I definitely headcanon as her being a girl kisser. Her and Kim are super cute and my favorite Auby ship. And yes the art of her kissing another girl isn't confirmed her, its like cmon if we can make insane assumptions for ships like sunburn (I'm looking at you people who say Aubrey looking at Sunny in the hangout moment and people saying Aubrey's bed being the same in headspace as real life is sunburn evidence), then we can sure as hell say its probably Aubrey
First, *you're . . Second which part is crazy
But why they trash
Yeah, you will not stay my ship from the path of God.
What path, all the gods dead smh
Because they are gay ships? Lmao
I know who I am
"I know what you are."
Do you know who you are?. . When you words.... . DONT, SOUND, LIKE *YOUR OWN*?
omg she's just like me :0
Y'know, I always sort of thought that Kim x Aubrey was a cute ship :). . (Also side note: I really love that marker piece by Omocat it's so visually pleasing <3)
I'm the only who spot that "Wanna go ad-free?"
Why am I just finding out Kim is a girl...
bi aubrey. . bi aubrey. . bi aubrey. . bottom text
I KISS A GIRL AND SOCIETY.. SOCIETY CALLS ME GAY
This is just my two cents, and you are 100% allowed to have your own headcanon and I respect that . . Apart from the top left one, none of these necessarily screams “relationship” to me. I mean I have pics of my friends in my bedroom, doesn’t mean I’m dating them lol. And to me the bottom left one just kinda seems like them hanging out. Top right one does raise an eyebrow I guess, but idk, once again doesn’t necessarily scream relationship to me.. . Returning to that top left one, well one it’s a really neat drawing, but I have no idea who the girls in it are, and 2014 was super early in development anyway. Unless the art is official OMORI art I don’t think it demonstrates anything other than that omocats incredible art skills.. . I’ve always been kinda curious about this ship because actually in game we don’t actually see Aubrey and Kim like have actually interactions that much. Like obviously the game makes it very clear that they are best friends, and that Kim is trying to fill the void left after the incident, but in terms of actual dialogue and interactions, there ain’t that much to base what the dynamic of these two even would be. Idk, I guess it’s just one of those things I don’t get.. . Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, enjoy your headcanon, friend
WHY DID YOU CLICK ON THIS POST?    . DID YOU WANT TO SEE GIRLS KISSING?    . YOU LIKE GIRLS.    . YOU LIKE KISSING.    . YOU LIKE GIRLS KISSING!
Yes! I was headcanning her as bi :)
&#x200B;. . 
WOW IT'S CANON??
yeah :3c
This sub when straight ship: :D Yes so canon, real. . This sub when gay ship: Noo omg can’t you just let people be friends?! There’s no evidence, let’s start a debate!! L, unbased, ratio! I don’t get shipping anyway let’s stop guys. . . Like bro y’all aren’t and never have been subtle even if you’ll never admit it
And this ladyes and gentelmen is the reazone why I find this sub so bloody annoying! Seriously can't stand this shit.
BAHAHAHAH yeah true

I never kissed, but Yes?. . 
“Say that you lesbian, girl, me too.”. Aubrey Drake Graham
omori fans finding out about friendships 
omori fans finding out about gay people 
Who is the girl at top left? Doesn't look like Kim
i... have no idea, actually. but aubrey's kissing A girl and that's all that matters to me lol
True
Could be both a boy kisser and a girl kisser but mostly a girl kisser
i never said that she wasn't a boy kisser as well 
Brain explosion 💥
I'm pretty sure that's hs aubrey kissing rw aubrey *
As a lesbian, I am happy about this
Cries and sobs bc she’s perfect
enthusiactically upvoting this truth
Bisexual aubrey?!?! (YAY)
Wait... it could it be... COTTON CANDY?!
Girl kisser is definitely one of the ways you could describe someone who likes girls 
im a girl kisser too 
She is a HOMO
she put the "omo" in homo (get it? cuz omori?)
What does girl kisser mean?. . Is it just lesbian?
someone who kisses girls 
Why didn't i think of that
Well the first one is an unidentified girl that never appears in the final story(2014) so it's not canon, for the others I think it's just Omocat trying to make that "best friends" type of relationship, there is no clue for  them being togheter, even the fact that Aubrey might be lesbian or bisexual... isn't it a bit weird to assume that she would go around and kiss every girl that gets close to her? It's like if she was shown kissing a boy  it would mean she would also kiss Sunny, I am pretty sure people would've instead assume it ruins the ship
Why do gay people insist on making children that have not been shown to be gay, gay? It’s gross
boooo i had 3 roblox girlfriends when i was eight are you SCARED
Omori Reddit users try to have a good comeback challenge impossible
why is it not a problem when people ship sunburn? or any other aubrey ship with one of the male characters? she hasn't been shown to be straight, either. you're homophobic.
W aubrey
Soooo Aubrey is Pan confirmed. . I have unlocked a new form. It's called Super Shipper it's a form beyond a super saiyen. . I dunno what it does but it looks like super saiyen blue and ultra instinct at the same time. . Now imma go fight Zeno brb
Straight girls kiss other girls as well tho
.. not really?
What do you base that on?
personal experience, as i've been friends with some straight girls. almost all the straight girls i've seen kiss other girls have turned out bisexual, or any other sexuality attracted to multiple genders.
In my experience girls kiss other girls to expirement because they’re at an experimental age. That doesn’t mean that they’re gay as long as they don’t have a gay intention behind it.
You don't kiss another girl to "experiment".. . Touching fire is for babies, teens are beyond that, they know the things they don't like, so if a girl willingly kisses another girl to "experiment" it only means that she wants to try that, she wouldn't try something she doesn't like, say, spinach, unless she was forced/encouraged to.
Babies touching fire is a bad thing to compare that too, babies touch fire cause they  dont know the consequences, ( some ) teens do things cause they think fuck it lets try it
Time to go get that copy pasta brb
hc
yeah
omori fans when they find out minors can date people
the girl isnt even a character in the game, so i guess not

Aubrey X Kim Is Canon
bruh????
Ok this comment section is frying my pea sized brain, so to put it simply: No one should care about the sexual identity of a fictional character, especially if unconfirmed. Honestly, just don’t overthink it
I don't know why but this hit me right in the heart 
Say Gex!
That doesn't mean she can't be a boykisser too. . Bi aubrey, aubi
Wait, the blue jacket person is a girl? I always thought that was a guy lol
i haven't met any guys named kimberly lol
Well i havent met any girls named Kimberly either lmao. No but seriously I'm not saying you're wrong, im just suprised
She's the most bisexual character I've ever seen lmao
It isn't gay if you say "sorry i was using you for my evil nefarious plans". 
. . TF2 fans after spending hours on Gay furry p—-
Prepare for a flood of dark-haired Aubrey fanarts in the very near future
Omori fans when they learn that Aubrey's hair is dyed and wasn't always pink
wtf are you talking about, obviously her natural hair color is pink
Don't forget her eyes
Now I’m wondering how different the game would be if we got dark-haired Aubrey instead of dyed-haired Aubrey…
Slightly worse, because the only difference is that we wouldn’t get that >!sad little detail about how Aubrey still couldn’t let go of Mari!<
The art looks nice, but did she dye her eyes as well?
She just stopped wearing contact lens
Aubrey dyed her hair and put on contacts, originally her hair and eyes were both dark.
I always wondered what she’d look like with her natural hair and without lenses
Sunny: Aubrey, before we go on the date, would you put this wig on?  . Aubrey: ...Why?  . Sunny: And wear Mari's old school uniform?
and their date is a picnic
Nah, he'd ask her to put on Headspace Aubrey's clothes and to call him Omori.
Does it count as roleplay if the person you're playing is basically yourself?
I mean, people are making self-insert characters for game/cartoon/movie universes (*cough* MaouChara *cough* *cough*), so yeah, I think it does
Noooooooo
: do it.  . : noooo
Dark haired Aubrey has a bit of a resemblance to Mari ngl
Same-face syndrome.
Every one get into the post auby day bunker
she looks a lot like her younger self without the dyed hair and contacts ngl
HOLY SHIT
[Link to tweet]()
Damn,  . she is still perfect.
KEL!. . (aubrey is happy because he invited her to his birthday)
I prefer dark hair aubrey, she somehow looks more badass
Happy birthday, Aubrey.

Now i understand why i prefer discord dark mode
My brother's! :D
Aubrey lookin' as good as always
Now i like aubrey as a character even more
She looks Chinese
So what you’re saying is she’s 18?. . (I apologize for my sins)

shit bro I gotta color the one with white hair
whose*. . >!I'm sorry, okay!<
Huh neat
magic auby
aubrey is not a nazi you cringe ass boi
It’s a joke
ok
She looks like little Aubrey
i love aubrey's birthday art. theres a lot to analyze. why is she jumping a fence?
shes tryna get to every1 else
Well obviously but why in that way
Based on what we know about Aubrey's mom, she's probably sneaking out
her mom? i was thinking her dad
Could be, tbh I don't know much about Aubrey
We dunno too much about her parents in general, besides her dad being gone and her mom being presently basically an invalid, seemingly due to drinking. The people in the background in the church fight comment that the loss of her father is why she's so "uncontrollable" now, so that has led to the perception that her father was the more commanding type, and that she might have had to work around him to hang out with everyone at times, if only for certain days.
Or she could be uncontrollable because she’s behaving badly as a way to cope with her grief and anger over her father leaving - that is the most obvious explanation, not that her father controlled her more
sneaking out when you don’t actually have to is a very kid thing to do
Considering her parents and the lore i think it's something she had to do
Breaking and entering
she's escaping
a same place. . &#x200B;. . maybe AUBREY's house?
I would let Aubrey bully me
We’re on Reddit, did you expect anything else?
Reddit when 16 year olds
I mean, I'm 14 so it's not THAT bad
....Da.
GET BEHIND ME DOKTOR
YA
CHARGE ME
YES! **Use übercharge*


Same here

God I see you everywhere
tehee 
Can you bully me ?
Why would i do that 
I was joking ! (Why is your pfp the rope meme ?)
ummm 
You need a hug don’t you ? *hug you*
How did you know  *hugs back*
*big hug*🫂 it’s my superpower. If you ever feel like life couldn’t get any worse, remember that it is made of ups and downs, and if you’re in the downs, ups will come eventually ! If you need someone to talk to, I’m here ! (And maybe you already have someone to rely on and in that case I’m sorry.)
Thank you

:3
I was talking about Susie and Auby but yea 
Aubrey's expression reminds me of Katie Killjoy in the Hazbin Hotel pilot
Now I get that I might get stoned from this, but AUBREY and Susie from Deltarune aren't really that similar. Sure they do have a certain level of similarity, like how both >!are suggested to come from troubled backgrounds, and both have rough personalities!<, but there are still some differences:. . * >!AUBREY feels like her friends weren't there for her when MARI died, but Susie likely has self-esteem issues and thinks that no-one is worthy of her friendship, and she takes that out on Kris!<. * >!AUBREY, despite being passive, still isn't open yet to the friend group, judging by the fact that she still frowns and doesn't seem to interact positively with them (judging by the fact that she slaps KEL, grabs HERO by the ear and nervously shows her elbow to SUNNY in their respective tag polaroids), and after chapter 1, Susie just mysteriously chooses to behave nicely with Kris, ignoring the fact that she's been bullying them and pushing them around ever since she came to hometown!<. * >!AUBREY is generally serious when she talks in the game, Susie has a largely ironic attitude and almost always speaks in jest. !<
Doesn't Aubrey punch Kel in one of the pictures from Faraway Town?
None of the characters are all that similar- V, the last girl at the top, is literally a murder robot designed by a company to kill other robots (she does still have personality and stuff of course). I was referring to the archetype of "lesbian stereotype bullies gay stereotype" as a joke and not much else.. This however was helpful as I have learned a bit more about Susie lol
Don't worry, I was more specifically referring to people who say that Susie and AUBREY are really similar (they're not)
Waaaaaaaiiiittttt I just realised you made the aubrey drip omgosh you’re so good
Ahh ya that was me :) I love them so much
oh i bet you'll love aubrey
I'm so in love with this.. . Thank you for creating it.
And thank you for liking it! :D

Thank you!!

I love your art style! There's not enough Aubrey's on this subreddit, definitely giving ya a follow!
Awww, this is cute
Holy hell that's a growth spurt if i've ever seen one

aww this is really nice
So nice.

This is the cutest thing ever i wanna cry

I like ur art style have a good day!
Thank you so much!

Aubreys are so cute!
ok ngl for a second i thought she was gutpunching aubrey and not holding her questionable plushie
the artstyle reminds me of danganronpa
nicee my artstyle is partially inspired by danganronpa actually
They're both so cute
This fandom is too wholesome just like you and this soo good drawn fanart
Thank you, happy to know that!
mark as spoiler... maybe
I absolutely adore your design of Aubrey
Question, why did you decide to use different line weights for either Aubrey's, as well as different line colours?
Ohh teen Aubrey is in my normal artstyle, and for the headspace one is my attempt at imitating Omori artstyle
cute
This is so CUTE AUGH
this looks amazing, nice job!
Your style reminds me of The World Ends With You and Persona. Love it!
I'm so glad that you think so because my artstyle really is inspired by those games including a bit of danganronpa!
This is amazing

adorable
They’re both adorable and I love them
"Excuse me, she asked for no pickles."
ITS TO CUUUUUUTE
What annoys me more is Aubrey somehow taking the truth well. You know, someone who's is extremely implusive and emotionally volatile. Because you know, the end of the last day was definitely a dramatic change of heart, rather than a troubled teenager finally recognizing her mistakes and starting to own up to them.. . Don't get me wrong, I think she'll eventually forgive them. That's going to take time though, and she probably has to reconcile with her own actions properly before she's going to forgive anyone really.
Honestly, I could see Aubrey taking the truth well *because* she’s volatile and impulsive. She understands what it’s like to lash out and feel conflicted and regretful about it. She even has a parallel situation happen when she >!pushes Basil into the lake.!< I feel like on an instinctive level, she would get it. . . That’s just my thoughts though.
Logically, she won't.. . The contexts of the situations are simply too different.
I just thought that Aubrey was the least emotionally stable out of them, your arguments does make sense though.
Don't get me wrong, she would react very emotionally to that information because that's how she is, same for the other two. But we all know that they will forgive them sooner or later, as the credits scene suggests (The stump with the flowers and the pinwheel) 
*"Rather than a troubled teenager finally recognizing her mistakes and starting to own up to them."*. . Isn't it straight up said that she was aware of what she fucked up with? The treehouse scene makes it obvious. "Change of heart" fits somewhat, as she did kind of realize that said mistakes were wrong during the period of a single day, but it doesn't seem too emotionally impulsive to do.. . The "impulsive and emotionally volatile" fits though, although the first part of it logically triggers from emotions in-general. Doing something while not thinking is kind of normal when somebody is having an emotional outburst.. . &#x200B;. . ^(No, i won't be here to participate in an argument about anything, the account's state in a few hours should answer why.Or not... well, it at-least should have.)
I think the art is depicting the group trying to sneak Aubrey out of the house.
I figured he was like, acting as a lookout, since they seem to be sneaking Aubrey out, so he's trying to keep an eye out for if anyone notices.
no way dude thats 100% backflip stance right there. . someone could come up and shoot all of his friends in the face and he'd have no idea anything happened bcuz he's trying to do a backflip
I saw a fanart of Aubrey grabbing her younger self by the hair that was really cool. I can't find it though.
That pre-release aubrey art where she's doing a jump attack
Aubrey is adorable
aubrey becomes the new cryo meta

Its good, but dont do Aubrey that dirty
there is a french deputy called "aubry" who looks like aubrey or auby, it's fun

Okay the aubrey one is really cute
Agree. An adult man would have more lifting power than a teen girl even if he just jogs (unless she’s like a powerlifting maniac or has been in martial arts for a few years), but Aubrey is a fighter.
aubrey probably don't even fight that much since faraway is pretty small, maybe she's hit basil a few times on the head with a bat
A STREET FIGHTER! ... But that's just a theory...
What strength!! But don't forget there are many guys like you all over the world!
You were supposed to say "A GAME THEORY!" like Matpat, anyway good response though
Aubrey’s like that one white girl at school with the Cookie Monster pajama pants that lives with her grandma. It doesn’t matter who you are she *will* beat your ass.
speaking from personal experience?
oddly specific yet oddly relatable
sounds like you might have had a white girl with cookie monster pajama pants who lives with her grandma at ur school
Every American high school has one it’s just part of our culture
one more weird thing to note about americans 🖊
Plus he exercises every day, meanwhile Aubrey is just naturally tough.
Beating trespassing dweebs out of the secret lake counts as exercise 
Also he’s an adult
: I have a bat and you don't. . : Aubrey put that away
>!“The sun shined brighter when she was here” !<. . Edit: why do I have a floating aubrey how do I fix it
I mean Calm Down, not persist. Calm down is enough to facetank playground Aubrey (she does around 30-40 per hit + turn idles vs calm down 40 heal per use)
What about the ainmations? RW Aubrey's attack Is the exact same as DW Aubrey's
Aubrey solo's
I feel like Kel is stronger than Aubrey, considering he loves playing basketball, and you need a lot of strength for that. He's just more of a peaceful airhead compared to Aubrey. Aubrey carries around her bat just to appear more intimidating
Idk man. He needed a lot of bandaids in those two Aubrey fights
aubrey's totally number one with kel leading behind, hero's not very athletic and was always dead last in headspace whenever they were going, along with some dialogues with him telling the others to wait up for him.. i'd say he would be put right where you put aubrey
I think it was mentioned that Aubrey's dad was with her on the day of the recital.
Wasn't Aubrey cut off from everybody?
update 10:. . going to get aubrey at the church so we can get the picture book back
Update 11:. Gonna wait for polly to Finnish cooking food
Update 14:. Fighting king crawler
Yes! I find them so sweet  Kim and her relationship with Aubrey underrated fr
This could be true but we dont have much info on kim her entire purpose is aubrey new best friend
Kim's a girl, I think.
Yeah she is. I vote on spelling error on fahad-123321's part though. At least I hope so.
Yeah sorry fixed it
considering kim shows up in headspace \[as berly\] we can get a little more insight into their relationship \[also kim is a gal\]
I don't know if Berly really adds much besides the fact that Kim is probably short for Kimberly
Well, it implies that Kim taught Aubrey how to headbutt people, given the headspace quest as well as the fact that both Kim and Aubrey can headbutt in some fights. That's important, probably.
Doesn’t matter if it’s canon or not lol
Argument for self defense, Aubrey came at him with a *nail bat*. She could have easily done worse than a concussion to him with that thing.
Fair fair
I mean you can still do the route after going outside on the first day, maybe even the second day but idk for that one, I just know not the third. So yeah either way in any route you can stab Aubrey 
As a multishipper, this is just one of the many ships I appreciate. It might not be my fave containing Aubrey but I like it nonetheless
Kim is a bad influence on Aubrey
Kim stole candy but Aubrey was literally willing to carry around a lethal weapon in a church
Finally! Logic and goddamn reason!
lol
Honestly Aubrey is more of a bad influence on Kim
Didn't Kim introduce Aubrey to the hooligans?
How the group formed is not confirmed
It's presumed that the group formed before Aubrey became a member and imo Kim would be the bad influence, since we know that she commits crimes and likes to fight.
Ok but are the crimes really that bad if it's against Candice? she a b####
Crimes are still crimes. Kim and Vance didn't do it because they didn't like Candice, they did it because they're addicted to sweets.
Kim clearly cares for Aubrey, so I guess it makes sense
It feel like you're shipping me with Aubrey /j
Bad ship because at the lake when Aubrey was having her breakdown, Kim left :(. . Didn't try hard enough imo to try and be there even though Aubrey was visibly upset
well, kim was the one who got snuuy and kil when aubrey refused to leave her house, so clearly she cares about her enough to do that. whether thats because theyre together or just good friends is up to you, but they certainly care about eachother
I would like to point out that in the beta, you were able to change your gender, this also caused Aubrey’s gender to be the opposite of your gender.
Okay👍
I think it's because cotton candy is commonly pink, like AUBREY's hair.
Avg les fan vs avg AUBREY X OMORI ENJOYER
Honestly, a ship I could believe (that no one talks about) is Aubrey x Vance. Since Aubrey and Kim are close she'd be close to Vance by association. Vance basically follows Kim. Vance's dialogue after the fight also implies he likes being dominated by women. Think of the pure terrorism Aubrey could cause with Cancer at her side?! They'd be unstoppable!
Let's get out Dream World Aubrey. Why? Because I'm a menace and quickly going after the main cast

I really wish that Faraway Aubrey will win. She really feels like the deepest, most realistic character in the game.
easily dw aubrey
I don’t really care for Aubrey. Not a bad character but still far from a favorite.
I am voting out Aubrey, she is my least favorite for very understandable reasons, such as her name is my deadname.
auby! 🫳 (headpat)
I love my girl Aubrey but remember she literally lives in a house full of garbage and is outside all day she probably doesn’t smell that good
Rw Aubrey is strawberry shortcake but with a hint of rust
you could say the same about aubrey. they kind of all look similar.
In fact, I can't find out the difference between HS Mari 'n HS Aubrey
ikr, i spent a good chunk of hs getting them mixed up before i realized aubrey was the one with the bow
dragon ball case fr
>!Could be wrong, but I believe she wanted to dye her hair purple alongside Aubrey's pink hair.!<
She did dye her hair purple, I don't think it's on any of the flashbacks but on the Merch website it is (the picture with them all wearing merch)
I actually knew that already.
Okay? This post said things that are easy to miss, not things that you specifically don't know.
I just wanted to mention it, that's all.
She had an awful knee, but everyone knows that one. . How about Aubrey wearing her bow
aubrey is gay would make kimxaubrey most likely canon tho. . &#x200B;. . it would be better if omocat just tweeted "All characters are aroace, except hero and mari, all of your ships arent canon"
i was mostly aiming to just decanonize any ship between two or more of the main quartet, as those are the most popular ones
i see
Ah but this falls directly into the lap of KimxAubrey shippers.
i was just canceling out any ships between the main quartet, aka the most popular ships.
It'd be in-character if she set Aubrey as the account profile picture while doing it though
Bold of you to assume that out of all the characters Aubrey would say a slur. I'd guess Sweetheart.
Kim x Aubrey IS canon wdym 😒/j
He works, though I prefer Sunburn (Aubrey’s cool like that). . And I’m just referring to the ingame hints. Aubrey’s pretty on the nose with the swing scene and Dream Aubrey simping for Omori. Basil’s hints are more subtle… fitting for his personality really. 
Anything Aubrey is instantly great 💪 I'm actually writing a long meta about Sunny's sexuality and the larger framework of puberty, but it's painfully unfinished right now 
I headcanon that Omori is aroace and hates the advances from Dream Aubrey and Basil, but puts up with it because Sunny likes it, so he's just suffering during his bisexual other self's romantic fantasies lol
aubrey
>!Aubrey cuddles Sunny a bit too hard while sleeping, breaking his ribs and suffocating him. And now we have Omori 2.!<

Edit: Tip though: plushies tend to sell out really quickly, especially when they release for the first time. If you want the Aubrey plushie, try to go on the website a couple minutes before the release time (usually 5:00 PM in Pacific Time) stay on there until it releases, then instantly buy it as fast as you can! Just keep in mind that the website is locked around ten minutes before a new release, so you can’t browse the website then.
Ah okay thanks for the tip!
Suppose i was expecting a mildly angrier expression, but that aside, seeing these be announced after years sure is something. Doesn't even feel 100% real.
AUBY!! I NEED!
It would be cool if she had the  face

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
Yoshikage Kira is not married. Aubrey also isn't married. Related
Aubrey has hands thus her and kira are connected.
Aubrey has the same type of stand as Killer Queen. . . yes i know its not funny

Aubrey is the only character in the party that can deal a one-hit knockout - in the dream world, she can use last resort to cause a party member to be knocked out in a single hit (albeit that member being herself). . In the real world, she has Home Run, which could deal a one-hit knockout under specific circumstances (like an imposter)

My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

There’s something to be said about the other word too 

Connection terminated. I'm sorry to interupt you Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, but I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You're not here to recieve a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labirynth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. This is where your story ends.   .    . And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should. And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still, and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting old friend.   .    . My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should have known you wouldn't be contempt to just disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now.   .    . It's time to rest. For you, and those you have carried in your arms. This ends, for all of us. End communication.   .    . beep

A Good Person
Aubrey is a good person on the inside. Very related.
What do you mean aubrey is a good person on the inside? Are you trying to imply that aubrey is a bad person on the outside?
Yes 🙌

Didn't she like, attack her ex-friends like two or three times
I know Kel provoked her a lot, but he had a reason (for example her constantly bullying Basil) and when confronted, she was just like "You wouldn't get it" and started beating the shit out of you. She didn't even try to talk it out, she just straight up attacked you. Aubrey isn't a bad person on the inside, but you can't pretend she was trying to look like an angel.
D4C LT and it’s concept of Misfortune being redirected at others.
Bit of a stretch but. . D4C LT >!is a part of Valentine, just like how Headspace Aubrey is a part of Sunny's imagination. Headspace Aubrey also has the Counter skill, which redirects misfortune (enemies target her) away from Sunny/Omori, just like how D4C LT redirects misfortune away from Valentine. Headspace Aubrey is how Sunny imagines real life Aubrey, which connects irl Aubrey to Valentine, making D4C LT relevant to Aubrey!<

Every comment ive seen is related to aubrey in some way and thats impressive
It all began with a white flash. On that day, the Earth was apocalyptic-ly changed. Plants died, the earth split open, strange new weather patterns appeared, and the sun in the sky stopped moving. But most terrible of all, was that every female being in Olathe either disappeared or died, leaving only the men to slowly die as a species. With no way to continue reproducing, the communities and societies of people that once thrived quickly degraded into swaths of violence and degeneration. However, this could soon change, as a broken shell-of-a-man named Brad Armstrong discovers a baby a few yards from his home; a baby girl to be precise. Faced with a choice to either give up the baby to people who are more qualified to take care of it or to raise her himself, Brad chooses to protect her himself as a way to make up for an awful, abusive childhood past. Years later though, he one day returns home to find a broken home, a dead friend, and the girl- named Buddy- missing. It's now up to Brad to journey the wastes of Olathe to find his lost daughter, and nothing will stand in his way. Not murderers, not perverts, not armies, not mutants, not even old friends will stop his chase.

I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a "hit" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. \[Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in "Blood Money."\] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.

The M1 Abrams is a third generation American main battle tank designed by Chrysler Defense (now General Dynamics Land Systems) and named for General Creighton Abram's. Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons (almost 62 metric tons), it introduced several innovative features, including a multifuel turbine engine, sophisticated Chobham composite armor, a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and NBC protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, while later variants feature a licensed Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44.

Connection terminated.. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth, if you still even remember that name, But I'm afraid you've been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume, although, you have indeed been called. You have all been called here, into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection and misfortune. A labyrinth with no exit, a maze with no prize. You don't even realize that you are trapped. Your lust for blood has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber, always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach, but you will never find them. None of you will. This is where your story ends.. . And to you, my brave volunteer, who somehow found this job listing not intended for you, although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that's not what you want. I have a feeling that you are right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away. As the agony of every tragedy should.. . And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don't belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace and perhaps more waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although, for one of you, the darkest pit of Hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don't keep the devil waiting, old friend.. . My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return as well. It's in your nature to protect the innocent. I'm sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die, no one was there to lift you up into their arms the way you lifted others into yours, and then, what became of you. I should have known you wouldn't be content to disappear, not my daughter. I couldn't save you then, so let me save you now. It's time to rest - for you, and for those you have carried in your arms.. . This ends for all of us.. . End communication.

Number 15:. Burger King Foot Lettuce.. The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get. A 4channer uploaded a photo anonymously to the site showcasing his feet in a plastic bin of lettuce, with the statement: "This is the lettuce you eat at Burger King." Admittedly, he had shoes on.. . But that's even worse.. . The post went live at 11:38 PM on July 16th, and a mere 20 minutes later, the Burger King in question was alerted to the rogue employee. At least, I hope he's rogue. How did it happen? Well, the BK employee hadn't removed the Exif data from the uploaded photo, which suggested the culprit was somewhere in Mayfield Heights, Ohio. This was at 11:47. Three minutes later at 11:50, the Burger King branch address was posted with wishes of happy unemployment. 5 minutes later, the news station was contacted by another 4channer. And three minutes later, at 11:58, a link was posted: BK's "Tell us about us" online forum. The foot photo, otherwise known as exhibit A, was attached. Cleveland Scene Magazine contacted the BK in question the next day. When questioned, the breakfast shift manager said "Oh, I know who that is. He's getting fired." Mystery solved, by 4chan. Now we can all go back to eating our fast food in peace.

Aubrey is cool and all but we got too many emojis of her that are hardly even used 



When was the last time you’ve seen  or  used in a normal comment
never
: FUCK YOU FUCK SHIT TITS BITCH FUCKING HECK PECK NECK PIECE OF CRAP N-. . : aubrey what the heck are you talking about
Unironically it's because of this that I always get turned off by fics that turn Aubrey or other characters into swear-spewers. Some even make them casually curse half the time, it's ridiculous. Almost like they never played the game.
Yeah, that's how I feel too. Although it is weird that angsty teenagers don't swear at all in-game, it feels so off when fanfic writers overdo the cursing (I've noticed that in pursuit)
Here's the order I'd think the others would forgive the two:. . Kel, Hero, Aubrey. . He'd definitely take a while, but his empathy would probably lead him to taking it better than Aubrey despite being closer with Mari. Plus, as some other comments said, the fact that he already went through a lot of grief, and in a similar way to Sunny in fact, would probably help him empathise with him better too.
Aubrey's got a bigger one 



So, this one goes with a headcanon I have for Aubrey (that being that she loves jazz music after witnessing [Diamond Jack]()). Hero also loves jazz, and has been learning how to play the drums in college. He also was the one who showed Aubrey Diamond Jack in the first place.
Looking at Sans Aubrey fills me with determination
I often headcanon Aubergine being Aubrey's full first name. She just goes by Aubrey because it's easier to say.. . Would also explain why she loves her eggplant plushy.
isnt this already canon?
this but i also like to give Aubrey the last name of Gine to complete the aubergine pun
I like "Williams" for Aubrey
actually dang I like that one too, I forget which fics had that one
Sunny and Mari: Campbell. . Basil: Systewitch. . Hero and kel: Wayne. . Aubrey: Maubrey

Aubrey Aubergine.
I dunno but i think aubrey might be italo-french, like aostan or smt so i think blanc
Sunny & Mari Suzuki. . Kel & Hero Rodriguez. . Aubrey Hester (Hester means star, and was the name of a legendary female warrior. Aubrey means something to the effect of “ruler”, so I think this fits). . Basil Forrest (no duh)
Not to mention that since Sunny had a crush on Aubrey, Headspace Aubrey is obsessed with him - so Kel's gotta have cooties!
sunny had a crush on aubrey…???
Yeah, it's made pretty clear by how headspace Aubrey acts around Omori. >!Man even had an entire harem of Aubreys fight over him at one point.!<

Oh that I see, yeah okay I guess they did both give a "lil" shove because they were mad
Damn I'll have to give it a good listen to.. . Also- since we're talking about noises in houses- I heard voices in Aubrey's house or something like that if you raise the volume and listen long enough. Could that be connected to anything?
It's possible it's from the TV that Aubrey's mom watches all day. But that's the only logical reason I can really think of.. . It's possible that those kind of voices just occurs in any house with traumatic and grief stricken people but I'd say it's a stretch. It's implied that Aubrey's parents also separated at some point in the 4 years.
are aubrey is gay?
i'm not even 16 and i'm biromantic. it's not sexual, you're making it sexual.
... i'm weird for wanting to know if a fictional character is like me?
plus im pretty sure that its a joke

I'm sorry, but... Auby must go.
Guys let's think this through. Aubrey has to get AT LEAST third place. She is one of the most influential characters in the game. With all respect for the Gigachad who Hero is, Auby belongs on the podium along with Kel and Sunny (not respectively? idrk how it turns out)

Pulled off devious licks in school.
I fucking hated the devious licks with every fiber of my being
I liked when people started making fun of it and you’d just see a stolen cargo ship listed as a “devious lick”
Those were stupid
She becomes a Christian youth counselor
The qualities and a leader and the know-how and connection with hurting youth. I feel this is perfect for Aubrey and quite likely.
she uses the cheapest hair bleach and dye she can find so now her hair is fried as shit and feels like straw
I'm definitely stealing this one.
When Sunny confesses the truth, Aubrey has a flashback of when she shoved Basil into the lake.. . Aubrey is the first to forgive Sunny.
She stole nuclear launch codes

Really? I’ve always imagined her to smell like some sort of perfume
She lives in a dump, each second of sleep surrounded by smells creeping in from below, permeating into her clothes and hair. Then she spends the majority of her day mucking about, doing hooligan things (which involve getting dirty) and may even have a hard time getting a shower, especially if bills aren't always paid on time. All in all, it would be surprising if Aubrey didn't stink at least a little. Not too much, she would do everything in her power to be clean, but her circumstances and lifestyle would never let her stay clean for long.
True, that’s was a pretty dumb head cannon of me 💀💀
She is not girly and hates being called a girl, my headcanon.
Those aren't opposites, she may put on way too much perfume in an attempt to cover up the various smells of her house
She kills peopel
Oh boy! Murder! That's my favorite felony!
It's my second favorite!
She learned how to box, and can break a small tree by punching it
Damn she's like Steve!
Oh god I hate that
She would totally love Nu-Metal.
She’s a racist, she just doesn’t know it yet
Her sexuality forms a circle
What
#HER SEXUALITY FORMS A CIRCLE
•
Her sexuality is so not-straight it makes a circle.
Oh
Self-cest?
Deadass just masturbation but no.. . Her sexuality is so not-straight it makes a circle.
Ha, I was thinking along the lines of imagining the ends touching to loop into extreme self-love lol, immediately thought of self-cest.
honestly im sorry but there’s no way ALL of the mains are straight. . there’s like 4 pixels in the game and my gaydar’s still going crazy
Maybe we just forgot what friends are and they actually are just good friends
They didn't even mention ships, th
didnt say it was because of relationships. it’s the *vibes*. . and yall dont say that “we forgot what friends are” to straight ships and the treatment really shows
>!After the truth,!< and as she grows older, she will become a fervent Christian.. . Ready to retake Jerusalem
The crusade knows no end my brother
And she will fail, get bankruptcy and die a meaningless death after a Tetanus infection.
She would definitely spoiler tag her posts
[and if other people don't...]()
Im saving this
Aubrey is the type of girl that’ll smoke weed to get out of drinking at a party
Aubrey listens to Mitski on a daily basis
So she's me?
She is kinda fruity
After the events of the good ending, I like to think she went back to the treehouse that night and spent the night just her and Mr. Plantegg. . . My head cannon is that she went back angry and prepared to destroy the treehouse since >!sunny moved away!<, but maybe seeing something like Mr. Plantegg or the other toys they used to play with made her break down in tears and gave her a new perspective on the past few years and her friends.. . I also like to think maybe that helped her to move on and start to move through her grief, and move past the anger she felt and onto a brighter future, accepting her past and present self to become whole.. . And of course Mr. Plantegg was no longer dusty, he got a ton of love and became one of Aubrey’s most treasured possessions :)
Aubrey is most def a Mitsuki fan, She talks with basil about it all the time
Aubrey plays Metal Gear Rising:Revengeance with Sunny and her Hooligans.. . Her favorite character is Senator Armstrong.
She eventually becomes a lot more like her old self after the events of the good ending.
incredibly damaged hair from repetitive bleaching && coloring
On an unrelated note…. . Golly, she got some wide-ass ears, now that I’m looking at it lol
Aubrey likes Orange Joe
>!She was abused by her mother when she was younger!<
OK why this Basil dressed up as Aubrey?
she may quite possibly enjoy death grips
She sleeps with a weapon in hand just in case of a robber but would probably sleep through the robbery
Correction, she IS the robber
She says "fuck cops" and oinks whenever she sees one
So a Revacholian?
She's a toxic league of legends or valorant player. She's yelling into voice chat how everyone's So dog
she is wanted to for multiple acts of vandalism, arson, and disturbance of the peace
*Homosexual*
She listens to "Can you feel my heart" un-memely
she has probouns
Never flushes. Not even once

Then I'm afraid she must die for her sins
Not if she kills you first
Oh, I just LOVE IT when they fight back!
I know of someone named Aubrey irl lol
Shes homophobic and plays cod
She has killed people with her bar before, but no one’s gonna snitch on her since she’s such a bad B
auby
Auby
She’s dating Kim
lesbian
Gay
Agreed.
really talented at gymnastics, competes in competitions
She have spare bats everywhere.
When she becomes a adult, she turns her hair blond
she’s a lesbian
No this is cursed, why is this RW Basil with RW Aubrey’s hair??
Not that story again, this isn't the reddit for this type of discussion.
This isn't some funny joke, it's a controversy (based on nothing concerning really) that should have been left in the past, now please stop it!
She’s a junkie loves drugs and emo quotes depressed teen and make cringe edit and tiktok with stupid dance fall in love with a 39 year old or manipulated by him
jesus, all u did was describe saki from 177013
How dare you mention those damn numbers

177013? What does that mean
The numbers Mason, what do they mean?
NOBODY KNOWS
Hi, I have a very similar personality / past as Aubrey, and the only one difference is that I'm very shy and "calm" (stressed but not brutal even if I can't take injustices and have emotional issues) so yeah, I agreed with that headcanon
I know a popular headcanon is her being lesbian . To add on to that. Aubrey gets absolutely 0 (zero) pussy
She hates when anyone touches her pretty pink hair. . And secretly likes fluffy plushes
Crazy how the Omori overlords remove your comments for telling the truth
he’s the little dude we’ve been watching from start to finish of the game. And i thought you were an auby fan :(
I never noticed that Aubrey backwards is pronounced like eyebrow.
Blue/Blueself pronoumce. . Also, fun fact! My friend told me Blahaj is supposed to be pronounced Blue Hai. Therefore, are we to assume Femboy Auby has Blue Hai and Pronoumce?

AUBY 
My favorite character design is Aubrey in both versions. I like every main character though. Cpt Spaceboi gets my vote out
dw aubrey probably
dw aubrey needs to LEAVE
Dw Aubrey
Real life Aubrey
RW Aubrey
RW aubrey, i genuinely dont understand what people mean when they call her 'girlboss', she was a jerk. ik shes been through stuff and her feelings are totally valid but that doesnt excuse or justify her actions.
HS Aubrey
I want Aubrey to win because she's Aubrey but I want mewo to win because... cat.
Drop irl Aubrey?
Imma say it. IRL Aubrey
Knowing this community, it's either Aubrey or the cat that'll win
Real world Aubrey
Dw makes sense but she is like one of the most developed rw characters so yeah. auby supremacy
Dreamworld auby
Auby better win 
real world aubrey is annoying af, she's a b-word >:(
i gave aubrey toad's voice 
...I wanna meet your parents.
no
This is so sad
And it was either Aubrey or his grandma
It was Aubrey
It was both
I think it must’ve been Kel, Aubrey was still nice at 7
It was Aubrey
waaaaaa auby shoved me into the cake again

Aubrey is more of those rebellious teenagers that get called emo all the time
That is indeed fair.
Unpopular headcanon:. . >!He tried talking with Aubrey about what happened with the Photo Album, but she never gave him the chance to speak up, hence why Aubrey always shut him down.!<
>He tried talking with Aubrey about what happened with the Photo Album. . "when something ruined all my photos... I didnt say anything... I didnt want people to think it was you, Sunny."
It's a headcanon and Basil might have said it when he was scared. Also he tried talking with Aubrey multiple times, so there is some credibility here.
And Aubrey is Sussie
Glad I‘m not alone with that. . Especially Aubrey
...Its all fun and games till aubrey gets voted out
Idk dreamscape Aubrey, that seems like a vote that won’t cause any commotion
*Aubrey-Lover1328 has started typing*
Fuck
DESTROY RW AUBREY
NOOoOO WhYYYy
Again, all fun and games till aubrey gets out. . - no hate for aubrey, love her, but mewo deserves to win
Well come to a civilized agreement about who in the alliance will win, so it's not really a big deal if one of our allies gets voted out after we decided (we'll still crush whoever killed that ally tho. )
Tell that to Jawsum, Hero, and both HS Aubrey and RW Aubrey fans who are all part of the Army Bussiness Cats
RW aubrey?... this is really hard to choose °\^°
Dw Auby
RW AUBY
I think Dw Aubrey should GO
We need to make DW Aubrey turn into the toast!
Dream world/ head Space Aubrey.
Real world Aubrey!
irl Aubrey sorry I just don't like her:/
Real world Aubrey
Yea it’s weird he falls asleep in whitespace if you’re idle and in black space 2 Omori somehow has a dream about Aubrey even though he’s already in a dream
Ok, then. Guess the Fun Gang might have a chance then.
just coffee + run n gun Ralsei turn 1 GG
>just coffee + run n gun Ralsei turn 1 GG. . Ralsei dodge.
idk I think Aubrey could take Susie
If she actually uses her bat instead of just using it for intimidation maybe
Aubrey is a skinny teenage girl, and Susie is a huge fuckin dino monster with teeth much sharper than that sad little piece of wood could ever hope to be in its wildest dreams. If she could grab Kris’s twink ass by the neck and pin him up against a locked like a rag doll, she could easily send Aubrey blasting.
THE SIZE OF TWO SAUCE!!!! MICROSCOPIC!!!!!! THE SILLY!!!!!!!!!! THE AUBY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
. . (She is tiny. Microscopic, even.)
OH GOD. IT'S HAPPENIG! EVERBODY CALM DOWN!
NO EVERYBODY FREAK OUT
STAY FUCKING CALM
I think this is going to be severe on my wallet.. . Probably 45% of the pain being from shipping.
Same, i hope i can get them all 
Beat the other 20... thousand people in the race before they run out of stock for a quarter of a year.. . Good luck.
SO TRUE I forgot they go away super fast 
I gotta buy back to school shit soon so I hope these come out when I’m not broke af

Yay auby 
It's time to drink water 
Are they on the omo cat shop??
not yet, they’re presumable gonna tease one of the figures every couple days until they finally release
Aw man! Im so exited
sameeee, it’s spelt excited btw :)
Where was autocorrect when I actually needed it for once in my life :’)
Like they did with the plushies.
I HAVE TIME
yeah, everyone should mark their omori calendars and save up their allowances cuz last time things started selling out around the 15 minute mark and people immediately started moping about it as if 15 minutes isn’t extremely generous for indie merch i’ve seen stuff sell out in under a minute
that’s what they did with the plushes anyways

I need the Auby NOW

She is 2.3 chalk tall 
I NEED
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Great! Now we need the real world variants
Wait WHERE DOES ONE PURCHASE THESE
Aubrey amiibo when?
AUBY ‼️
. . Me when auby
AUBY 
INTO THE JAR. . 

Oh god, do we know how much these are gonna cost because I already want them all
I don't think there's a price yet
Gotcha. Thank you

do you know where I can get these?
You guys know how much its gonna cost ?
AUBY 
:D
Price?
Welp, into the jar she goes 

IT'S THE AUBY! THE MAILBOX WIELDER! 
AUBY!!!  AUBY!!!  AUBY!!!  AUBY!!! 
Time to pay $100 shipping cuz i live in middle of nowhere
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
iwanrhersobadltgtrrrrr
That's the perspective. It bugged me for a little too but her and Aubrey are just about the same height.
I mean its canon that Kim and Aubrey the closest person to each other. So I def think it works
Because Aubrey only deserves the **best**. . Also, I’m now one of FOUR that prefer Aubrey being with Sunny
Headspace Aubrey surely does (though technically that's Omori, not Sunny). It's not clear if real world Aubrey feels/felt the same.
I'm pretty sure headspace Aubrey is supposed to be a "perfect version" of her according to Sunny (or omori), since he likes Aubrey
True. That's also why she has a crush on him, but that doesn't tell us about the real Aubrey's feelings.
I mean, for RWAubrey [there's this](), an analysis on Aubrey's behaviour towards Sunny. . HSAubrey? Well, the essay goes into it, but on a surface level it's probably mostly Sunny's wishes, as he's the one that 100% has a crush on her
Kim steals candies and is a bad influence for Aubrey  ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)![gif](emote|freeemotespack|downvote)
That means... Aubrey is bisexual?
It seems so.
She is wounded Auby is fighting Russia in Ukraine
Can we like, not joke about wars?
There are two big ships that are possible (and not extremely worrisome) in Omori. Aubrey and Kel, and Aubrey and Kim. Considering I headcanon Aubrey as a lesbian (if only for the fact that it’s hilarious to me that a lesbian carried around an eggplant plush) there was one remaining.
How are these two ships more plausible than any of the others? Especially considering that Aubrey keeps acting verbally and physically aggressive towards Kel?
WHY IS AUBREY AND KEL THE POSSIBLE ONE. . And why did you never consider Aubrey and Sunny, the one that’s basically canon
Because Sunny is so deeply traumatized? Like it’s not even canon that Aubrey >!forgives him.!< At least it’s canon that >!Kel and Aubrey make up.!<. . Edit: fixed spoiler tag
Aubrey × Goth girl
Or is Kim smthn else? I'm brain damaged, so cut me some slack 
aubrey is holding kim, thats the explanation
Happy cake day! (Same day as Aubrey's, nice)
Best unknown timing I've ever had
Aubrey
Aubrey's older sister
Aubrey
that's it. . we let aubrey get away with the "gross color" shit, but this will not stand!!. . /j
FR
fr i could only tell them apart from Aubrey's bow at times 😭
>!Doesn't Aubrey use headbutts in the church fight though?!<
Yes
Yeah but my head is nowhere near as strong as hers, so this is the only way for me to be able to do it too
Headspace Aubrey also says the other way around.. . 
Headspacw Aubrey is into Omori, not Sunny, argument invalid.
Ah ok yeah i can get a little in to Aubrey and Kel (i forgot the ship name). Im more of Kimbrey fan, there was an old drawing omocat did that shows what seems like Aubrey kissing a lady. But i do quite like Aubrey and Kel as well.
Hey Aubrey is happy with Kim

A happy Aubey ia a good Aubey

Let’s keep auby, our queen needs to stay
No, auby wins 🥺🥺
DW Aubrey
DW Aubrey. I absolutely hate them.
Real world aubrey
Real world Aubrey get out
RW!Aubrey 
Aubrey.
I love all of them but sadly non-headspace Aubrey will have to go
rw aubrey!!! her feelings are valid but that doesnt excuse her being a jerk!!! justice for babil(and other potential victims)!
auby is a jerk i dont get why shes so popularshe has no reason to target babil and possibly any other innocent victims of her bullying. . edit: babil was justifiable and yah i get auby was redeemed but still!!!
This Auby stuff keeps making me think of how Aubrey-DW nuked her Reddit account recently and nobody knows why
Wait She Did?
Sadly yes, and none of us know why or what lead to it
Didnt She Cause A Lotta Drama?
Not really, heck even if we count the silly slides, it didn’t cause much, and that was months ago, she left this month
Rw Aubrey has a scary amount of votes. I don't like where this is going
GET RID OF THE FAKES!. . HS Aubrey, the real deal is better.

Okies
“You’re a weird color!”. -Aubrey
*gross
Oh right thanks
No but Aubrey is lmao
Nuh uh Aubrey is

That Aubrey has thick skin/is a tsundere or girlboss or whatever. . No shes a 16 year old abused kid who cries a fuckton and cant control her emotions
Omg same I hate when people depict her like a boring trope who beats up everyone, like she's not a neglected child who experienced a tragedy beyond her comprehension
At twelve too
Dude same, I'm addicted to reading Omori fanfic and this probably the most common trope I've seen for Aubrey. Right  next to her being an overly aggressive bitch or always justified.
Nah she is a tsundere by definition and a girlboss but she’s more than that.
Both are wrong.
Rage cries are still cries
I didn't say they weren't.
But those saying Aubrey was abused also imply it was something other than neglect
Ah, okay, my misunderstanding then
people reducing aubrey to her rage grinds my gears BADDDD. We get to see so many glimpses of who she is and what she goes through and i feel like most people go  “auby mad”
People who say Sunny and Aubrey have chemistry from headspace like that's not an Idealized Aubrey made to love him.. . Like fine whatever if you want to see chemistry in the real world but god damn don't include headspace.
Since when was there any evidence to suggest that aubrey is gay that isn't 2 ancient omocat art (I think I know which one)?. . Attacking (not sure if this id the correct word) people for thinking basil is gay, while believing aubrey is lesbian is extremely contradictary.
RW Aubrey
Nope the bunny hater.
Oop
Leafy?

You're fucking right

Polly or RW Aubrey

So this is the bodypillow we can find in the castle and have aubrey equip...
at least it's aubrey using it. imagine if this were equipped by the others in the group 
It got scrapped beacuse changing omoris gender would also change Aubreys gender. And considering how much work would be needed for those 2 paths, I think it was done to save time.
Should have just let it rock and made female omori gay lol
Aubrey is lesbian, Omori made a Twitter post with a image of Aubrey having a gf
lmao
Wait am I wrong? Someone told me that and I just took their word
nah that's not cannon, and if it is, it hasn't been confirmed
Oh ok
I fucking hate when reddit downvotes people like you.. There's nothing wrong with people not knowing something, and what makes it worse is that people downvote and don't correct the person who is wrong. . . I normally lurk on reddit, but I at least have the decency to correct someone (or try to) who may be wrong.. . Or at least downvote the person who doesn't make an effort to learn. You can be wrong all you want, but what matters is if you are smart enough to know how to change.
Downvotes aren’t necessarily angry reactions or ridicule, they can be a signifier that the comment is of bad quality
True, but if you're trying to learn/correct yourself, that isn't the most low quality out there. I mean, you can find a random ass comment chain on a lot of posts and those aren't downvoted.
Don’t really have a good reply, but I agree.
It was posted on omocats blog in November of 2014. Aubrey kissing a girl. Aubrey is not straight
Yeah but stuff from that long ago might have changed.
you're mother
Yeah what would they have had to change besides pronouns in the dialogue?
Battle animations, emotion portraits, battle portraits, pixel sprites, and cutscenes
Ok yeah I forgor💀about those
also if you change Omoris gender, Aubreys gender would change to the opposite sex
It COULD be a reference to the omoriboy universe with aubrey and stuff
like 6 damage. Make sure Aubrey has power hit and that omori has painful truth or sad poem. You'll be good then
How do you get painful truth by this point of the game,was i this underleveled?
you get painful truth at level 19. You'll need to swap it out. But Sad Poem works just fine if you're okay with sacrificing a bit of damage.
Sad bear and Aubrey angry head butting
i kinda feel like this post is just engagement bait for people to look at the aubrey drawing
Oh yeah I completely forgot about the picture, didn't pay much attention to it, was distracted by the actual questions. Yeah why the heck is that picture here? It's not relevant
probably 5 aubreys behind her tryna fight her
do the aubrey
wtf is that picture dude aubrey is 16 💔
The anti-prude in me wants to argue that it's normal for teenagers to go swimming
Nobody can stop artists these days 
Wait uhm... Is Aubrey pleasing herself against the corner of the table here or is it a bat she's holding?
more sexualized aubrey please
Damn Aubrey kinda bad i mean in this picture she is showing her bra. PS: this is the second time i said it on a post but again it's clearly a joke i'm not into fictional characters :) and if anyone says she's 16 then i'm gonna tell you i'm 15.
She's flustered because of all the close contact
fair enough
for what it's worth, she blushes like this on One Day left as well during the group hug scene. probably just angsty teen phase not used to being so close to people
yeah probably, a teen phase the more you think about it
She is still embarrassed to her old friends
lol maybe
She broke the 4th wall
*oh shi-*
oh hell no now she knows of our existence.
Wait for it to become a Monika scenario..
OH NO!!.
**GOD NO**
I feel Afraid now!.
And also they would hang out a lot as 11 year olds. Aubrey would describe her fondness for Sunny because he would “listen to [Aubrey] talk for hours”. Plus the final duet scene of them on the swing together
*She knows*
holup, what?
*something isn't right*
**she knows of our existence, she is watching us.**
holup
she will follow the same steps as Monika.
**WHY DO YOU PUT ME THROUGH THIS SUFFERING?!??!?!?!?**
Sorry Mate xd
np lmao
sadge, aubey need the hug
Embarrassed because of being thrown into a group picture I assume…?
maybe, i think its possible
She's tsundere !
*oh no-*
*oh yeah*
B-Baka
She's embarrassed
of?
she's uncomfortable
understandable
Not as uncomfortable as your momma. ***. ^I ^am ^a ^bot. ^Downvote ^to ^remove. ^[PM]() ^me ^if ^there's ^anything ^for ^me ^to ^know!
no
Probably the fact that >!there’s a literal zombie in the picture who just came by for a photoshoot and nobody seems to notice or care except her!<
yeah lmao
i wish someone would put their arm around me like that bro
i dunno, maybe if it was someone i was close too
She’s just tsundere
yeah someone else said that too. XD
Camera shy
that's one not many have mentioned
Human contact is akward
ikr
tsundere panic, that's it.
y
Been a while since they took pictures together, so she's nervous about suddenly being in one?
She's not used to physicsl contact maybe
been getting that one more now
She's embarrassed about being associated with those idiots
**oh no**, *angsty teen*
she's just unconfortable with the group hug it's pretty normal
She’s just tsundere
I thing Aubrey hit kel with baseball bat after taking the picture, one of my friends react pretty much the same with friendly side hug
yh side-hug is surprising
i mean, if auby's position are swap with someone, her confident could be strong but. . since kel hug her while basil (or someone else) took this photo, her confident drops a lot and her face is like that. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . &#x200B;. . lol
lmao
It's a headspace delusion
probably
SHE IS JUST FLUSTERED WHAT'S SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND??
i mean, she might not be
as someone who very closely relates to aubrey shes just flustered from all the loving support and close physical contact and also i blush when getting photos taken
She knows it's all fake. She's told someone's taking the picture yet she sees no camera man
ah, okay
>!idk man, that's a bit too sus, let's keep it pg, and act as if everyone is a barbie doll!<
I was around 19 i believe. i used to make them angry and wipe them out with Aubrey who was already happy.
"Make Aubrey hot"? 🤨📸
Ayo hit what 💀🤨
Literally did this yesterday, while in a call with some friends, and it wasn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be, honestly. Sad Poem -> Counter-attack -> Annoy Aubrey -> Heal Aubrey. Next turn you use some epic and ouchy move OMORI has -> Keep bonking the bear -> Keep annoying Aubrey and OMORI -> Keep Aubrey and OMORI at good juice, keep Kel and Aubrey at good health. Sure, it was kinda annoying, but Sweetheart was a bigger challenge to deal with.
wait lesbian? what about aubrey? we can’t just let her out and all! i mean who else are we gonna rely on the cooking?! 
FIGHT!
: So, let's say hypothetically, I gave you free housing and a new mom.. . : Which one of you sprayed painted all my stuff pink?. . : erm, I know you are a bit old for this, but do you want to have another tea party talk?. . : I'm proud of you.. . : So, ummm... are you free for the rest of your life?. . : You are me? Wow, I'm so cool
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|smile)
The first one is like 75% of post-good ending fanfics and I am not complaining about that fact
Good because I love it. It's so nice since they get to reconnect, repair their relationship, and the general understanding they have for each other, both having absent parents and doing terrible things, but can finally heal. The two people of the friend group named after plants under one roof and a found family? yes please!
What did the initial comment say :0
Huh, it's deleted? The text still shows up for me.. . Anyway, it's what everyone from the main OMORI cast could say to make her feel that happy.. . The first one is ": So, let's say, hypothetically, I gave you free housing and a new mom."
“Another tea party talk” insinuating that was a common thing hero and Aubrey used to do. . . Adding that to my list of headcanons
At this point im collecting headcanons like infinity stones
You are unbanned from free ham sandwich day
woohoo!

When you pet / groom your bunny they would return the favor by licking you or your bedsheets / pillows / anything that has your scent thinking it is you but mostly the bed since it’s the things that have your scent and reminds the bun of you
: Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we  can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover  this time…. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your  goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer.

I remember what happened the last there was multiple Aubreys 
What a nightmare that was
we are multiplying
they are plentiful. . is it a good idea to be scared of the potential numbers /j
hello evil minecraft its me charlie lance
on hard mode for the entire game. . Edit: Aubrey's wondering why the game's on two screens at once
Snuny Auby gaming
 Yes!
He might aswell be playing Kirby Canvas Curse or Super Star Ultra (True Arena) with Aubrey, whoever would beat Drawcia and True Arena (after Kirby dies they switch until Kirby dies again) 20 dollars or something idk
Auby is kyoot
AUBREY BECAUSE SHE IS SO ADORABLE
I just really like Aubrey as a character and like.. . Look at the silly.. . . . There is not a single thought between those eyes
the auby . it's cute and throwable
Aubrey! 
I like Aubrey‘s little cat mouth :>
Auby because she's cute
I like aubrey’s one because it looks like shes about to commit a crime
Aubrey. Those hair stitches have left nothing to rattle around in thrre
Aubrey, cuz she cute as hell, look at her.. . 
Auby
I like how cute Auby is
Aubrey because I like the details in her outfit
Aubrey because her smile suddenly makes me want to smile too
Auby. Her nightie is so big and it's so cute!
Auby because she cute
Aubrey and omori are both adorable 😭
Aubrey bc yeah
Aubrey. Cuz she's cute
I love Auby plush, she’s adorable
Aubrey because she looks like small bean in plushie form
Aubrey because she looks like small bean in plushie form
The Auby plush is so cute
auby because auby
My favourite one is Aubrey plush because her smile is everything 
aubrey
Auby cuz she looks adorable with that little smile (tho she is my fav character)
Aubrey's is absolutely adorable and perfect. I almosy got her but I decided I'm done with picking merch based on what looks the best instead of picking things with my fav characters.
Auby plushie is art 🫶
well I'm a girl and Aubrey is also a girl. I'm already gay so if she was real i'd be gayer. Am i the only one?
Aubrey
Aubrey.
Aubrey, she reminds me a bit about myself, aka. She beats her problems till they are no longer problems
bi for aubrey
Aubrey, both of them. DW Aubrey us cute while RW Aubrey is really relatable
Real world Aubrey.
The southern head butt girl in the real world.. I'm bad with names. I thought she was cause she helped Aubrey
Real life Aubrey
Thats Auby
auby got a lil bloated
too much water 
I don't know if this is accurate or not, but I think she abandoned them to work on OMORI (the game). I'm probably wrong, though... . . edit: I just realized that the girl next to Pretty Boy looks similar to RW Aubrey. That's a neat reference! 
Aubrey's bow looks more like inspiration or reference from this girl, rather than a coincidence. It's even tilted to her left
Now that I think about it, you're right! Thanks for telling me 
Ngl I thought it was Mincy
I’m pretty sure it’s more like Angel’s sister since she also  draws/paints with striped shirt and all
Same. Though I don't know if he necessarily "faked" it near the beginning, more like pushed the other thoughts away and focused only on simple happy things. Which obviously is what Aubrey is so mad at, that he's "ignoring" being sad, and it looking like he's not effected.
Aubrey is a plant and her parents plan to eat her once she grows
Also, Omori is in Omori
okay don’t get too crazy with the theories
Not a theory. If you run the game in TempleOS, then hold a copy of the bible upside down, drink 3.89 mL of Sprite, and recite the script to Talladega Nights in Tagalog, you will see it clearly. Everyone knows this
my guy, you forgot to state that this only works if you do it at 3:56am.
Lol
Ohhhh so that's why she's neglected, everything makes so much sense now
It's surprisingly common. Not popular, but if you look up "aubergine name baby" you'd see a few people debating about the name Aubergine and see it on baby name lists.. . My h/c is that Aubrey's famine is French and thought it would be cute.
I didn't realize that! I've only ever seen one tweet where she posted some Aubrey art and just said "Aubergine" but I swear she was memeing. That's crazy though ig ppl r named Clementine and things like that so maybe it's not that far fetched
The fact you mentioned Clementine as I was playing The Walking Dead has granted you my upvote, you based man . . And about her name, there's people out there that's named Aubergine, but I just guess she doesn't like it and everyone calls her Aubergine (extra points if it was Kel who came up with her name, and Aubrey's his). . My personal headcanon is her mother was at the hospital and they brought her an aubergine for lunch, and she just went "Aight you're now named Aubergine kiddo, get over it" 
that's exactly what I think as well. I can't and don't take it seriously, it was only really a title/caption for an aubrey doodle, which is too little to claim it's a canon fact
Aubrey + Mr plantegg = AUBERGINE
Aubrey aubergine reminds me of peko pekoyama
i wonder what different search term would bring up aubrey pictures 
CEO of racism

Intelligent specimen
Aubrey paid them off 
Yes, but what about. . Auby x ba t
Truw!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone blushes in it. It's just more obvious on Aubrey.
Aubrey is a full-blown tsundere.
Don't you worry, I understood your intention :-) I'm sorry I didn't make it clear.. I was just rambling about compulsive shipping.. . You caught a quite interesting detail; we can know Aubrey's character a little more thanks to It.
HOW TO PRONOUNCE AUBREY
Aub-ree
Aub or Oob?
Aub
God, this is hard!  Everyone has their own trauma and I can't exactly choose who to give therapy to.. . So, uh, I'm gonna narrow it down.. . If Sunny or Basil got therapy, they'd most likely end up in jail for murder/being an accomplice.  I don't wanna do that to my trauma children, so not them.. . Kel seems fine for the most part.  I believe that's because he was the least connected to Mari, but there may be another reason.  Either way, I believe he's okay for the time being.. . That leaves Aubrey and Hero, and while Hero loves Mari and is obviously hurt, Aubrey is still a child.  Hero is coping, albeit not very healthily, but Aubrey isn't doing so hot.. . So I'd give the card to Aubrey.  Besides, everyone else's parents probably care enough about their children to get them therapy, but it's clear Aubrey's mother lives terribly, and most likely doesnt have the money for therapy, and doesnt exactly care too much to get it.. . The girl deserves the free therapy card
Manslaughter, actually, and they were kids
You might want to put a spoiler warning there
Remind me how to do that
I only know how to do it on PC but edit your comment, press the three dots and the exclamation point in a box is the symbol for spoiler warnings.
Hero lost a girlfriend, Aubrey lost a sister
Aubrey was all alone, but she isn't anymore. At end of the game she has the most robust peer support network out of anyone. Sure they all got their own issues, but they've also all got each other.
tbh, I think Aubrey’s mom is actually abusive or smth like that but that’s only from the info Ik, but still, Aubrey rlly needs the therapy but I also wanna give it to Basil so bad :-:
All, but if I really had to only pick one, it would be Aubrey
Besides Sunny, it's an impossible contest between Aubrey and Basil.. . Kel is actually doing pretty good in the game, and while Hero is struggling, he is still doing okay.. . Basil is clearly deeply unstable with a lot of issues he is not dealing with well. Not to mention a lot of trauma and abandonment issues he shouldn't be expected to work through alone. I don't think him going to jail is an issue, so there's no reason he shouldn't get it.. . Aubrey lost her father and best friend back to back and likely comes from an abusive household. While Aubrey is too stubborn to curl up and blame herself, she is dealing with a lot of volatile emotions with nowhere to properly deal with them.. . In the end, I choose Aubrey because she's less likely to be able to afford a good therapist. If basil's family can afford Polly, they can get him a therapist. Aubrey's home likely couldn't even *afford* a therapist even if they cared.
aubrey. i don't think an explanation is required
OBV Aubrey.. . Like how does she live like that.
aubrey. i feel like she's the most average, realistic portrayal in the game of a suffering teenager.
Aubrey, I love Aubrey. She needs the best
Auby
Auby needs spme
I'd say Aubrey, Hero and Kel seem to have found a healthy way to cope, I would say Basil but Aubrey is alot more dangerous to society xD
Aubrey. She was living with neglectful parents while her old friends either shut themselves off or moved on. All she needed was support after what happened and she never got that.
also aubrey because she lost her father and a good friend
NOOOOOO AUBY DIED
Oui like Aubrey's jacket collar.
what if she just changes into her identical clothing aside from the collar. I have a friend like this who has like one or two kinds of clothing and the rest are copies, hes like a cartoon character and he knows this
Is the jacket collar really inconsistent? I just took it to have an inside liner made with a fabric that looks bright from some angles and dark from others.
>hat looks bright fr. . Maybe, I considered it inconsistent because the fight shows it's dark red & yellow but in some images it shows it's white & yellow.
Auby 
Somehow, all of the sprites have differences (mistakes) in overall design, which is odd, considering that they would be based off of previous images of said characters. ^(How the hell do you fuck that up?). . One of the reasons why people still haven't fully figured out how RW Aubrey's jacket should look like.
The Aubrey makes it ten times better
Auby, that's all I need
Ig it would be a lamp, my mac and ipad, sketchbook with drawing utensil, and mawi and auby. I think mine is really similar lol- but yea 
You expected Aubrey, but I was me DIO!
Aubrey's "We have the meats,"
The real life Aubrey burger they made that one time.
To be fair, both deal equally shit damage, the real winner is Aubrey with the baseball bat that can one shot anyone
People shipping him with Aubrey.
aubrey crawling on the criling like spiderman 
Aubrey told him to Google "blue waffle"

Aubrey Gene

There are two types of omori fans. . People who think Aubrey's last name is Ginne. . And people who think Aubrey is a nickname for Aubergine. . I myself am the latter, but I fully respect the other lol
I think her whole name being a pun is more fun than her first name being Aubergine, but ok
I mean yeah, I just never thought about the last name. . Definitely considering it tho lol
The Aubergine thing is a pun, it’s like naming your child Cucumber or Tomato.
Fr? That name was pure fan made from all i know….i thought Williams was Aubreys most popular
Well I use wherever sounds passively Irish unless we use her mom's name
Why is Aubry Irish now?
Aubry speaks in a heavy Irish accent now, sorry guys, its canon, nothing we can do about it.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Like… is it atleast Ireland-Irish?
Well my headcanon has her ½irish ½ argentine,
AUBREY FAZBEAR-☠️
#####Aubrey El Diablo
Diavlo mano 
Domi? 🇩🇴
Aubrey is Spider-Gwen confirmed
Almosy my exact HC save for Aubrey, nice.
Aubrey’s name is because she’s a second or third generation Italian immigrant. She never shows it though, because her parents would always argue in Italian every night, so she refuses to learn the language or culture.
I headcanon her name as Williams tbh.
I headcanon her name as Williams tbh.
Just wondering, is that photobomb art for your pfp?
No, it's Corrin, Felicia and Kana from Fire Emblem Fates as Lloyd, Yor and Anya from SpyXFamily.
Oh ok.
Aubrey is also ethnic Romanian
Aubrey Popa
I still think bout how this is the only reason game has strong language tag. Couldve used it more for like, yknow, Aubrey cursing, or maybe Kel. Or Aubreys friends.
My friend who’s coincidentally named Aubrey wanted me to play it and so I did. Now I’m an official enjoyer 
I found out from that one trypophobia meme, (i thought it was someone's oc or smth and i had no idea it was an actual game 😭) after that i saw a few memes and i think a shipping meme, I saw older aubrey and I was like "oh cool pink haired girl" then I found out it was a game that was an emotional roller-coaster apparently, but I still had no idea what it was about or who the characters even were. . a few months later my sister was like "hey what's omori?" and I was like "oh yeah that one game, should we play it?" Then we got it and entered completely blind. . ...annnd we got stuck in white space at the very beginning not knowing we had to pick up the knife and we somehow ended up looking at a guide because we're ignorant  but we were fine for the rest of the game... mostly
Back in 2020, my friends and I would often shitpost in discord and my friend sent an [Aubrey gif](). From there we started sending a ton of omori tenor gifs until I watched a [summary of the game]() (good ending) and impulse bought it.. . Best decision of my life. Almost 2 years later and I still can’t get enough of this game 
Aubrey would play roblox to scam and bully children in adopt me or something.
REALL OMG
New headcanon unlocked
Aubrey would play Bully
Underrated comment. Underrated game.
Headspace Aubrey definitely plays adopt me
Aubrey is definitely a Splatoon kind of gal
Aubrey has a gachatuber channel.
Basil plays Stardew Valley with Aubrey and Aubrey messes with his crops because she doesn't know how to play
Aubrey would probs play CoD
Aubrey would definitely play CoD and go full racer mode in the lobby chat
Aubrey would play Sims
Aubrey: dark souls 2
I think Aubrey would play Fall guys, mainly to push people :)
Aubrey's definitely going to play Doom Eternal. . . You don't have to think why
Saved his life only to try and kill him 5 minutes later, based Aubrey . . (Legit though thats a really interesting theory, would explain why he was looking for the hangout spot for seemingly no reason)
>!I’m gonna kill myself!<. . >!yeah NOT IF I KILL YOU FIRST!<
Or knowing Aubrey being thug carrying nailed bat, he might be scared of them regardless of what they do to him.
-He's been bullied for 4 years by these guys, so obviously he wasn't going to trust. -He seems to have a hallucination at the time.. -They don't seem to be very kind add that aubrey has a bat
Just Aubrey I think. So that the gang would equal out to three boys and one girl like male Omori’s route.
There is a scrapped boy Aubrey design that even has in game sprites in the code of the game iirc.
No, because being female is Aubrey's thing /s
Aubrey
>!Balcony!<


Close
Oh no
Till' death do we part

I arrived after blackspace, just got auby in my party, I'm gonna listen to you

Even better.
Personally auby is my favorite
I love it too  .   . but then everyone asks wtf that eggplant thing she got is
Mr. Plantegg is cute.. . Auby is also cute.
Yes but the public people give anxious thoughts
why

but they just cute
I kinda like Omori more cause Mewo (also Omori cool), but if it was my favourite type of milk it would be Aubrey
Cum


Cursed reply 
Aubrey!
Auby
i think the aubrey one is probably the cutest but i'm a huge aubrey fan so my opinion is biased lmao
AUBY
Auby
There’s no one I’d *hate* as a person but my favorite character is Aubrey and I have a feeling we’d argue a lot and wouldn’t be friends if I knew her as a person. A key way she deals with difficult emotions is by manifesting that into anger and taking it out on others. I simply don’t think I’d put up with it. If she manages to completely shift her coping skills in that regard, maybe I’ll feel differently.
It's the *violent* aspect that makes me sure I couldn't handle her. I would try very hard not to judge because she's got trauma....but if I didn't know that yea..I'd just steer clear of her in real life..  . It's sad really...
Yeah I feel the same. I think if she was an actual person I would just feel helpless. Even if I knew about her trauma and why she behaves the way she does, I think I would probably just feel unable to help her and end up just not being friends with her.
I TOTALLY agree. If I didn’t know her, and her, her bat, and her edgy gang came in with those goofy goober scooters...man’s bouta get a whole lotta shame from me.. . (pls don’t kill me auby)
Yes, I was gonna say Aubrey for similar reasons. I think she is a really excellent character as far as how the game shows her dealing with her grief. Her reactions are very human and, like most of the characters, she represents a very real way that actual people process difficult things in life. I have a lot of compassion for her and I think she deserves understanding and kindness, of course. But if I knew her in real life, I'd probably get frustrated with her coping mechanisms real quick and not want to put myself through being her friend. Because, honestly, it's painful to watch people you love hurt themselves and to be lashed out at when you try to help, and that's kind of where she was at for most of the game. I honestly relate, I've been similar in the past (minus the physical violence), so I don't blame her. I just wouldn't want to be on the receiving end.
personally i feel about her the same way i do my sister (and ironically enough aubrey is her favourite character). i love her because she deeply cares for her friends but she's at time violent (side note my sister just slaps a lot its nothing actually serious)
Aubrey.. I love her.. But damn she's annoying.
me when my parents are abusive and i'm abandoned by all my friends after someone who is essentially sister dies (i'm kinda annoying tbh)
She attacked her friends with a spiked bat
I don't think she ever actually swung the bat at anyone - it's for show. It's "more dangerous than a steak knife", after all, and >!Sunny used the knife on Aubrey which instantly ended the battle. If Aubrey used the nail bat Sunny would probably be fucking dead.!<
I think that’s just a plot hole because the spiked bat does look sick
if you read the in-game battle text, she actually headbutted them while holding a spiked bat.. . i dont know why she headbutted them instead of like, punching or kicking them, though...
erm... based???
Fair
Ngl Aubrey was annoying as fuck for this. She spoke like she was expecting everyone to cater to her. She outright told Sunny that she thought she probably should have been the one there for him during the swing scene. Like gee, >! the boy’s sister died, and he won’t leave his house, you just now think that you should have been there for HIM Aubrey? !<. . Sunny was the one who was completely abandoned by all of his friends, if you really think about it.
She pushed someone who used to be her best friend into a lake.
obviously she had a bad home life, and had issues in her life in general, but SHE WIELDED A NAILED BAT AT HER FRIENDS, so not all can be excused.
yeah but there’s a different between dangerous and violent and “annoying”
I love aubrey but realistically I probably wouldn't like/get along with her. 
Aubrey. The rest of them I think I *would* like as people irl. Funnily enough Aubrey is my favourite to draw & I’m gonna cosplay her in 2 weeks lol. . I wouldn’t *hate* Aubrey as a person but I wouldn’t get along with her. I could see myself getting along with any of the rest of them & I find myself relating to multiple of them & even have shared trauma with some of them (but to a lesser extent).
GODDAMMIT AUBREY WHERE THE HELL ARE WE 
>has Aubrey flair. . checks out
I used to make fun of Aubrey-flairs.... . Now I am one myself.. . The circle of life, I guess.
The circle of life: . . Eat moss - get eaten by moss
I love Aubrey but I would NOT love her attitude and the things she did if she would really exist 
Probably Aubrey. Or Kim. I don't deal well with bullies
probably aubrey just because of how she handles her emotions and most of the time it turns into violent anger
Aubrey, I love her character but personally I’d be so intimidated and would probably avoid her if she was a real in person
If everyone's answer isn't Aubrey, they're lying. She is just a straight up selfish bully. I love her as a character but like, IRL, Id wanna be so far away from her
As someone who was and still is bullied by schoolmates, Same.
Hey, it’s more complicated than that, and she does grow past it, but she was indeed rather insufferable due to her unhealthy coping and I would probably stay away from her if I didn’t outright fight her considering her terrible actions. I Love her for her development, not for how she was at the start
A person can't really change that much in like 3 days lmfao, she's still a shitty kid who hangs out with shitty friends
I don’t see what part of her development over those three days was unrealistic to you, but I am compelled to agree that usually it does not happen, and I as well agree that she was a shitty person who hung out with shitty friends and I personally felt an urge to punch each and every one of them in the face
Not really, my sibling is very much like her so I could stand her with periodic rests obviously
I disagree that with her being “just a straight up selfish bully.”. . She was a little girl who went through a severely traumatizing event and had no shoulder to cry on, likely not even her parent’s. Everyone started to leave her and so she became resentful and grew a tough exterior. Given her circumstances, it was probably the only way for her to cope.. . I think if I spent enough time with her, I could learn to like her. After all, the hooligans may be a bunch of bullies themselves, but they clearly care for Aubrey in a way that isn’t out of simple fear or respect. I’d wager that she’s still very sweet if she gets comfortable around someone.
Aubrey. I wouldn't hate her, but I would not feel comfortable around her at all.
Probably Aubrey
Aubrey
Aubrey. I'm sorry girlie
This seems to be the popular answer, but I think I wouldn't get along very well with Aubrey. I actually don't *love* her as a character, but I do like her, and I think that she's very well written. While I would understand why she is the way she is (or try to, if I didn't know her), I literally cry when I get yelled at and I just can't/don't know how to deal with angry people.
Lol prof checks out
Aubrey. People with anger issues stress me out
RW current Aubrey. I love her, she's a well done aggressive character, but I can't stand people like her in real life.
Calm down, Aubrey
RW Aubrey probably
Aubrey
aubrey. i love those kinds of angry traumatized characters in fiction but being around people with a ton of angry unhealed trauma is not great. i say that as someone who is one of those people.
Aubrey, 100%
Aubrey, emo chick is scary and mean
I was coming in with Aubrey as a hot take, but that actually seems to be the most popular answer. . I feel like I would prejudge her as a bully. Which kind of disappointments me. I should be less judgemental and more compassionate
Aubrey. Love her, but she was kind of an @ssh0le both in headspace and the real world.
aubrey.. just aubrey.
Aubrey
Mine would be Aubrey. I had a terrible experience with bullies and I don’t think personal struggles justify aggression towards others in any cases. If I happened to meet her irl, I will do my best to avoid her save the victim, and perhaps stand up against her if I was strong enough rather than trying to like her.. . With that said, I do empathized with her in-game character. While I do had an experience with bullies, there was a time that I turned myself a bully towards one of my old friend due to betrayal conducted by that person. Aubrey also felt betrayed by everyone she loved when she needed them the most. I was filled with hatred and confusion from that betrayal, so I burst it all on him while also persuaded everyone in the class, including my teacher, to gang up on him (everyone, save me as last straw for him, are already hate him at that point). . . It was liberating, tbh, but when looking back to it, I was no different than him or anyone that hurt me before. Perhaps Aubrey felt similar to me.. Mad, confused, and lonely. At least she could reconcile with them in the good ending.
someone already pointed this out, but yeah, it's how auby manifests her emotions into a fit of anger and takes it all out on others that i wouldn't be able to properly help her out with. and also, becoming a bully is not the best way to cope. yes, she's still got a lot to learn, yes she's been traumatized, but this still isn't it.
Aubrey, she reminds me of someone I don't like.
Aubrey
Probably RW Aubrey 
Aubrey. She's a bitch.
Aubrey. . In real life, I would not like a gang lord .D
Kel. I wouldn’t hate him, per say, but he’s the closest I would get to “disliking” anyone in the friend group.. . Out of all of the friends, he had the least empathetic reaction to the incident. He may have been the most distant from Mari emotionally, but how he responded was very inconsiderate of his friend’s feelings - particularly Aubrey’s. . . Sunny and Basil were traumatized and had good reason to distance themselves. Hero was heartbroken then had to go off to college. All the while, Kel coped very well with what happened and yet decides to check out and go make new friends instead of being there for Aubrey. I don’t really blame him for doing this after how Hero responds to his supportive attitude, but, years later, he has the gall to tell Aubrey that “we used to be friends” and treat her as if she was the one who left everyone else to be a punk bully. It comes across as very narrow minded.. . Plus, he’s really high energy and I’m anything but. I would never be able to keep up with him.
god I loved that moment when pin becomes aubrey-dw and began to destroy the whole world
It's half canon since we know Snnuy likes Auby, but her feelings are only speculative.
truth
Want to hear something embarrassing i did?. . So there is this Aubrey mod being made where Aubrey was like omori right?. And i saw a scene where sunny was really shy around her and mari was being smug (i think)?. . And i left a comment saying it looked cool and sunny and Aubrey where so cute,(something like that) and then someone was like. . “Sorry to break it to you, but Aubrey is gay in this”. . And i was like, wow that’s embarrassing..ah well it should be fine!. . And then the goddamn creator commented on my fuck up……..and i was so goddamn embarrassed . . Worst of all that dragged in a bunch of toxic weirdos to integrate the team about sunburn, that made me want to rip my eyeballs off ngl
The fact the creator of it called you out LMAO omfg, poor Pin . . I don't think I'd find the initial fuck up embarrassing but damn, they REALLY called you out for that and brought even more attention to it, that's rough man 
[i found it]()
Honestly wasn't even that bad tbh, don't worry about it dude  except that dude further down randomly bashing ships. THAT was weird 
Yes.. . 1. It cute :>. 2. Not hating on others, and ships don't have to be, at all. But I do feel like it's the most canon non-canon ship of all. . Sunny obviously still has a crush on Aubrey, as evidenced by the fact that, well, he didn't change a bit in those 4 years. He was literally stuck in the past. (And also HS Aubrey, ofc). . People usually point at the Knife in THREE DAYS LEFT to say Sunny doesn't like Aubrey. *Like.* ***Dude.*** Sunny's been living in an RPG for the last four years of his life. Of course the first thing he does after seeing an enemy is attacking. ^(Also, shut up, you can avoid using the knife. Skill issue lol). . We don't have that much evidence of Aubrey, but there was a document showing things that could point towards *a feeling.* ~~I'll put the link here later if I find it again/remember lol~~ [*Edit: Here it is!*](). . Anyways, having at least 50% is already more than any other ships could say, with the possible exception of Sunflower. ^(snuy just gets all the bitches lol). . 3. Aubrey wouldn't be as unforgiving towards Sunny, as I explained in [this reply](). . 4. The Swings. Aubrey sees Sunny as someone trustworthy, enough to have told him even about her house life. *Nobody else knew about it.*. . 5. Shyboy X Tomboy. Shall I say more? /hj
All the numbers in your comment added up to 69. Congrats!. .       1.     + 2.     + 4.     + 50.     + 3.     + 4.     + 5.     = 69. . ^([Click here]() to have me scan all your future comments.) \. ^(Summon me on specific comments with u/LuckyNumber-Bot.)

And this is why this entire comment's argument is correct
NICE 
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO 
I wish i was shyboy so i could have shyboy x tomboy releation. Too bad im mentally ill and violent
Be trans, become the tomboy
No.
Yes, It feels.. organic in terms of progression and development. They both have changed and grown quite a lot, due to the great drama, and that bounds souls. It's still not as clear on how Aubrey reacted to his confession. It's certainly cute to think about.
Yes, there’s a whole article in the comments here, one of the main things is that sunny has a perfect replica of Aubrey’s bed in headspace and knows her pet rabbits name.. . So he was the only one who saw Aubrey’s house.
That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a crush, though. You can remember your friend’s stuff without that. But still sure, he did like her as a kid so
OK so I can't remember necessarily everything. Where is it shown or stated he has a perfect replica of Aubrey's bed. And and I mean its not stated that he's the only one. He might know her pet but you could also say that might be because of Mari too. If were going with beds as a basis I mean Basils is the only one he mentions as comfortable besides his own
Im not a fan. I still hate Aubrey bc I am a victim of intense bullying and now I rarely ever leave the house. Aubreys insults about Sunny living in a bubble really pissed me off
Yeah, Aubrey reminds me a lot of some bullies I used to have
I’d say there is a LOT hinting at real Aubrey feel feeling the same, but a lot of that can change after the truth comes out
I hate it-. . But that's cause I hate Aubrey and her "redemption.". . I feel like their personalities before day 3 were so opposing that it couldn't work well as a dichotomous relationship.
I don’t hate it, but I just can’t see it. I know Sunny used to like her, Aubrey undetermined. But at the time the game takes place? They feel too different to be compatible romantically. If it pops up, I’ll still think art and stuff is cute. But I’m more partial to Aubrey and Kim, and Suntan.
personally i don’t like it on a romantic level at all bc i don’t see aubrey as liking men 🤷🏼‍♀️
Fair! i personally see Aubrey as bi! . . there also good as close friends 
i'm so sorry to be *that person*, but... . they're*
 im going to feed you your own heart
i dare you 
If you don’t want to eat it, can I have some?
ofc! sharing is caring 
Yaaaay  meal time
Mhm no, I don't like it at all, maybe because Aubrey is my least favorite of the main group.. . I kinda,maybe, prefer almost all the other legal ships over it
Sunny shipps himself with Aubrey,but i get the feeling Aubrey likes him too
i do lowkey see Aubrey as bi ngl! 
I like it. Its basically canon and Aubrey still definitely has some feelings . . Although i dont know how they would be post truth
Yeah and to me after the feeling of abandonment that Aubrey feels plus the whole bullying part I can't see it ever happening soon
i personally think auby and omor is canon pls no hate
Honestly, I just like tsundere Aubrey
I like it and at the same don’t I think it’s kinda cute but if I look the game I can’t see these two together mostly now that Aubrey have that personality and probably hate him after knowing… the truth 
For me i dont really like this ship, the reason being that The relationship that Aubrey and Sunny had before four years is totally destroyed, aubrey comes to hate us even, and yes, during the three days we rebuilt it but only at a very superficial level and it doesn't reach that depth that they had before Mari's accident. HOWEVER¿Is the ship possible? Totally, time heals in the end. But I feel that there are other ship that are more feasible (COF SUNTAN COF). . Am I bias because I'm gay?. . Totally so don't give me so much attention and mostly have fun with this kinda things, this is the reason why i dont like it but in the end u think what u most like :D
I don't like shipping, and aubreys a dick in my eyes
I will buy the first real world Aubrey figure and no one will stop me
I wonder what you’re gonna do with that figure /hj
:(
I’m sorry it was a joke :( I sincerely apologize if that offended you!
OMG UR TOO NICE I JUST DONT HAVE THE EMOTES BECAUSE IM ON MOBILE
I had the same thought!! I would die to buy a rw Aubrey 💗
HOPEFULLY!!! I NEED A RW AUBREY SO BADLY
If its like this im bankrupting for that aubrey vinyl
It would be so cool to see a real-world Aubrey version!
Kirby’s Dreamland (Auby forced him to play it) 
30-50$. Maybe. They could be 50-70$. But I want an auby. No matter thy cost 
I ignored Aubrey the first night. Is that bad?
What.
I have too many questions after finishing the game
Ask me instead because OP seems a little incompetent.
All of my questions (for now) are there under theirs
The photo is from the Omori route which is started when Kel comes to your door. Instead of going outside and doing all that stuff with him, you stay inside for the whole game. The photo is also exclusive to the console version of the game. There are other endings you can get in that route that are kind of similar to ones that you can get in the main route (Sunny route), mainly just with a slightly different context more than being actually totally different. The main thing of the Omori route is additional headspace content.. . I'm not sure what is meant by ignoring Aubrey on the first night. Your actions related to Aubrey don't make a difference in how the story plays out, period.
When sunny is first awake, if I remember correctly, I was downstairs, and then Aubrey was knocking on the door, but then I ignored her.
Oh I see now, that's not Aubrey who "knocks" but it's actually Mari.. . Just watch this video to see what happens if you do open the door:. . 
Thank you
I’ll answer them then
Racist Aubrey strikes again!. . Probably my favorite joke from the game, if you think about it longer it becomes funnier
Omori and RW Aubrey fr 
The discrimination power couple.
“YOU’RE A GROSS COLOR!” - Aubrey
Aubrey - Arson
aubrey for being racist
Aubrey would get cancelled for plotting a coup on one of the biggest cities on Earth which has a secret police force that she manipulates to her advantage 
Aubrey wouldn’t care if he said that, since Aubrey has already canonically called Kel a gross color to his face.
Some of them are shocked because of what he said, but Aubrey is shocked because he said it when Kel is there
They saw the comments on the “how did Aubrey get stuck” post
the expired orange Joe scene literally grosses Aubrey out so much that she can't say anything except the two measly words "you're...gross...."
And yet everyone only cares about Aubrey 
Suffering from success
The best dude from Aubrey’s crew was the tall quiet dude who never says anything he’s so chill
With kel maybe? I mostly use omori and aubrey to attack. Aubrey skills have damage bonus when angry, omori has that 3 slashes skill which would benefit alot when angry
Yeah but enemies take less damage when sad, both because of defense and juice
Oh right, they do use juice to block damage. But angry is effective against sad so maybe its still good. Idk i guess happy is better then
I Used Angry A Lot To Kill People Quickly. . I Would Ge Aubrey And Omori As Angry As They Could Be, And They Would Destroy Everyone
Anger, auby was my main all the game, so mr whale was a pain in the ass
I used to make Omori sad and stab, make Aubrey angry and head-but and make Kel happy . . I later swapped to make Omori angry and used hack away, Aubrey neutral(?) and used counter
Aubrey always angry . Omori always happy. The other always neutral
Pissing off Aubrey and Omori then having the two wail on a sad enemy was my GOAT strategy.
A lot of people enjoy Mel bombing, but I prefer getting everyone as angry as they’ll go, using contract with omori, and then using ricochet, hack away and [insert Aubrey’s 3xattack skil], I found that if you do that for just one round of attack it deals somewhere around 1400 damage, and that can increase with items (this is usually around level 20-30 on the omori route)
anger is my go to. aubrey’s headbutt slays
Anger and sadness (unless it's an emotion gimmick boss). . anger for aubrey's headbutt and sadness for Omori's stab(?)
I used angry a lot for Aubrey's headbutt early on, but I would always make Omori as sad as possible for the stab move.
Angry auby headbutt spam
I just kept making Aubrey and omori get angry for harder but later on i just made omori manic all the time
Angery Auby headbutt strats 👍
anger tbh. gave aubrey the punching bag from last resort and just let her headbutt everyone to death.
Angry Aubrey does work
Combat: make Aubrey as angry as humanly possible. Give enemy clinical depression. Headbutt to victory
Sad for omori, angry for aubrey, neutral for everyone else.
Angry Aubrey is OP asf
Also sad omori + stab
With the items and abilities I got happy seemed like the easiest to use. Aubrey makes the party happy, Kel makes the opponent angry, Omori uses some attack that does extra damage against a happy opponent and makes them deal less damage, then Aubrey draws the attacks while Hero heals her. Also I had an item that made Omori start as happy each fight I think, so since Hero healed I just needed to use that ability where Aubrey makes herself and another (Kel) happy.
I usually made everyone happy with team spirit with Aubrey when I didn't have confetti or something and made the boss mad
I loved to see Auby happy and see the Omor-Auby combo
I use happy because it allows extra speed, Aubrey makes it really easy to get with team spirit, and it completely destroys angry allowing for maximum damage and defense.
used the "enemy sad, omori+auby angry" strat for the entire game. Used happy like 3 times
Angry for Aubrey
Happy! I used pep talk with Aubrey and annoy with Kel and then Omori went to town with Happy Slice or whatever and Aubrey hacked away with power hit
It can depend, but I usually go happy or sad. I’m only on my first playthrough (I’ve seen other playthroughs before), so I’m learning my strategy as I go lol. Right now I usually aim to use Aubrey’s Mood Wrecker or Omori’s Mock, depending on how the battle’s looking. Will occasionally go angry though, just because megaphone makes it very easy to switch to lol
I find it depends on the emotion of the enemy but I tend to default to Omori being sad and Aubrey being Angry since I like using Stab and Headbutt a lot (but this might just be because I keep restarting the game because I forgot to fight a boss) and also I kinda keep going into areas under-leveled so Sad is so tanky-
okay but can we talk about how fitted up aubrey is holey moley
real agreed
Aubrey's birthday is the same as my little sister's!
aww happy birthday!!
Thanks, on behalf of my little sister lol!
he shot aubrey to death 😛😛😛😛

missclick 
“You always ask to look at my photo whenever I take any pictures of AUBREY. Do I... maybe... sense a little crush?”
pov: Aubrey is in a suit
is it....Aubrey?
Looks like Aubrey to me
. . DEFINITELY aubrey. i mean, look at those two pictures of her on the wall. There are some other characters too but it's clearly aubrey that's the favorite
Definitely Aubrey
yall love aubrey
Stay far away from aubrey
Dam, so your favorite character is Aubrey right?
So jealous, need that RW Auby
They made a distance between eyes wider for some reason. This is why they had to make their heads wider too. I really hope my Aubrey isn't gonna be like this!
Aubrey is actually one of the normal looking ones so you should be fine!
I think you like Aubrey 
congrats on the Bsl! I'm waiting for my Auby and Bsl :\]
Oh yeah that also happened to me and my Aubrey shirt, it’s weirdly long and it’s kinda awkward most of the time
You have a lot of Mari and Aubrey theme things. . . . . But I gonna go with Auby
Auby
is it auby???
Aubrey
Yes indeed
I have a feeling it might be Auby but, just a wild guess. Made it pretty hard honestly.
I\`m actually wondering. Is it MARI or AUBREY? I\`m guessing its AUBREY???
Yes it Aubrey lol
Ah okay
AUBY MY LOVE
Lol
Is really normal to have three Aubrey plushys
yea ofc
DM me so I can send you my Aubrey lol
Its pretty normal to me...  I got none
(the dream aubrey in the corner casually joining in)
Aubrey haram moment
aubrey is... haram...?. .

Nah you need one more Aurbey and it will be a squad of Aubreys
Aubrey’s eyes look terrific ngl
you can never have too many aubrey plushies
Aubys

How quickly do we think they'll sell out again? I'll be at work at this time but hopefully I'll be able to sneak away for a sec to grab an Aubrey and omori...
You'll probably have timeat WORST they'll be out in a few hours but even that should give you time, and that's doubtful to happen anyways hope u can snag some! :3
I ended up having my lunch break coincide with the release time, so I managed to grab them both :3 thanks again !
YAYYYY :D
I think OP likes Aubrey
is it aubrey?
all of your aubrey stuff. . including mr plantegg
i’d rather kindly ask for RW auby plsuh, i need one RW auby plsuh rn 😭
The auby plushies and the something figurine
All of it, but if I had to choose, probably faraway Aubrey plush, faraway Aubrey acrylic stand or mr plantegg

Aubrey used headbutt against wall
Aubrey plush looks so cute
I will eat your auby
Watermelon sounds really good right now
Aubergine sounds very good rn 🍆🥵
🤨
This is you you're the girl that loves 🍆
No comment
There was a comment. Aubrey must be not letting you see that asshole.
this is why you don't let Aubrey handle the delivering of your baby
Aubrey miscarriage😔

RIP... So now what? Do you just not have an Aubrey that you paid for like...?
The delivery failed for maybe a day or a few hours but I got them the next day
Ah Okay
Do you have the aubrey one?
Hey I'm working on my Aubrey shrine rn trust
Just looking at this makes me want to start an Aubrey collection
i think your favorite character is aubrey
Very nice, Glad you completed your Omori collection. Especially an Aubrey collector coming from one, hee hee
. . My auby and your aubrey could be close friends
auby!!
I'm waiting for my aubrey for the new year!
great! my aubreys say hi :). . 
My too). P.s. - Aubrey with glasses on your avatar is so cute
thank you! i dont remember the artist unfortunately :(
. . Aubrey gang
YEEEAA!. . 
oh you fully made her bald oh ok . . my aubrey says hi to your aubrey 
So you're the reason Auby Plushes went out of stock . . 

aubrey? more like coolaubrey amarite
Welcome Aubrey to the world
exactly!! i agree with this. i love aubrey 🫶
Auby
The wallet is infinite, Aubrey
I need to start my Aubrey collection
Aubrey will beat me if I let her out. And if she's in a box, it's only fair everyone is in a box.
Ahh so it’s Aubrey’s fault
NOO AUBREY IS GETTING CRUSHED
Considering he only exists in headspace. . 
...do i even have to say it?
Nah I think it’s obvious.
AUBY GANG!!!
Omori looks like he's about to murder all of them

Omor

Might be basic but I love the blank stare that Auby has (Its time to drink water)
Aubreyyy
Kle
 DONT MAKE ME CHOOSE
babil
Maurice
Omori . Though I want to see all of them in a theme appropriate cup
Omor probably. He's so cute, but menacing
aubrey
Omor
None I hate plastic
That's stuffing though
it's all made from polyester isnt it?
I focking bought an Aubrey, Thank you
Please, let us know as fast as you get an answer. I ordered Aubrey and now I'm KiNdA nervous.
Will do. Chances are your Aubrey will be fine. Kel is the plush with the most defects, I don't think I've seen any for Aubrey. That or people just aren't talking about it.
Little Auby! 
Lil ‘brey 
Auby 
MY BABYYYYY!!! 
OOPS WRONG COMMENT-
HAHAHAHAAHHAHA
# OHOHOHO . . Great. I can’t unsee it lol
# OHOHOHO. . Great. I can’t unsee it lol 
Wow, where did she go? There's only a pink and purple flower left. Such a beautiful drawing.
That’s so pretty! I wish I have one too:3
AUBS. . IT DA AUBS 
AWWWW
Really cool 👍👍
the aubrey smile lol
Being a punk  and street girl be damned, girl still love a romance.
Tecnically she aint a punk yet
It's tommorow today, buddy
I’m sure she will keep up such an innocent demeanor in the future! Surely nothing bad will happen!
Aubrey is acting very out of character
For me it's really Aubrey bringing out all her hidden frustrations and disappointments at her ex friends for abandoning her.. . It expresses the feelings more strongly than the one in the game, but it is still canon Aubrey.
Forgot about the aubrey card (it was inside the book). . 
Are they in every book or only pre release ones ? Cuz you got one in store
they're in every book rn but after a while they won't be, since these are complimentary items only for the first set of published books I think?
Oh thanks !
Why is she wearing a robe
Also, she looks like she's trying to blow up the watermelon with her mind powers.
She's wearing a yukata I believe, commonly worn during the summer.
Still Aubrey. . . The queen of the Simp
Aubrey told them what happened to the photo album 🤷‍♂️
I do feel like some of these changes were made to emphasize how hurt and abandoned Aubrey felt by her friends, but there’s definitely better ways to do this.
I can see that, but honestly, it sucks that they basically erased her more empathetic side to achieve this result. Like you’ve pointed out, there could have been a better way to show how hurt she was.
Is snuy trying to snap Aubrey's neck?
I wish lol
I enjoy that Aubrey apparently just carries around a tissue in case someone starts crying.
imagine if it's for omori lol
Aubrey boutta pull what's called a Yoru moment
Aubrey is so sweet!
it's a reference to JJK where one of the MC's teammates is killed by someone who can shapeshift other people (that's why you can see Aubrey's eye)
At first I thought auby was kicking his crotch for whatever reason
literally 1984
Aubrey's true redemption arc (she's no longer racist)
No more racism and no more shipping. . 
Another adaptation ruined by woke🤬🤬
Ruined by woke, or a translation of a translation?
"I may be a bully, but I'm not racist!"

Your a gross color or something
Aubrey is not racist, 0/10 lirerally unreadable.
YOURE A GROSS COLOUR
LAME
If they make an anime, they need to add that line back
The woke mob has come for Aubrey
We did it Patrick, we've eliminated racism!
We did it guys, we cured racism
I’ve made Aubrey properly racist a few days ago already. . . . Here ya go
Damn
I agree
They ruined the best part
That one hurt a bit
You see... Auby will do whatever to get spikes on her bat 
HAPPY CAKE DAY
AHHH TYSM!
I did NOT expect Aubrey to weld nails to her bat bravo. Also kel requesting that they *don’t* give her a bat and everyone turned him down despite his multiple injuries was also funny.
give it sick axe blades. . 
I like how impractical a nail bat actually is, makes me headcanon that Aubrey knows that but chooses to weld nails in the bat anyway because it’d scare the shit out of Kel even more 
i love this cute format  . pls make more
JongGoon! Its been a while since you came in my feed! I missed seeing your content! Your art has improved so much! Love it, keep going! <3
Thanks so much! Yeah, I only update my long comics about once a month these days, so it probably did feel like a while! I really appreciate you checking in and supporting me. I’ll keep doing my best!
No problem! Anything for my favorite artist! Take care and take as much time as you need with your comics!
awesome
Damn it 
Girl thinks she's in an edit
Now THAT’S an insult if I’ve seen one.
Your name reminds me of someone
. . How Aubrey felt after saying that.
Aubrey 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐁𝐨𝐬𝐬 (tiktok edit)
I just realized but this is the perfect gif to represent how she felt after that. . 
"TEAMMATES! FRIENDS! TO HELL WITH THAT!"-akechi
Me watching Aubrey after >!she goes psychotic and summons FUCKING LOKI and also getting a much better and more evil design!<
too bad aubrey is legit trash living in attic
Aubrey getting hit by Sunny’s shrine extension technique:. . Cut that bisects the girl
Dismantle
I mean, at this point she might as well be.
She is just being silly 
She thinks she’s Scissors.. . 
Shadow the Hedgehog is her comfort character
Aubrey be sitting in the back of the class with headphones on while *I Am… All of Me* plays on repeat like it’s the most thug-gangster ass-shit
Nah she’s on the Sigma Grindset😎
reasons why I love aubrey
Hurts to see, man ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|cry)
Bro talking like a Manhwa protagonist.
What did you say? Do you think she cares?. . 
i hope she becomes an anime character 🙏🙏🙌
I love the amount of Mangaubrey slander
I feel like they should be taller…aren’t you almost at your max height once you’re 16? Why do they look 10 here if Aubrey’s depicted in her post-(THAT THING) fit?
🖕    
Manga Aubrey just sucks as a whole. Kinda sad to see it.
. . "manga aubrey sucks" mfs when they see the fear in her eyes in this specific part:
Tfym Manga Aubrey sucks?!
In the Game She was Tough but she wasn't really the type of person to kick the shit out of someons while they are Having a Panic Attack on the Ground then deliver a fucking Anime Villain Speech
But it’s anime on paper?
That's what you get with edgy tsundere characters
. . Aubrey rn
Sis boutta start monologuing 💀
\*Numb by Linkin Park starts playing\*
Dog you aren't gonna believe this BUT i think she might be talking like a fictional character 
she says "bad morning"
When you have a nail bat you can be as dorky as you want
She thinks she Goku, nah nah Goku solos negative difficulty, entire verse wiped out.
Aubrey’s handwriting here is the same as the one on her pinwheel instructions sheet! . . 
Aubrey got that typewriter type font
A bit late but it’s still my headcanon that Aubrey writes in all caps
Pretty mixed.. . I like their take on the story and characters, but I do feel like they went a bit overboard with Aubrey. . . I also don't really like the structuring of the headspace/real world segments as well as the lightning fast pacing of it all too.. . I really like the art style though, I love Basil's design in particular. I like how they gave him big double eyelashes, as a guy with big eyelashes myself, I see this as an improvement. And don't even get me started on the faces he make.. . Though I will say that I don't really like how the hair is done specifically on Mari and Aubrey. Like, it just goes all over the place in the worst way possible and just looks weird, especially with Aubrey.. . So overall, it'd say it's a 7/10. Not bad, but it's kinda of a confusing mess.
I like that they went overboard, better room for character development
every aubrey panel in this art style is a gift and proof god is real and he loves us
Might be a hot take, but i think it’s fun. It isn’t meant to be 100% faithful, they probably have a limited run time too. Aubrey did get watered down in ch 1 but she got better in ch 2.
Auby :3
Very cool Aubrey card
✿ Peace be upon you & good morning! This is so pretty \~ :\] Aubrey looks so…*pretty.* ( now I wanna see the other cards too though. ) thanks for sharing,. . 
Bro Aubrey is so cute 😌
Someone already disliked the fact that >!Aubrey threw the photo album out before the church scene.!< Personally, I think it makes the scene a lot more impactful >!as Kel might storm into the church fuming, knowing Aubrey threw the photo album out.!<
i honestly think it’s better that she threw away the album before going into church as to show that while she seems upset about throwing it away, she states in-game that she goes to church to “find peace”
That one page with Aubrey was honestly really sad I feel bad for her
I love how >! Aubrey's emotions are shown more explicitly to the reader !<, it makes it more digestible to people experiencing Omori for the first time and makes it sadder for people who already played, seeing >! her hesitate and knowing why !<
This chapter is def a lot better. I mean we were speed running in that first chapter but this one definitely started to flesh stuff out a little more and remove some of the more slow sections. . . Tho it is interesting at the differences like how >!the whole tutorial first section of the game appears here after the first Aubrey fight than the first part of the game, and interesting that Aubrey throws the book away immediately now and then goes to the church instead of her still having it all day.!<. . >!Also i swear they made the handholding after Basil disappears gayer. The extra frame showing them start to hold hands. Yes I know I'm delulu just shh!<
How did I not catch on soon as the lily went missing. . Also imagine an interaction between Aubrey and Jesse
pink!
Personally, I think Aubrey doesn't share the feelings but may have when she was younger. Mainly because I don't really do shipping other than already confirmed stuff.
I personally believe this evidence disproves your first claim, but it's all up to speculation. . [link]()
That doesn't necessarily look like like it, there's a lot of explanations as to why Aubrey would be looking at Sunny, but I won't deny that it's possible.
It was REALLY fast paced and it made Aubrey look like a bad guy
tbf the game does make Aubrey look bad at the beginning too
I havent played the game in a while, but i dont remember Aubrey immediately hitting basil to the ground and threatening to hit Sunny too, there was atleast some dialogue i think. The game does make Aubrey look like a bully but i feel like the manga made her look worse, idk
Isnt at this point aubrey is SUPPOSED to look like the bad guy? I havent played in months so i dont remember much
I think it made Aubrey look like the game should have looked honestly. The implication that she never uses her bat is cute in the game but the battles should be quick and brutal as in the real world. I love how in the manga the knife cut was really felt, while in the game it might aswell not have happened Aubrey just healed it off she ate some Combo Meal I guess. Aubrey's seem in the game as a villain at first aswell, with the only difference being she's less intimidating.. . For the fast paced, I can feel that but I don't think a slow paced manga would work very well. I mean, the main problem that most have with the game is that the dream sections drag on, so it makes sense to make it a little snappier cutting content from there (and honestly, cutting the phobia may seem dumb at first because the encounter is really fucking cool... but the payoff to the phobias ended up being such an unrelated thing to the main plot of the game that it reall made me hate it so I'm personally glad they don't seem like they will get much emphasis in the manga)
Well, Aubrey just healed it off in the game because its a video game and in the manga it wouldve been kinda strange for her to have just whipped out a healing thing and continued to fight XD also wasnt Basil originally with Kim and not Aubrey? I dont think Aubrey even did much to Basil in the first encounter, though i havent played in a while so i might be wrong. The dream world segments drag on because Sunny is sleeping, and also I think the more you spend time in the dream world leads to a specific ending (?). Also fighting the phobias are something to symbolize facing your fears and ''you can do it, everything is okay" sort of mindset. All in all i think the manga is okay but it was too fast paced to really get much of any intel and it did misunderstand Aubrey a little.
I don't think it misunderstood Aubrey at all, we just have the first chapter and she's an angry hateful kid with a baseball bat, of fucking course she gets more deep than that later but at the beginning of the game she acts as an antagonist. Although, if they leave Aubrey as is for the entire manga I would agree. This is just one side of her and we should see more later, maybe even more material talking about the fact she was stabbed? Maybe some bandaging or something idk? I get it's a game but it is still a real weird thing in the plot, I would say one of my biggest two issues.. . . The other biggest issue being (im great at segways I know) the three phobias because while I think they work in concept I think the execution fucked them. I get that it's a representation of getting over trauma and learning healthy ways of dealing with them, I get in the Hikkikomori route they work as a way to show Sunny's repressed feelings, but the pay off to it just being Oh yeah, Sunny got scared by a spider and fell into a lake made me just hate them.. . Are you telling me, that getting scared by a spider and falling into a lake generated as much trauma for Sunny as the truth?  The phobias just have too much emphasis for such a cheap pay off, the reason for the phobias should have been related to the truth in someway, or they should have had a lesser emphasis on the story because... for the first two days? That's a major piece of the puzzle! Two of like the 4 or 5 sections of lore you got were phobia sequences, and you are telling me they amount to an anecdote that has almost no relevance to the game besides sharing a theme?. . . As for the dreamworld draggin on because it's a dream, yeah I know that's the point, but that still doesn't make it fun. Like... yeah, it's a great interpretation of escapism through dreams to dodge real life responsabilities, but it's fucking boring. I will admit this isn't fixed as easily as the phobias, since this is one probably the game's greatest interpretations of a mental issue and I wouldn't want to ruin it. It's a great way to show escapism when even you are getting bored of the dream sections, it shows how much Sunny is willing to bury everything. How much he is trying to run away, to push away, and I don't think that feeling would have been conveyed so well if not for the annoyingness of the dream.. . . Going back to Basil and Aubrey... yeah you are correct. At the start of the game he gets bullied by Kim, then shoved(by Kim again) when trying to talk to Aubrey, but from the manga I feel they are cutting the hoolingans of the story so the change works. I do still think it is a shame really, I feel like the hoolingans really show the human side of Aubrey and I really appreciated them as characters but I guess they didn't wanna do the whole chase thing finding out where Aubrey was. We'll see.. . . Lastly my conclusion would be that they DO rush through the story a bit too much for my taste, but most changes are actually pretty good in some way or another. It is a shame to lose some aspects like the hoolingas or the phobias (since I think they could have just fixed some issues and kept them in) but as long as we get some other new things to compensate I won't mind. I think the manga is great so far! I really liked it. . . . . . . . . Except for that Basil panel. You know which one, fuck that, fuck that Basil panel why does he look like that why are his eyes like that
I agree, it definitely feels like they are cutting out the hooligans and phobias almost entirely. The hooligans play a big part in Aubrey's coping with the incident and if the manga cuts them out we'll miss some of Aubrey's more 'human' side.. . . Maybe falling into a lake because of a spider could possibly generate some trauma, especially because Sunny isn't great at swimming, but idk. . . Also I couldn't have described the dream world better :). . . I'm willing to see where the manga goes! And especially because chapter 1 was so fast paced, maybe it will slow down a bit later. I think it has potential!. . . Okay but you have to admit that Basil panel was kinda funny
No, there's no specific ending if you stay longer. You just farm more lol
Ohh okay sorry, I thought it had something to do with the bad ending my bad ':D
No, that's when >!you choose to not continue after OMORI beats your ass in the fight!<
Ohh tysm!
Np
The only "mischaracterizing" i noticed was that aubrey was more openly antagonistic instead of just talking shit tbh
yeah most of the characters stayed faithful to what they were in the game (even if the artstyle was kinda not accurate and there were only like 6 characters)
Jesus fucking Christ 
My fucking god
>!it still didn't make me like her though, but poor overly-aggressive egoistic girl.!<
I feel even worse for Aubrey now

GO ON BLIZTWING!!!
I'M GONNA FEED HER HER OWN HEART
: That's it, Mom. This is MY house now.. . 
I mean… her head is perfectly in place for a good swing. Kinda like a golf putt or one of those tall stands you can put balls on (no idea what they’re called). . (I do not advice use of a baseball bat to harm people, this is simply an observation)
As if i didn't have enough reasons to relate to Aubry 
I actually thought the same, not to be weird. I always understood her anger, as I used to have the same issue. Not that it’s a good thing, but I understand how hard it is to admit when you’re wrong and try to work through the anger rather than let it charge you. Then the lines in this. It’s so sad. It really hurts when your home doesn’t feel like a home anymore. It’s a feeling that’s hard to understand until you’ve been there.
holy shot THANK you, finally someone who doesn't mischaracterize her. I feel like she is the type of a character that gets hardly sympathized with if you don't understand her struggles trough your own perspective, at least that's what i get from the fandom. Also, damn man, guess we got issues...
It’s always refreshing to see someone else who feels the same! And yes I suppose so! This is so weird, I forgot I had posted this, and the reason I got kicked up ordered to go at the restaurant I work at. It’s been years since I’ve seen this lady! So odd. Anyways, yes. Being angry and taking it out on others isn’t a good thing, but people with these issues understand that. It’s more of a matter of not knowing how to work through it, dealing with incredibly difficult emotions, and of course admitting you are having an effect on others. It’s very painful! It took a lot out of me personally to come to terms with how I had been acting, even if it felt justified. This is absolutely Aubrey. You can see when she feels remorse and the manga actually does a good job of showing that. It becomes You VS The World and you get this inner hatred that’s more directed at yourself than others.. . That isn’t an easy feeling to have though, and when you feel people have abandoned you, it only amplifies and validates this anger. Because deep inside, you feel and know you’re pushing people away and wonder why they weren’t there to begin with. Just like your parents. It really makes you feel like people genuinely do not care and it’s crazy how real this thought can feel. . . Sorry for the long rant! I feel like people get her so wrong. Explaining her actions isn’t saying she wasn’t in the wrong, it’s just understanding how she came to feel that way and having some empathy
Hey, you okay?
Let's say Hero and Aubrey helped me to relize i have issues and fastforward now, i have a therapistc so yeah, thanks!
Well that’s great to hear. I hope things turn around for the better more going forward
Yesss they absolutely did. It was a tough journey. Also happy cake day! Very cool pfp btw, i love hollow knight
Glad to hear you’re doing better! Thank you so much! Great taste in games btw
HAPPY CAKEDAY 🎂
Thanks!
Man
Well damn, major tone shift from the indifference in the game.
Where's this from? I don't remember this
Alright, she’s going on the confront characters list. . 
Aubrey’s mom’s gonna yearn for the mines with this one
I hate her
It feels a bit on the nose and edgy, but still what the fuck 
WOW.
holy shit
. . Holy moly
Damn. That was so freaking hard to read
This genuinely makes Aubrey much more understandable, considering we haven’t seen before her home life that reflects on how shitty she is. . . If I rlly got to understand her more I’d like her more
hot take: i think it is poorly made. aubreys mom in the game seemed like totally out of it and that made the whole situation feel much worse. here it is just worded like a 3rd grader: "a reminder that i dont care about you"
it seems just fine? a good way to show how bad their relationship is
(Insert joke about how Aubrey's mom would be a perfect partner for Marty Armstrong from the Lisa games because they're both awful)
How I hate Aubrey mom so much I wish I can adopt Aubrey
Are you sure this is a good idea? You know Aubrey is hostile.
DAMN OK WTF
I don't condone murder . . But
good god

She just like my mom fr
Without differences?
why did she say this
Finally the comic is helping us make some things that are unclear clearer
I guess Aubrey's mom is third on my fictional characters hitlist
Who is the second and first?
Valentino from Hazbin Hotel and Mafuyu's mom from PJSK
Aubrey and her mother, lived alone in a small house
dw guys in the good ending Polly adopted Aubrey and Basil so they became siblings and they all lived happyly after  (omocat is my classmate and she told me this believe me)
Auby, hand me the bat.
This is why Aubrey has abandonment issues and thought her friends abandoned her too, like her mother.
Oh.
Wait...chapter 11 is out?
Same reaction fr i just can't find it
this is so hecking true

hey could you send me the chapter? for analysis reasons… heh..
@TheSlyGuy5 on twitter posted it
i checked and couldnt find the post
Look up Omori in weebcentral .com, they have the chapter
Smash
If only real Aubrey was this charming
Watch your mouth!!
I think he needs his patella gone
I mean manga Aubrey
Real Aubrey IS that charming!!!!!
Bro is probably a gross colour
YOU'RE A GROSS COLO-
[ Removed by Reddit ]
Bro literally stabbed Aubrey with a steak knife without hesitation, of course
Also there was real world Aubrey with peak poses, did you not finish the chapter? 
Aubrey's hair is especially illustrated magnificiently!
I’m mainly just happy to have new official omori content. The pacing has been off for some of it, I will admit. But I’ve been enjoying is so far. . . My one and only complaint is from the most recent chapter, here, Aubrey throws out the album before the confrontation at the church, while in the game she throws it out after. This just makes Aubrey’s line of “I’m protecting it” seem very hypocritical.
I think it’s alright, but I think a sped-up version of the original sequence of events would have worked okay too.     . The artstyle is… questionable. Overall it looks neat, but it really wasn’t the best artist they could pick-and there were a couple minor mistakes too.      . And then there’s Aubrey, whose personality seems to have been amplified from the game. Not sure if that was necessary.
The mischaracterization of Aubrey, at least in chapter 1, infuriated me to no end
aubrey wearing bow? bow from inanimate insanity? inanimate insanity reference?
🪑
Right?? I really liked it as well, the parallels between Aubrey and her real counterpart was peak
The idea of the mind-control device was cool too.
This style reminds me of "A Silent Voice" and/or "Takopi." Especially Aubrey looks like Naoka/Shizuka.
As the strongest kid Sunny fought the fraud Aubrey he began to pull out his knife. Aubrey shrunk back in fear saying "Holy sh** is that a knife?" and then Sunny said stand proud Aubrey you're strong.
Aubrey is finally a part of the bocchiverse
AUBREY'S (CANON?) VOICE IS SO GOOD!
THE VIDEO IS SO BEAUTIFUL YET SO FUCKING SAD I HATE SEEING AUBREY SAD SO MUCH 
. . *\*Aubrey seeing this scene and rating it 143/10:\**
Aubrey looking excited is probably same as young aubrey looking like
She gets excited everytime she sees omori
Her real young self like real aubrey before the incident
I see a lot of people thinking that kel just bottled up his emotions, but that isn’t really the case, he just worked through his trauma by helping hero work through his. Kel is just a good kid with the correct mindset to work through personal issues, but that kinda drove a wedge between him and Aubrey because he couldn’t understand why Aubrey was acting so miserably and Aubrey couldn’t understand how he was just fine.
I think it’s a mix of both him being more accepting as well as bottling them in
AUBREY HOLY SHTI OH YM GOD
Aubrey looks awesome in a suit
Aubrey looks so good in a suit omg
oh wow that was bigger than I expected holy Aubrey jumpscare 😭
a very good jumpscare to get 🫶🫶
Not wrong not wrong 🙂‍↕️
Basil chuckled as she planted a kiss on his cheek, "Thanks Aubrey...". . Mari stared at them, unsure of how to feel.. . It's good... They're happy... Even after.... . But, Sunny... She remembered how Sunny always blushed looking at Aubrey. Always asked Basil to see the photos he took of her.. . This isn't right.. . Aubrey scrambled to explain, stumbled over her words.. . Mari didn't respond. **Couldn't** respond.. . Aubrey looked down.. . "O-Oh! Right!" She changed the topic, flipping open the photo album, "Let's look at our Memory Album together!"
I could almost HEAR the *shlink* when the knife tore into Aubrey. Also there was a significant lack of the hooligans, wonder if they’re gonna show up, to be fair they aren’t super important to the story but they are fun characters
. . Okay, but this was pretty damn cool too.
The UK
Bro pulled a knife into a sword fight
She immediately got her ass handed to her  
At this point you'll be Able to just get the entire thing on this sub by combining together all the posts lol
Now go tell me that it wasnt self defence
I can't take her seriously at all though. The art is really good, but as a consequence the characters look really young. Aubrey looks like her 12 year old self in a different outfit here, and it's more adorable than intimidating.
The second chapter is a big improvement in terms of pacing, it doesn't feel like it's going from plot point to plot point, and the little bits of story that DO happen are really significant. >!I like the short scene of Aubrey looking at the photos before throwing it away, it's really nice.!<
Nah, I'd ball. *repeatedly throws basketball on Aubrey's face*
Lore accurate
. . Neat cosplay, honestly. This is on par to that gal I called the IRL Aubrey on another account-
woah!! looks just like the real! I’d think I were hallucinating if I saw you lmao
just reminded me how easy it is to cosplay as headspace aubrey. . very good job on the cosplay 
Fantastic! 
Nice, now find a hospital with someone that got >! Stabbed in the eye!< in the top level for a really funny prank
AUBY!!!!!! 
Phase  Complete. . Phase  TBD
When you put them side by side you can really see that 16y/o Auby has really embraced her inner gremlin
OMG IT'S SO CUTE!!t5\31hpy:2028
Now bully a twink.
This looks so good!!! Great job!
Awesome cosplay!
Holy shit auby irl

kind want to do this 
. . Hell yeah
i-is that... Au-Aubrey from the h-hit 2020 indie psychological horror rpg "OMORI"
At the time of me writing this comment, no one like or dislike. It's at 143.
Looks exactly like the character
awww, you look so cute!!. .   . you look just like her when she was younger \^\^
. . "Hm..She looks cool."
Now you need a mr eggplant plushie to hug and/or a baseball bat to violently smash anything in front of you to bits
Wow, you look great and really suit the character! Well done!
Really amazing look and really pretty
U LOOK SO CUTE!!
LOOKS SO COOL!!! 🙌🙌
Wow!!!

HOLY SHIT DW AUBREY ESCAPED INTO THE REAL WORLD
You actually look the part! Good job, 10/10 (just dont simp for black and white boys)
Or go to an empty school hallway with said black and white boy 
I love this shade of purple
Hey, one of your friends is dead and everyone left you behind, now take this *gives her a crop top, pink hair dyer, a cool jacket, a jean skirt and a softball bat with nails* have fun beating the shit out of the blonde twink!
where are my teal contacts, I can't do it without my teal contacts >:c
*throws the teal contacts at her* NOW DO IT!!!
Yooo nice cosplay!

aubergin
As a cosplayer myself, I loved seeing this so much. . You made an excellent work, so keep up with it.
AH IT'S SO CUTE WONDERFUL JOB!

AWWWWWWW THIS IS SO GOOD
This is adorable! You did an awesome job!
You look amazing! <3 
 Adorable (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)
Cool!
Fantastic cosplay! I now have the perfect image of what baby Auby would look like 🩷🩷. . Also off-topic, but I really like your room! I’ve always wanted to be able to paint my bedroom walls but my parents are renters, so I never got to 🫠
Cutie patootie 👍🏻👍🏻
I\`m guessing you meant AUBREY used her bat and not OMORI?
I mean sweetheart is metamorphical representation of aubrey
Aubrey’s gonna fucking *die*
Aubrey will drop the "fight me" attitude prematurely
😭 i was Aubrey as a teen at Comic Con. wish I saw you guys!
My first reaction before seeing the other images was “that’s a weird Aubrey”
same lmao
Maybe.... >!it was Aubrey who fell in the stair !!<
There's Something going on
There's something happening here
Something is behind you 

You both look super cute in your cosplays

2nd image is staring right into my soul... Judging my every action, my every mistake
ARGH NOT FAIR AJBDJDBEIQJBDOWKSNFBWKNS
You ain't gonna get Aubrey with that cut sun man
True 
My gf saw Aubrey at the train station (she was dressed as Sailor Moon 🤭) might have been the same person, as there were not a lot of Omori characters she told.
Cool!!
Berdly . . btw ur cosplay(and Aubrey) IS SO DAMN CUTE
Thank you!
Amazing pictures! You even met an Auby!
That rabbits’ cosplay of Aubrey’s bunny is immaculate
They should get an Award for that
A cosplay with Aubrey holding a bunny wasn't something I thought I needed. I love it
aww thank u 
Woah… Aubrey irl?! . . . . Just kidding really cool cosplay! 
where does everyone get the headband and jacket aaaa i want them so bad
sales of white jackets with gold or orange collars skyrocketing after 2020:
lmfao
I got mine from speedycosplay.com!! i kinda had to pester the seller a bit because it had been weeks before I heard back, but when I did it arrived really fast :) the headband I just searched wire headbands on amazon hehe
Great cosplay

Yeah cool but... WHERE'S ALBAHACA
it would be nice to cosplay as aubrey but i look like a boy
Awww don’t let that stop you, I do too without makeup on :)
it's just i feel really big and i'm really hairy and i don't even know how to do makeup and my brain can barely admit i want to do this
Aubby real
Your cosplay looks awesome!
thank you!!
: Tell me Aubrey, do I feel lucky?. . : Well do you, PUNK?
The alternate universe where sunny had a gun and shot Aubrey to death instead of stabbing her in the Aubrey fight
DUUUDE that Aubrey cosplay is on point. Did anyone ask you to take a picture with them? I love when people go to these special events dressed up as one of the characters. Auby would be proud 
Omg thank you 😭😭 this was a very casual cosplay (too tired to bother with the color contacts this morning) so I’m glad some people like it  I actually had the bat too, but changed my mind bc I realized maybe I shouldn’t bring that into a shop 
What do you mean? . You should carry the murder weapon with you at ALL TIMES 
“Aubrey’s! We have the bats!!”
You look exactly like how i imagine aubrey to look like irl 10/10 cosplay
Omg thank you this is the best compliment ever  it’s my actual hair so I think that helps 
I'm sure you'd pull off Aubrey even without the hair! I don't plan on changing my hair too
Incredible !!! You're the best !❤❤🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Aubrey's watching you
Hehe thanks 😎😎❤❤
Nah it's a good cosplay I was just parodying some comments on another post like this except with Aubrey
Whatcha doing here ?? Aubrey is waiting for a basketball match  
Very accurate
Omg, so pretty 
Thanks!!! 
If there ever is an omori movie, you need to be aubrey
Aubrey if she was a Cyberpunk npc
You look how I see aubrey in my head. Like your face really fits her
Ur so pretty woa (great cosplay btw :D)
awww thank you!!! :)
THIS SI SO COOL!!! LOOKS GREAT! 
Thank you so much!!! 
your so pretty! fantastic cosplay
I LOVE IT!!! RW Aubrey is my fav character other than Headspace Aubrey and RW Basil :D
I loved it!!! It’s really well for a cosplay made just by things you already had at home, also you totally killed it with the posing! (Arrasou conterrânea😊!!!)
Valeu maninho!!! Fico feliz que curtiu :))
you are literally Auby irl 
I don’t think I can say what I’m thinking right now. . You’re very pretty btw
Yk what i love about these types of cosplays? When the cosplayer doesnt dump a ton of correction makeup on their face so the charecter looks flawless and not real. This gotta be my favorite Aubrey cosplay ever, good job
Omg thank you so much!!! I appreciate it!!
it beautiful tbh
When an Aubrey cosplayer smile while being in cosplay, they have my soul. . 
awww your too kind, thanks!!t5\31hpy:2028
Omori Live action!???
This is amazing!!!

really??? thank you so much !!t5\31hpy:2028
This is amazing is an solid 87/100
thank you so much!! what do you think I could improve next? I'm really new to cosplay and makeup in general lol
Facial expresións and makeup to aproach your face to the character . . The clothes are 10 of 10 . . . The safety and comfort of one with the character is also important when taking photos, it makes a lot of difference. I don't know how to explain it... It is felt when a person is confident and their whole body and expressions convey it (maybe you can relate it to getting into the role). also do not abuse post-production and learn more about photography and lights in order to achieve more optimal results.
did she move to the city too?
I love it ❤️
Live Auby reaction: 


that would be funny to cosplay as couple but not knowing eachother irl
The aubies
sunni & arbys
You marry she?
Now kiss. . 
Yeah, they should kiss. . 
Nice
U two went on a date?
no
This was your chance. Hope you didn't fumble.
thats cute have this. . . . and no I’m not casting the spell just take it
find her again and kiss her sweetly on the lips right fucking now
"hey ma'am you ever been arrested before?". . : yeah, how could you tell. . "i was gonna say it's illegal to be that cute but now im curious". . : aggravated assault
god forbid women do anything 🙄
:2467:
: Also arson
HELP
this is staged btw!! asked the police if its okay to take this kind of pic and they agreed
And here I was thinking she was being arrested for real
Cosplayers asking an officer to fake an arrest with them is [such a funny and niche subgenre of photo & I love it](). Props for contributing to the collection.
omg thank you?? 😭😭💖💖
Was about to ask what you did.
jaywalking
🙀
Me if intimidating people with a spike bat was illegal
real . . (also nice job lmao)

auby in Philippines
"You call this putting up a fight?! We call this a difficulty tweak". . -Police arresting Aubrey
Aubrey is probably used to this
this happens on a daily basis
This is what you get for carrying around a nail-studded baseball bat without a licence or any other identifiable permit.
LOL
Cool cosplay man!
thank you!!!
You’re welcome!
strong legs.. . also where did your spiky bat go
they confiscated it... (actually my friend held it for me)
whyd they confiscate it (ah i see so it wouldn't get in the way of the picture)
because they arrested aubers
shoes are 🔥

ALRIGHT. So, I bought a plain orange basket shirt, got some white fabric and stitched it, IF YOU END UP MAKING AN AUBREY COSPLAY AND USING THE JACKET PLZ @ ME. . I'm so sorry, the Orange Joe is already in my belly! So have some mercy if I end up farting. . And, uhhhhh, I accidentally ate the dollar so, uhhhh, ask Aubrey to wait! 
oo alright im not the best at stitching, i havent done it in years and i really dont want to mess up the jacket if i try lmao, it wont be immediately for the cosplay as i said im not the best as stitching, but to be fair i am gonna try to get my hair dyed pink sooner or later, so if i do cosplay, itll have to be without the jacket (unless i somehow convince omo to make the aubrey jacket and sell it on the website theirself), and my memories not the best so once i get the chance to do aubrey's cosplay you might not get @ because of my poor memory  but hopefully you wind up to see the post because ill 100% post it here  . . kel wtf that orange joe is 5 years old  why would you drink all of it if you knew it was 5 years old . . youre never gonna give aubrey back her dollar arent you  ill just have to fish the dollar from your wardrobe instead 
Oh thanks. I was gonna ask how you did the shirt.




. . (awesome cosplay!)
I love the shoes! And the whole cosplay looks great!
Thank you!! Tried to match her canon shoes as closely as possible 🫶
You did great! Inspiring me to give a try at an Aubrey cosplay, she's one of my favorite characters in the game. Just gotta add her to the queue lol

Gus 👍
Best cosplay I've seen in a long time
This is so kind!! Thank you so much!!
Damn, well thought of camera angles.
Aubrey got real lol. . (Also Amazing cosplay)
Great cosplay! How did you make the nails on the bat? They look really good!
They’re silicone mount screws for a PC, covered in a thin layer of hot glue and spray painted! They’re squishy and bendable, so totally safe to bring to a con :)
Wonderful cosplay!
That’s so cool
OMG THIS COSPLAY LOOKS AMAZING 
Auby is real
This is such a compliment I’m 🫣
They made Auby OMORI for real! 😯
Approved
👍🏻
Cool
Aaaa!!! Me and a bunch of my friends are going as the Headspace gang for Akon!!. . Also, wonderful cosplay!!! 
this is soo cool!!! im curious tho, where'd you get the jacket? ive been looking ALL OVER for a jacket like hers in-game but i haven't been able to find anything 
I made it! I kind of made it- I bought a plain cropped white jacket from Shein and then added all the yellow myself!
wooahhh you did a great job on it then!! it looks perfect! 

truly a  moment
this is amazing


aub


Gnarly as heck. Shoes really stand out, in a good way that is. Delightful attention to detail.
Pretty convenient how you’re sitting next to plants
great job!
I never new we could send Omori cosplays here! Also, Amazing cosplay Aubrey!!
Auby moment
How the hell are you that tall??? Nah man Aubrey would be intimidated by you, on a side note that’s a pretty cool cosplay!
I think it might be the shorts making me appear taller 😅 I'm actually 5'8'' so although a little taller than Sunny in game, still shorter than Aubrey. That is if you're using this scale chart: [
Huh, you definitely look taller in the pictures.. . . I think the mirror is making it seem that way. . . Still, cosplay looks great!
AUBREY what the fu-
rw aubrey is a total banger
A friend of mine told me that dark skinned tonned people could rock any outfit. He was completely right, your Aubrey cosplay looks really good!
Thank you so much that's so nice🥰💕✨
OP has cosplayed as aubrey multiple times and nothing happened back then I'm sure it'll be fine 
Back at it with another amazing Aubrey cosplay! 
Poc Aubrey supremacy
It looks so pretty! Literally how I'd imagine Aubrey in real life 
Thank youuuu <33
Wow amazing job! One of the best cosplays I’ve seen 
You were literally born to cosplay Aubrey.. . Edit: are there nails in the bat?
Thank youu!! Unfortunately there are no nails on the bat, going out in a public park with that would have gotten me in trouble probably 😭😭😭
Honestly fair enough 😂
Yesssss that looks amazing 💖
APPROVED. Amazing cosplay btw
Wow you even have her blue eyes are those contacts like hers or just natural?
I have blue eyes! Makes her a lot easier to cosplay
It's looks very good! 👍👍
I know Aubrey when I see Aubrey. And THAT’S Aubrey. 👌
Wait it’s not the real Aubrey 😆? It looks amazing !!! You look exactly like her ! You’re so pretty !
W
Let’s go we have a racist cosplay “you’re a gross color Kel”-Aubrey When her racist genes took control. But NGL the cosplay looks exactly how i would imagine aubrey in RL
Who took her out of my game? How do I put her back in the archives? I dont wanna have my progress all for nothing cause Aubrey decided to take a walk outside :C
That's an awesome cosplay owo
Now you need an Aubrey to accidentally injure
I’ve been tirelessly trying to convince one of my little brothers to cosplay Aubrey, not much luck yet 
No just find a random girl named Aubrey and slash her.
Nah that’s such a good idea, legit about to start running up to every woman I see like a psycho until I find an Aubrey 
Gamescome in cologne, I was there myself and met a cute Aubrey cosplayer
Where? I was on the lookout for other Omori Characters all the time but never saw anyone.
I just saw them walking through the halls and asked them for a picture, so no specific place to look out for.
Wow all of you did a great job on your costumes! This is rly cute 🥰
Thank you 🥰🥰🥰
Hey Aubrey! You have beautiful eyes wow
Thank you !❤❤
Lol imagine having friends hahaha *sobs*
Oh come on don't say such things🥰❤

aww i love this lmao . . &#x200B;. . also you all look wonderful \^\^
Thank youu❤❤❤
This is beautiful
👍
Why does  look so done in the selfie lmao. . Also why can't I be this confident and finally do a cosplay :'(
Yeah he was definitely done😂😂 And don't worry, I used to be really shy before I began cosplaying but then I realized how amazing it was when people started complimenting my first cosplay and I found friends with whom I share the same passions and overall it's so great ! You'll never regret cosplaying :3
They All look so creepy wtf
Oh man that's awesome . . hope you had fun
Cool cosplay! . And is that Heavy weaponsguy behind you?
i think so
Holy shit its that Heavy from tf2 behind Aubrey from Omori
"I am Heavy Weapons Guy, and **this**, is my weapon."
I feel like they might get along if they met.
The kind of weird badass uncle and badass rude Girl relationship(platonic btw)
I like character dynamics like that.  Platonic character relationships are really underrated.
That's actually really cool!
Nicely done cosplay =)
Jealousy is my sin.
how’d y do the jacket!?
AAA HOLY SHITTTT THIS IS SO PEAK MY EYES ARE WITNESSING PEAK I ADORE THIS COSPLAY
Smoll Aubrey 
auby plushie 
No bat? Cringe.. . /j is very good
nice‼️‼️ now you need a blond gay boy to bully for 4 years
Auby  (why do we only have one auby emoji)
We have 
Yeah but only one RW aub which is who OP cosplayed
🤯 Real ‼️
you literally are aubrey
I LOVE ITT 🤩
Amazing cosplay!
👍
 very cool
cool!!
Nicee
You are the reason Aubrey!! 
Yayyy auby
cute
hey my comment is on the shirt
no. . . . downvoted
Auby: *turns into a bunny mane/fur, which then flies away when wind blows*
So this isn't really a theory as much as an observation, but it's a fun detail I thought people might appreciate:. . In Headspace, stairs are only ever seen when something scary is happening, for obvious reasons. Vertical movement during the not scary parts of Headspace is done with ladders.. . When you visit Aubrey in her house, you access her room by ladder. Despite the uncomfortable context surrounding the visit and despite how much Aubrey has changed, Sunny isn't afraid of her.
You leave neighbors house by stairs and that's not scary
That's an xylophone.. . Technically.
the first thing that happens after coming to headspace and meeting your friends is taking the stairs up to the forest. stretch-o-lymopics
Considering Aubrey and Sunny spent a lot of 1 on 1 time on the swings where Aubrey talked to him, I wouldn't be surprised if Aubrey's hectic home life was a big source of their discussions.. . And if she trusted him with this info, I wouldn't be surprised if Aubrey was ok with inviting Sunny over to her place where he probably saw for himself how bad her home life was.. . Sunny basically knows the intimate details for almost all the members of the friend group.
He also knew about Aubrey having a pet thanks to the bunny killer quest where mari comments that Aubrey wouldn't like that you agreed to it hinting towards the fact that Aubrey has a pet bunny
hi omori-.. (gasp) Is that a friend of yours?!! Hello!! I'm Aubrey.
IT'S A TRAP! FALL BACK, FALL BACK!
there are probably roaches and rats living in Aubrey's bed
Or maybe Aubrey just makes it painfully obvious that she really likes the colour pink
Does she make it painfully obvious on what her headboard/ bed looks like? 🧐
Eww pink is gross
If OP's theory is to be believed Otherworld in general and Aubrey's house have a ton of connections; it seems to be something of a conglomeration of various areas of the plaza and Aubrey's house.. . They both involve climbing a ladder to get there, and exist in the same place next to a dump. Various otherworld locations seem to take inspiration from items in Aubrey's room, such as her old antenna TV and her Spaceboy poster which has a location in Otherworld based entirely around it, color scheme and all. Junkyard's centerpiece is, out of all things, a couch. Also worth noting that the entire area is excessively pink and Aubrey is the only one who comments on hating trash when going into Junkyard, hating the smell, and just wanting to get out.. . This along with reusing Aubrey's specific bed sprite instead of the multitude of other pre-made ones in Neighbor's Bedroom as well as Sunny's knowledge of various things in Aubrey's room such as the name of her pet and oddly enough her use for buckets definitely seem to imply something. Or I'm reading too into things... but it's fun to speculate
“Otherworld” is basically othermart right? . . Why do you think the junkyard is Aubreys house besides the multitude of trash
Its all a giant reference to the recycalists
A little off topic. . . Remember the leader, he was the kid who couldn’t buy a lamp? What actually happened to that kid? Like fr his mom just let her clearly deranged son run off into the night….is he dead?…….he’s probably dead
I've always seen Aubrey as the most open minded person in the group so she could
I have the same Birthday as Aubrey also
fuck I'm jealousy
Be fr, Basil could never survive the south of France the sun would end him instantly.  Down here people are tough, loud, and proud we don’t get scared by girls like Aubrey, like we are the Aubrey
Babe wake up new Omori AU just dropped. . Oaubrey
Obobrey
Shikikomori lmao
[Her?]()
Image isn't loading but the joke was that the anime character from that anime looks like aubrey and shikomori or whatever it's called is similar to hikikomori lmao
The image was of Shikimori actually 
[Aubrey In Wonderland]()
Maybe, although given how much literal death/near-death Aubrey's been exposed to, from both sides, the photos are probably an amusing anecdote by comparison.
I can kinda agree but the photos are what basically lead her to bullying him for a bit so i can see it affecting her a little
True, but I was gonna add that comparative lack of consequences about the photos (Aubrey was able to undo the damage and clean them up) versus whatever role the bullying played in Basil attempting suicide probably makes it a little more one-sided than the accident that killed Mari and the subsequent coverup.
Yeah that is true
The thing with Aubrey is shes very emotional idk if shed be quick to be like "oh im the same way". Plus if she found out about the photos too. Idk but i dont think itll take long
Yeah that's true, I just like happy endings
Tbf i think ultimatepy she forgives him so it is a happy ending
she deserves a happy ending 
Yeah
Aubrey feels guilty for doing the same thing as Sunny and bullying Basil. She apologized 3 times. Of course she would forgive fast, otherwise her development and redemption would be pointless.. . Please don't listen to that Aubrey hater.
WEll they were REALLY good friends but its true that kel annoyed aubrey every once in a while you can see this from aubreys dialouge in the rral world where they found her kel says that she looked wery cutr when they were children and then aubrey says: you thougth i was cute oh is that why you aleays picked on me when we were kids and then kel ssys what i never picked on you then aubreys says sure... i mean i think imma trust aubrey couse kel probably saw this as funny thing and didnt think it was picking on her
Even in the tags they are shown to be bickering but in the actually photos you can see they're just friends, Like they probably got along a lot better in the real world. ( just look at the first photo and I can't imagine dream Aubrey and kel doing that) . . I've got a few explanations as to why . . 1) headspace is an exaggeration of Sunny's childhood. So that's why even the fights are exaggerated, ( same applies to the blatant Heromari flirting, ) . . 2) Sunny projected his crush onto dream Aubrey that's why dream Aubrey loves omori so much, Maybe Sunny got jealous that Kel was closer to Aubrey even if they fought ( even in photos we get multiple moments where Kel and Aubrey and close while Sunny watches from a distance) , that's why he projected that too. . . 3) I'm reading too much into this.
I also noticed H!Aubrey's crush on Omori is way more blatant once Sunny sees Aubrey in the real world.
Maybe he's trying to push away from the reality of who Aubrey is now? But the same thing happens in the hikikomori route...
> I’m reading too much into this. . Welcome to r/OMORI
Ok I need a bit of help on this, did they actually fight that much in the dream world?. . Maybe I just forgor some of those moments, but the only actual 'fight' I could think of is when Kel takes her stuffed toy at the beginning of the game.. . Especially since Aubrey is an only child, and their friend group has 2 pairs of siblings, Aubrey and Kel sometimes just act like a brother and sister would.
Well, It feels like they only argue because headspace ommitted the good moments shown in the album
I get that, but I think I just tuned out when they argue because I thought they got along really well in Headspace
2nd point seems pretty correct imo lol Omori is actually such a fucked game
Back when I first started the game, I thought that Aubrey and Kel fought like those kids who have crushes on eachother and can only express it by throwing rocks at eachother lmao. . Of course, this is also before I realized Aubrey was crushing on Sunny, so...
Dudeeee same.
>Back when I first started the game, I thought that Aubrey and Kel fought like those kids who have crushes on eachother and can only express it by throwing rocks at eachother lmao. . So i agree that she totally had a thing for him, but i can only think in broad strokes, what specifics are there?
aubrey isn't implied to reciprocate the crush, only sunny is confirmed to have a crush on her
I probably shud have clarified that it was specifically in the headspace segments I had these thoughts about, lol
We should build a great wall to avoid all of the gross colors from getting to our PINK nation   . \-Aubrey Trump
This is probably why he likes Aubrey cuz she’s just as racist as him
i guess he took aubrey's comment too serious
Why is Aubrey’s arm thinner than a toothpick 0-0
Merg is that you?

Yeah, they don't like those comment chains... (what did I cause??)
Monika would be proud
“-brush your damn teeth for once? I can smell your breath from here.”. . >!In all seriousness, I think that she would’ve said something like “keep in touch”, considering that Sunny is moving in one day, and Aubrey probably doesn’t want to lose another one of her friends.!<
> “-brush your damn teeth for once? I can smell your breath from here.”. . YEAH FR LIKE WHY ONLY 6% OF PEOPLE HAVE "Minty Fresh" achievement on Steam?
I've played the game about 9 times and every time, without fail, I forget to brush my teeth on the past day because I'm like "oo hoo hoo time for the good part"
Me every evening/night in RW: Ok can I brush my teeth at the evening/night? Oh yeah, I can't, ok.. . Me every morning in RW: OK NOW I HAVE TO CHECK IF I MAY BRUSH MY TEETH, YAY I CAN.. . (I genuinely had no idea brushing teeth was an achivement)
It's an odd one and it's one of like. 5 achievements I'm missing because I just keep forgetting lmao
pls tell me one of achievements you miss is "Too slow!" 
You can? How?!
You may brush your teeth anyday interacting with mom's note about brushing teeth in bathroom each morning
Personally i didn't even know it was an option
He has bad breath?
“-kill yourself ”
:no and that's why your father left you

"You should kill yourself... NOW!". . *

omg merg
“Keep in touch”, maybe? . . Also, a bit unrelated, but do you watch Merg or did you just decide to name him Maxy?
None, I was watching a completely random video and only took screenshot
On a more serious note, while "Keep in touch with us" makes the most sense, she already said that in the swings (IIRC).. . It probably was a bit more deep than that, like 'Keep talking to me" or "We can still be friends once you move" or something along those lones
Merg my beloved
She may wanted him to keep in touch...probably in a more personal manner than just friends which is why she is struggling so hard to say it and why she doesn't want to say it around others.
merg . . (ok but it's probably to stay in touch, like many others suggest)

Wait, then how did you get this image…? How does one get an image from a youtuber and not know who it was-
I found the image in a random video, it wasn't merg
Interesting.
FUCK

Language
Just Aubrey. 
Later in the game she asks if he can visit from time to time.
"kill the dream stans. you have a knife, do it. i'll be watching."
 : Listen can you Crank that Soulja boi

Either to call or come back from time to time.
"Can you shower and brush your teeth?? you stink" 
When I saw this line for the first time I thought she wanted to say "take me with you"
Lol, to many headcanons man
I wish it happened.

MERG MOMENTO 
MOMENTO??!? ESPAÑOL?!??
If I could stay with you so we can learn dark spells like necromancy and revive so when we used to know
”-Visit us sometime?”
Bro merg
"Give me your contact info" etc.
Probably something about calling each other personally and keeping in touch on a more one on one level
>Did we forget about the mocking and the stab,. . Aubrey say sorry for that. stab is optional.
My guess is its just what she's gonna say on the swing set. Some people think she's gonna confess feelings here and in no way does that fit in this context.

Bro is about to bully Sans
Doesn’t she say it after some while ? "would it be trouble for you to come back once in a while?" maybe i’m crazy but i feel like it happens
change colour 
“Buy female transformers like strong arm and wind blade so there can be more representation in Transformers media?”
call at some point ig
I think she was gonna ask if you could bring her with you which I wanted to do badly.
Later In the game, when Kel, Aubrey, Hero, and Sunny are staying the night at Basil’s, Aubrey talks specifically to Sunny saying to “Visit every now and then”, and then hero adds on with a ton of things they could do together while Sunny visits. . I’m pretty sure this conversation was continuing off of when Aubrey got cut off, and what Aubrey was going to say.
visit me/us from time time to time?
Jokes aside you find out before going to bed for the last time
she was probably going to ask if he could visit sometime's
If you could Touch some grass
Stay in touch I guess
merg?!?!
I think in the real world he has the 2nd highest attack with his fist.. . Aubrey has the most attack.. . Even then Hero fights with his fists Aubrey has a metal ass bat.
Aubrey is just wearing a long shirt and panties. Probably because omori is attracted to her.
na it’s like a dressing gown or something. either way they’re both “pyjamas”
. . The proto version of the character is literally just wearing a shirt and panties. The shirt was just sized up.
I did not need to see this
I thought she would be too poor to have proper pjs
Would that have occurred to omori though? They admitted that she didn't used to let them in her house, and he was young the last time he saw her. . . Besides, lots of people sleep in shorts or sweat pants. I don't think "sleeps in just panties" is going to be assumed to be signifying "poor." There's obviously a meta reason which stems from back to the proto versions of the characters where it was more obvious.
auby be like like . . wat. . the. . heck
Bro we’ve had Aubrey’s jacket for ages? This isn’t new??. . 
no this is a completely different thing.  . . The bomber jacket has 20XX, telling us that the real world sequences take place in the 2000s. Along with the portraits information in last resort, we also made an assumption that headspace, or the past, took place in the later 90s. . . Now that we’ve just been told that the recital, aka the past, happened in the 2000s, this completely shatters everyone’s theories, making us have to reconnect the dots entirely.
My Aubrey slipknot head canon can come true
AUBY SIMPS UNITE
I think alcoholism could be a nice hc. It started as a normal liking of wine, beer etc., but having financial problems (asked money to the wrong people and can't give it back) ended up in that situation. . The father still sends money to take care of Aubrey, but it's instead used by the mother for alcohol
Aubrey probally too
Aubrey loves watching sailor moon
The whole cast 100% watched Sailor Moon together as kids.
-Aubrey really likes jazz, more along the lines of [The Villain I Appear to Be](). . -Hero introduced Aubrey to jazz via [Diamond Jack](), and knows how to play the saxophone.. -Kel has, on numerous occasions, tried replacing Aubrey’s drink with homemade Orange Joe, usually getting a slap across the face (or as of New Years, getting knocked out by Aubrey’s bat).. - After the good ending, Sunny started a Twitch streaming account for artwork and gaming. His most frequent commissioner is Basil.. - Mari used to make homemade bento boxes, and actually taught Hero how to do that.
Aubrey is germaphobic. During 12 years, and still is at 16.. . Kim was the leader of the Hooligans before Aubrey joined.. . Sweetheart is Pansexual.
Aubrey falls off her scooter 24/7.
They never find aubreys missing shoe in the final duet
aubrey did professional gymnastics
Aubrey is in eternal pain for some reason
Good note. I didn’t consider much the visual aspect of the lines (in part because there’s nothing to the visual side of the mom’s two quotes).. . Considering we see that the tree was chopped down (and Aubrey puts a pinwheel on the stump so no visual trickery, haha) it’s safe to assume the dad actually did that. So Black Space *can* accurately draw from his memories/knowledge. But at the same time, juxtaposing his quote with that activity - with what emotional and physically-toiling work it must’ve been - just makes the quote stand out even harder.
Just came across this gem of a post! Thanks for sharing your thoughts, because now I can't unsee it for the better. I'm now on the side of "Not knowing" vs "Knowing.". . A minor point to all this is now the "Broken violin." How could his parents not check up with this? And to this, it really is a matter of speculation. Sunny hid it in the Toy Box, and the key was in the Tree house. So It's totally plausible that the parents were like, "we lost the key... can't be helped, let's just leave it in the closet.". . I was always under the impression that Sunny and Aubrey had a mutual crush, but that's also because I kept mixing up dream world and real world memories. 100% confirmed that Sunny liked Aubrey, but as you mentioned, Aubrey really expresses most of her attention on Kel and Mari in the photos. Real world Final night interactions with the two only suggest as far as **care.** Not necessarily romantic affection. If anything, she has a higher likelihood of holding affection towards Hero, whose Tag Images have her blush with their interactions. This however, isn't "technically canon" since, If I recall properly, the only time you can tag in the final night is during the recycultists Daydream sequence, which is a daydream. Even dream Aubrey-Hero Tags have her blush and show immense affection.
We need to cook Aubrey
Remove the comma
*angel
Smh Aubrey has always been a guy you just never noticed
Smh I have been so blind
Nahhh bro Aubrey’s gonna get your ass for doing math(ps never played the game)
shhh..
Aubrey when she has a dream where she is simping for Omori (it is the 15th time this month)
I can actually see that as well lol.
we all know it's aubrey in disguise
Tbf didn't Aubrey have a gang and a nail bat?
Kel didn't know about the knife till fighting Aubrey tho
Can you really blame the depressed kid who hasn't left his house in what was it, 2 years?
She just started and already has an Auby profile pic? Super based
Aubrey is her favorite Omori character and I don’t blame her
Me neither, she was my favorite too like as soon as the game began
holy fuck how does she even guess all that. . &#x200B;. . also, i love the "started playing omori" and she already has an aubrey pfp lmao
The second she saw headspace Aubrey she just said “I want her as my pfp”
I used this parallel in my fic :> I hate when Aubrey is the aggressive one in post ending fanfictions, girl should be mosr understanding person out there
correction about the >!glitched neighboor's place with basil!<.  in any of the routes before the >!church , you can access a bunch of doors in the black space , the distorted neighboor place !<was said to be locked outside save edit but this is not true , if you keep >!visitin the other doors instead of going straight for the black door with the red spotlight , you eventually reach that one normally in the game!<. . On another thing regarding the >!glitched junkyard map in "wet docks" black door:  Is there a way to progress with this? seems that you need aubrey to break stuff and get a key and open a door ,  in the same map hero is inside the teapot and cooks you "key ingredient" which you can then give to some weird character right next to "omoli" in sky docks !<but dont know what to do from there.. . I have seen that any events that you did before cannot be done again which makes me think this is an "hidden quest" , for example >!aubrey's love letter event in the forest makes aubrey in weathervane get distorted , once you get closer to the distorted version a black door appears in to corner of the map , that if you keep entering the doors the game "crashes" but you can still hear the music and makes me think it didnt crash but was made like that on purpose since the previous rooms keep getting darker until it becomes pitch black.!<
But no one else was agressive in Headspace. Kim was the bad influence over them all, including Aubrey. She's the real villain of Omori. I say we burn her, witch hunt style 
I think that Aubrey realises what she’s been doing was wrong and will change and try to change Kim too, and if Kim doesn’t I think Aubrey may leave.
I feel like I’ve seen you comment that somewhere before lol
Being completelly honest, I think she is a very shallow character in canon, at least when it comes to what was presented to us. I believe you can write her however you'd like and it wouldn't be too far from her character.. . In my personal headcanon, Aubrey stops with the bullying >!post truth!<, and she convinces the hooligans to do the same, with varied results. Kim tries to reduce her bullying as much as she can for Aubrey, but old habits die hard
If the fic is already up anywhere could you drop a link? I would love to read it!
Sadness 
How dare you
I'm gonna burn that yee yee ass haircut 
Based af mate
I mean Aubrey straight up says that she has been calling basil names and harassing him, and that “soon I wasn’t the only one doing it”. It definitely wasn’t just Aubrey
Bruh, bullying Basil (even if I hate him) for 4 years isn't something the "weird kids would do". Yeah, they are weird, but also bullies, one thing doesn't mean the other isn't possible too. Plus I really blame them, especially Kim, for Aubrey's change to worse. I always thought that, if those idiots (except Charlene, she was genuinely nice) minded their own business, Aubrey would sooner or later understand what Kel was going through and that he never abandoned her on purpose.. . They would become friends again, then when Kel convinced Hero to come out, the three would become buddies again, even if Hero was away for college. Maybe Kel could convince Aubrey to listen to Basil (since that idiot Kim only encourages violence towards him) and Aubrey would understand he wasn't the one who did you-know-what-to-the-album.. . Then, being 4 out of 5, it would have been easier to convince Sunny to come out, since he always listens to his mom, and they could just go to her like "Hello Miss. Sunny's mom, can we talk with your son for a minute?". I mean, she pretty much told Sunny about Kel knocking on their door for straight up months, and he finally got out, just imagine if all of them were there.. . So no, i have no sympathy for any of the hooligans (except Charlene and Aubrey, although I'll never consider her a fully-fledged hooligan, if that expression is correct). Angel and MIKHAEL (NOT MAVERICK, MIKHAEL) are repulsive kids who don't see wrong on their actions, they pretty much made Basil's life hell and always tried to pick on Kel, yet they see themselves as the "good guys" and the fandom as the "ahh just a little chicanery, not bullying" guys. Vance is an almost 18 year old acting like a 8 year old, plus he's stupid for stealing candy on the town instead of going to the city, where they don't know him and would be easier without Miss Candice around (Smiley Smiley!). Kim is probably the worst, although not as annoying and hateable as Angel and Mikhael, she's the one to blame for Aubrey's change, she only made things worse for everyone, and while all the rest of the cast (the good guys at least) acknowledge their mistakes, she doesn't even see what she's doing wrong, and I couldn't give less of a f about her caring for Aubrey. It reminded me kinda of Walter and Jesse, with Waltuh caring about him yet pushing him further into the criminal world without thinking how it may affect him. Charlene's actually a genuinely nice girl, she just doesn't have more friends, never actually wants to hurt anyone (as seen in Sunny and Kel vs Angel and her), and is overall just a shy girl who has troubles making friends, probably due to her unusual appearance too. . So yeah, they're not weird kids, they're just bullies. People tend to forget that, although showing dark topics, this game never swears (except for the air conditioning Humphrey), and even Sweetheart has her funny side, or Aubrey's and Kel exaggerated fighting. It's obvious bullies don't act like Mikhael in real life, for example, and I don't know why OMOCAT had to "camouflage" these bullies instead of showing them like they actually are. With HS stuff, like Sweetheart or the slime girls being exaggerated even though they are villains, or Kel and Aubrey fighting, is understandable, due to HS being Sunny's exaggerated and comically bizarre mind. But in RW I think OMOCAT should have went for a real portrayal of the bullies, because they feel like characters ripped out of HS.. . So yeah, I hate the Hooligans and pray every night for their demise (except Charlene and Aubrey) while I also hope for Basil having the worst death ever conceived by a human mind 
All my homies love charlie
The only two that actually seem like bullies are Aubrey and Kim. Everyone else seems pretty chill just havin fun and doing whatever.
I mean Aubrey straight up says that she has been calling basil names and harassing him, and that “soon I wasn’t the only one doing it”. It definitely wasn’t just Aubrey
I really liked them, I love how Aubrey as stuck after the incident as she was still made friends she cared about. And it was cute how they cared about her.
AUBY, NOOO
I think Auby can go to Hero's category and Kel would slip into Auby's category
I always think it's Aubrey shoes (we saw she lose her shoes when he met the other for the first time in the duet)
I disagree slightly,. in the hikkikomori route >!Omori has a sequence (in Black Space I believe) where there's a large crowd of Aubrey's fighting over his affection. Since Black Space is a dream, this is something that Omori wanted to happen, it's something he imagined. Not to mention that dream Aubrey has also been shown to have a crush on Omori. In other words, I don't think Sunny's feelings dissipated.!<
Doesn't Kim have a photo of Aubrey by her bed?
I mean, I have a photo of my best friend by my bed and I'm not in love with them... I don't think it confirms much, but I'd like that ship to happen lol
They both have the same photo with the same frame next to each of their beds
I mean, the look in Aubrey's eyes is less "I am having an emotional moment with a romantic partner (and also my friends are here)" and more "I will drop this lady and then beat you senseless," or even "I will use this lady as a bludgeon to beat you senseless." (Which certainly explains Kim's expression!). . Jokes aside, I'd have to look at the third day more to see if there's scenes of them interacting, but... I keep thinking of three scenes, Kim telling Sunny and Kel that Aubrey's at the church on the first day, the second day secret hideout (post-Hooligans fight) and when she comes to Sunny's house at the start of the third day. In all three cases, Aubrey is pretty clearly not in a good place emotionally (got in a fight with Sunny and Kel and possibly got cut with an actual knife, post-fight again and in a place of old memories with three estranged friends, completely ignoring her friends and shut inside her house), and Kim's response isn't to step forward and do something, it's to leave and to let other people handle it. (Even after this has ended badly twice in a row!). . I'm not going to claim that this means they're not friends, or that this is especially awful; honestly, that'd be a pretty typical response for a sixteen year-old. (Emotions are hard!) But it still paints a picture where even if they're close, Aubrey doesn't treat her as a source of emotional comfort or as a confidante, and Kim doesn't try to cross that wall. And if Kim was intended to be presented as interested in Aubrey romantically, I find it hard to believe that the writing would have her keep that distance.. . (Doubly so when we know Sunny was interested in Aubrey, and that he used to "listen to her talk for hours and hours"--and that's in the context of her dream self talking about feeling like she never "fit in" before she met the others, which suggests that they'd talked about that before. That doesn't make that relationship "better," but it's definitely a stark contrast.)
They don't hate each other though? They annoy/ tease each other.. Mari tells Hero in that memory that they remind her of how the two of them were when they were young. . There's also an easily missable interaction where   the gang talks about how they first met Aubrey, and Kel mentions that he remembers how cute she was to which Aubrey asks "You thought I was cute? Is that why you were always picking on me?"
Out of curiosity, where did that scene show up? I haven't poked around that third day as much as I should have, and I'd like to see it.
You get it if you interact with the pink pinwheel in the middle of the center road with the full party.
Aubrey that's not very nice
Just a friend that was introduced to the group by Aubrey.  >!He's also his partner in crime for covering up the murder.!<
Damn, I need to play the hikikomori route. Clearly I am missing some cool stuff.
Same
Damn I never saw it this way. Great theory :0
-let the lad be happy for once-
He needs to understand that there are multiple types of commitment as well as the difference between commitment and obsession.. . He also needs to learn that it's alright to ask about such things, no one should blame him for not understanding and trying to do so.
Agreed. I think it’s a big thing that’s often overlooked that the game focuses on that each character has made their own mistake, obviously to lesser degree, but significant enough to damage the friend group. Kel resents Aubrey and only acknowledges her at a surface level, Aubrey literally almost does the same thing Sunny did to Basil, and Hero snapped at Kel and abandoned Aubrey, Sunny, and Basil when they needed comforting most. I understand what they did is obviously to lesser degree, but i also don’t believe the game would establish all this, alongside reconciliation, just to have the 3 of them turn around and be almost hypocritical.
I feel like Aubrey is Slytherin for her willingness to use threats and tendency to not have all of society on the same side as her.    . Otherwise this is perfect I reckon
Shes not exactly a strong leader or clever. She makes more brash discussions and thinks by her heart
Fair, I guess? She’s certainly a strong leader of her gang, though I’ll give you the clever part. I just always interpreted the main difference between Gryffindor and Slytherin as whether you usually find a path where most of society would instinctively agree with you. Slytherin’s are usually against the grain while Gryffindors are usually with the grain.    .  I.e. I just can’t see Aubrey’s part in the church fight happening to a Gryffindor (who isn’t the target of an organised hate campaign by the government and a group of racial terrorists)
Neither are most slytherins. Like crab and goyle. . . The only snakes who lived up to there house in the og books where umbridge and voldy.
I think he’s probably dating Aubrey and the whole bullying thing is just some really disturbing roleplay the two are into. Neither one explains this to the rest of to the rest of gang because that would be incredibly awkward.
I love this theory/HC so much! It's the same as mine, with Kel being the first to forgive, then Aubrey, then Hero. I also personally believe that they all forgive one another at one point or another . . . I would love to explain each reason behind each characters reaction and action to the truth but this reply would be an essay long and I don't want that. I do have to bring up the parallel of Mari's death to Basil's almost death on the second (i think) day of real world and how that might impact Aubrey in her reaction to the truth
With aubrey, ill be blunt, it isnt forgiveness. Aubrey isnt the type to drop something like that to the side, frankly i dont think any human is. But...shes just afraid of being alone again. She afraid of seeing sunny pushed any farther than he had been the night before, terrified that shed lose the glimpse of the past shed just been given. She made a similar mistake 2 days ago pushing basil into the lake, almost ending someones life out of frustration, she knows what happens when youre not there when someone needs you. Its all shes thought about for 4 years. She, like hero and kel, would find time to think like people. But for now, they love like family. Life comes later. Friends come now. . . Everything else though, i love what youre bringing to the table! Thank you very much for such fun, differing opinions!
Aubrey
how dare you
👹
Babil and Auby
dawg its been THREE YEARS WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
auby?
# K E L
Aubrey
Aubrey: "Of course it was negative. He never studies!"
I was gonna laugh cause they had Auby as the lead when looking for K, but nevermind, there’s something much funnier
Aubrey burger
AUBY BURGER
Aubrey embrace **B O R G I R**
No way. . Aubrey has burgers on her mind
I pushed my older brother down the stairs and hanged him with the help of my friend Aubrey causing his girlfriend to be depressed. While My innocent blond friend becomes a delinquent while my dead older brothers girlfriend and the blonde boy become enemies, and due to this I repressed the memory so hard I became a sleeping hikkiomori.
I thought it’s because of that one art where Aubrey is black and Lesbian.
 we’re gonna get you ripped!. .  I don’t want to be ripped apart Aubrey!. .  you dummy, I mean we’re gonna get you jacked!. .  please, you can Jack me of my money, just don’t-. .  we’re going to get you in shape you dolt!. .  ohh… okay!
OH MY GOD, AUBREY DW
OMG WELCOME BACK AUBREY-DW 
Thank you Miko!! 😊😊
OMG IS THAT AUBREY FNF???
Beep boop
She really is!
Quietly waits for dream Aubreys time
Why can't everyone stop fighting with your friends and focus on that stupid childish and annoying kid, RW Aubrey
Don't vote out bagel!! Vote DW Aubrey because FA auby is better (pink hair and pronouns)!!!
I mind, I'd rather sacrifice DW Aubrey even though I love her lol
I only want basil out of the way cause he's been known to win popularity in the past, same with Aubrey though so she's next
and aubrey probably
aubrey mom flair
Aubrey's mother does not deserve a flair.
can confirm
Wtf real???
Aubrey's mother and father do not deserve any love from the subreddit
Noooooo  (scered auby noises)


🔪
 (dying noises)


Auby will not succumb
Auby didn't sccumb
auby will not succumb . . >!"You loved basil and you killed him."!<
Meanwhile my dumbass completely skipped all of that and I went to the tree house right after getting all the photos back from Aubrey because I thought there wouldn't be anything new to do.
I constantly rushed sections from a mixture of being eager to see the plot move forward(Headspace hurt a lot because the plot stagnated in a way, but it was intentional because its not supposed to progress anything, the opposite, even!) and because I feared being limited by an invisible timer for some reason. Like doing too much side-stuff would make me miss story content.
i was afraid i'd get spoiled in some way so i straight up rushed headspace and ran from every minor enemy
honestly I'm considering doing a third playthrough and exploring as much as I can of the real world, maybe even aiming to do the true ending, missed so much stuff
Auby and Auby

     Hi!. . \~\~\~\~\~\~ 🧠          Hi!   🧠. . Auby to auby brain communication
FUCK
Yeah I saw that when I went on discord. Well actually my friend saw it and was like "Aubrey isn't that from that game you play?" (Bro shut it about my name. Yes that's my name I'm not saying this again- I love my name because this game bro XD)
And you'd never know unless you went on social media... but that means this was planned for a while, since Aubrey's bday, right?
Yeah. I really like how they did this tbh.
I want to be a Aubrey
yea me too
Is that why he likes Aubrey? 
At some point all the characters (hesitant abt Aubrey but I'm not sure) go to a treehouse in the real world and all go through the stuff there and I think the photo album maybe
oh, yeah, I forgot to say this in the post but I am not nonbinaryaubrey, I just agreed with their posts and wanted to share
Buff Aubrey when? She's like the strongest of them all.
oh my god nonbinaryaubrey reference
they/them aubrey real. . (is nonbinaryaubrey actually someone who's popular enough in the community to warrant referencing them or are you joking about NB Aubrey headcanons?)
(I happen to follow the blog nonbinaryaubrey on tumblr! I was surprised to see them show up here, lol)
Oh, really? I follow them too, haha!
:D
if they ever made an anime, my RW Aubrey voice headcanon would be for sure screwed because my hc for her voice is like...feminine Beetlejuice is the best I can describe it. Very gravely voice. It's like, not even really that feminine, if I ever found an actual voiceclaim for her you would not be able to tell the character is a 16 year old girl from voice alone. The closest I've ever heard to what I imagine for this girl's voice is how CaptainAdorable voices Aubrey in their Omori Meme Dub videos. . . in the way of fanfiction though, I usually consider canon as a suggestion, I wouldn't worry too much about it.
Oh,no those appear in the next arc.... . Also you have an Aubrey flair and I have a Kim flair.. . Untold Rules dictate we must now kiss.
Hold up, age?
. . Dude I was joking I don't even have mouth.. . And I must scream.
No, no, no, rules are rules, we must kiss. I just googled and it’s legal.
. . I couldn't find the gif version,so this will have to do.
. . Gotya homie
Perfection.
Exactly.
What the fuck is that image you edited in
Literally "I have no mouth and I must scream.". . It's a book,then a game, dystopian horror novel, pretty old shit.
Oh damn.
I however have witnessed Aubrey haters
Trying to save Auby and I believe that she's been attacked by bots :(
he does also vehemently defend its honor when aubrey says it sucks. and he also becomes happy when you feed it to him in the real world. :p
That's why I'm flaired as Aubrey 😎
With drinking the can he just wanted to show Aubrey that Orange Joe is "still kicking", but.... . 
It was expired what did you expect
Call me aubrey because it looks like shit 
A non-Orange Joe heretic
I need a fanart or plushie-pic where aubrey gets her hands on these babies
She would BURY herself with these lmao
AUBREY
Aubrey for sure
Aubrey's me lol
Aubrey. She has pure peak
wait nevermind aubrey's selection is mostly good
I just realised all those albums were under Aubrey, so I’m picking Aubrey
Aubrey just for Slipknot
aubrey cuz loveless
CLOSE MY EYES, FEEL ME NOW. . (ofc Aubrey is a mbv fan)
Aubrey likes PTV, so definitely her
LOFI AUBREY RN!!!! 
Not yet no, I saw some meme videos though and Aubrey seems to be affiliated with it
Please don't get spoiled
I already have, I know a good chunk of the lore
Yeah I've been spoiled, I have like 1.6 hours on the game and don't wanna continue fr
TIL I’m only slightly taller than Aubrey
Ye well at least you're not shorter.
Oof…
TIL i'm slightly shorter than Aubrey
same kinda
I am almost as tall as real world aubrey. Almost.
DW Aubrey's height is 143. . Aubrey!s birthday is the 143rd day of the year . . 143 means I Love You
AAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaqqaqqAaAaaaaaAAAAAAAA
I am almost as tall as Aubrey and I'll take that as a win
Aubrey’s taller then me? 🤔 
Mfw i'm 3cm smaller than Auby
I thought I'm at least higher than Aubrey... Always tgought she's pretty short.
I- I’m shorter than real world Aubrey…. . I’m am crying.
Last time i checked im exactly 1 cm shorter than Aubrey, but since that was well over a month ago im probably taller
They do, but they also generally die in one turn this way (unless you miss which, admittedly, does happen with happy). Also get more exp then if they were sad. Happy Aubrey tanks it very well.. . Sad locking them is definitely safer tho.
If youre higher than a certain level, this strat is definitely best, but if youre still like under lvl 15ish, totally just sad lock lmao
Sorry, Aubrey is absorbing our EXP like a sponge
As one of the combat-enjoyers of omori, I always give Aubrey the XP book
I gave her the book.. . She is now illuminating green.
everyone is like “you have to reach this level” but to be honest, the best strategy is to level up as much as needed for Aubrey to have the counter skill, then all you have to do is Aubrey-Counter, Hero-Cook for Aubrey and the others attack
Well I googled like a trillion times and the only one i got as aubrey... im just helping folks out man 😓
I know this is old but i just want to know how can I water Aubrey's gladius until 9999? I'd love to try that
> That, my dear friend, is the true power of last resort, if you water Basil's flowers until Aubrey has 9999 heart. So in the end, Auby is the winner of this game! Have fun farming flowers until your mortal lifespan ends.. . Is it really possible? Aren't the flowers waterable only for a limited amount of time?
Lol, it looks like a coin collection app.
It be time to turn the children into coins
Thank you for helping get the word out! If anyone needs help, they can also contact me!. . Fun fact:  and  are two different Omojis that exist because  were replaced with

You managed to get it to work! I saw a lot of notifications where you where having problems . . Anyways, know I'm waiting for the guy with the Mike Ehrmantraut PFP to figure it out too! Yo Mike, need any help, DM without problems !

***Thank you random citizen***
My pleasure . Please also check out Mr-Sir0 and leave some upvotes for him since he was the one who found the codes, and I don't want to "steal" all his merit. He pretty much did everything, I just posted it on the OMORI sub to help others!
MIKE
this being a reply to [deleted] emits powerful Spamton vibes
Lmao yeah. . It was actually Mike, Waltuh's best friend
Saw a lot of notifications. Want me to lend you a hand with any questions??
Click the 3 dots to copy my message and try to paste it . . If it works, then all the others will work on IPad if you save it and change the digits . . If not, I'm sorry I can't be of any more help 

I think I just saw what's wrong!. . In the notifications, I saw that you were using backslashes \\. . Try to delete those, maybe that's the issue?
 YAY! 


 
YAY IT WORKS
    
The 4 Aubys of the apocalypse + Kel the knight

OMG IT WORKED TY
You're welcome my friend, please also check Sir0 post, I'm just the mailman, he was the one who found the codes haha. Leave him some upvotes and nice comments too 

. . Oh shit it does work. . !\[img\](emote|t5\31hpy|21598)
Check on IAmVeryBored comment on this same post, he was able to make them all work. If you can't, copy his message where you'll find every OMOJI 
Be careful of slashes \\\\\. They are used to show codes, but they won’t display the Omoji.
Shouldn’t that be hashtags? Whatever, thanks for the advice
Well, it’s displayed like this: !\[img\](emote|t5\31hpy|21598). . But it has slashes in it. \\\\\\ not hashtags #. . You need to remove the backslashes for this to look like this: 

i love him
Saw you tried to do it and didn't work. Need any help? (Serious, not trying to be rude)
!\[img\](emote|t5\31hpy| 2465) Yay! Old omojis are back! Thank you and u/Mr-Sir0 for  saving  them!  \^\^
￼​￼​￼​￼​￼​
Need some help? Feel free to try as many times as you need in this comment section too, it's no problem! 
It doesn’t work when I copy and paste the omoji itself, it just copies nothing and pastes nothing.. . Let’s see if this works 
It did work!. . Now save that omoji source code by copying the comment and pasting it on your notes/clipboard and just change the digits for any omoji you want 
I probably wouldn’t have understood how tf you do it without this post tbh . . Gotta try them all just to make sure. . . . . . . . . . Yay Auby 
img. I failed :(
:2464:
Im so confused... what am I doing wrong?
21603
Need help? 
Lol I think so
Sorry for not answering yet, I had to go to sleep cuz of university . . Anyways, quickest way to get these:. . 1. Get in your phone and search for a Derpy Kel, Sad Aubrey or some other deleted omoji (preference those that include only the OMOJI and no text). 2. 3 dots, copy those. Paste it in a comment to see if it works. 3. If it does, go to your notes/clipboard and paste it. You will see the code has a bunch of digits at the end. 4. Now just change the digits to the OMOJI you want, take a SS of the codes to know each of them for example. . In case it didn't work, don't worry to contact again . . Remember, phone only!!
Thank you very much!
No problem friend, let me know if you need more help, no problem at all! 
>this fandom is so starved for content that I believe literally minutes after the switch and PS4 releases we'll have literally every sprite and line that might be added completely drained of content. . This will happen. Maybe not in minutes, but definitely in a day or two. It's not like it's exclusive to Omori, it happens to pretty much all games that don't have frequent updates.  . . . This community still exists mostly because of memes and fanart, but sadly, not all memes are created to be good which is why we need a dedicated anti-spam rule targeted towards posts like you mentioned earlier in your comment.
"wha--??? aubrey loves transphobia😳😳😳??? that's even crazier the 10th time😂😂😂😂"
This isn't even remotely funny or cute or literally fucking anything. This is just spam that clogs the subreddit feed and makes it harder to find quality posts.
Yeah, it’s really annoying and it’s making it way more exhausting to scroll through the sub
Ironically, there are no spamming rules on this sub which is why this kind of this is post becomes common to find
Well then we need to protest so we can get spamming rules
I mean I just uploaded Wise Rock to shitpost but perhaps feeding the karma farm trend was a mistake.
But fr though it just be karma farmin.
No offense but why does it make you mad? You can just keep scrolling and ignore them when you see them. The time it takes is so small I’d say it’s virtually a non factor seeing them that often.. Your day been bad or something?
Thank you so much!! I used this with just the chicken ball and the ol' reliable, and defetead her in 4 rounds (just repeated the last one without Aubrey)
Equip and use stat-reducing skills as much as possible (especially attack). It's incredibly how significantly they change things.
Check this out, if you still need it! 
this page seems to be gone so here's a link to an archived version of it for anyone else who needs help [
Omg tysm! This helped a lot! I defeated them my first try! :D
Well the haunted pool at the last resort has someone you can buy the group emotion items it's better then using abilities to change emotion


this is a 2yo post how tf
I'm fighting slime girls rn
same, im on my third try... I WAS SO CLOSE!
me too !
right now doing it
im doing it now and its a pain in the arse 
four years now and there's still new people coming here for help
and yet we still flock

THIS IS A 2YO POST HELP
 i'm lvl 24


HELP ME IM FIGHTING HER RIGHT NOW, ANY TIPS AND TRICKS?? 😭😭
grind to level 30 lol. . make sure aubrey and kel always have their emotion skills and items available

gang im level 21 (highest) .... how long will this take me 


 i'm lvl 24
You're too early, there's something else you have to do (ask where Aubrey is, even if you already know you can't skip that part of the story)
„Dude why u goin to church we need to find aubrey“ . „Let me go in man I’ve seen people talk about this“
How do I get the dynamite?. . Edit: turns out you can defeat him without the dynamite. Awesome.
(im a litt late but). OMG IT WORKED TO WELL THANK YOU I WAS STUCK IN THIS LEVEL FOR SO LONG BUT YOUR ADVICE WORKED SO WELL AND FAST THANKS!!. and fyi, I did find this through Google search :)
no problem! i was also stuck on this boss for while lol
Don't know if you're gonna see this but please tell me where is TV girl?
she was in otherworld iirc, in her TV-shaped house. there’s a secret path u need to take, try searching around or google it
Not sure if you even need this answered anymore but I commented a very similar strategy ages ago. The reason you don't want to enrage Aubrey is because enraging her makes her a glass cannon. If she toast, furious omori is surely going to be toast as well.
I know it's been 4 years, but can anyone help?. I have two main problems.. .  1. I don't have the dynamite. I didn't even pick it up when I had the chance, so now I don't have it. . .  2. the security guards never disappear, it doesn't matter if they die in the same round, the boss always calls and a new security guard appears before the next round. . PLEASE HELP ME 🙏🙏🙏 
OH MY FUCKING GOD I DON’T HAVE HACK AWAY AHHHHHH I FUCKING HATE MYSELF
You'll get a game over if you lose the first fight against Aubrey in Faraway Park, but all subsequent fights don't matter.
Makes sense, since you usually end it in one turn
Where do you find them? In lost library as of now and would like to try
this was one of the second to last achievements I needed for completion and I was struggling, thank you!!!
I just cheesed the endgame bosses with Angry Auby headbutts
I imagine it will be worded differently because it would be Aubrey who speaks the message. Different messenger, different expressions you know.
Yeah, Aubs never failed to deliver some peak speeches, hopefully this time she'll be cooking as well.
Long auby
While looking a playthrough the mod I was wondering this. . If OMORI was trying to save his friends by killing them. . Why does bro needed it to be the most violent and painful . I mean Aubrey got fucking chewed up
That Amy hammer for Aubrey is terrifying 
fucking aubreys gonna get shanked in the church put her soul in heaven same day delivery
Maybe, but I am mainly putting priority on another mod where Aubrey gets him out instead. Hopefully, I can get Day 1 finished and just release it as a demo before continuing.
After much pain, I used several Aubrey nukes to defeat Perfectheart. . . I don’t think my Kel had a chicken ball if I remember correctly, so he couldn’t one shot Perfectheart. So I went with Aubrey with her high health count build. It was a cycle of last resort, life jam, and whole chicken. It was glorious.
To explain further; the mod takes place during the 3 days, but specifically Aubrey gets him out instead.. . Also, you can't say no. Selecting "DO NOTHING" simply gives a grace period, but going to your door causes Aubrey to break in anyways.. . This specific segment takes place on Day 1.
Damn. . She doesn't accept no as an answer
 Aubrey Breaks Sunny's Door Down?


show me the mod download this fucking instant or i SWEAR TO GOD I WILL SUMMON THE WRATH OF A THOUSAND ENRAGED AUBREYS 
YOOOOOOOOO watafak 🫥. U want some tea?
So, OMORI plot but it's Aubrey?
Yep
Yandere Auby?
Mixed hikikomori route. Sunny saw Aubrey as a delinquent with pink hair. He shut himself back in because he didn't enjoy the worst parts of that day, though he liked the pink hair because it was cute and brought back memories of that rainy day.. . A few years after moving to the city, he's still a shut-in going into Headspace, and he's repressed the worst parts of that experience, much like he suppressed his memory of pushing Mari down the stairs. Headspace Aubrey remains a representation of the type of person he's attracted to, and that's... matured a bit due to him spending most of his time awake watching anime and playing video games. This is the result.
This is lowkey so cute SOB. i love the effort you put into this text 🫶🫶
HAHA RYU WHAT ARE U DOING HERE
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WHILE 
It is a mod or?
I'm redesigning characters for my mod, yes. Aubrey is part of it :).. I was testing how she looks and if everything works
Dirty and faceless
WHAT
(I thought they'd get the reference, I'm leaving 😭)
NO I'M SORRY... I don't know the reference!! Is there a video or picture to link? 
Yeah I think that was the idea behind the mod. RIP Blue haired male Aubrey.
Oh indeed

HUH?!
That escalated quickly...
Aye yup, she may be a bit of a dormant punk rocker. I mean, Hikki of the Valley's Headspace Aubrey has pink hair dammit!
Its a dating sim where you are destained to date aubrey?
yeah, the letter you can find in the room before the neighbourhood from headspace aubrey to dreamer (or omori? but it says dreamer) makes you wonder what fates the headspace friends met
theres a letter?????
Snuy and Auby <3
I generally just like to imagine my favorite characters of any game/show/book as gay because IM gay and I like to see myself in my favorite characters. I know they’re not canonically gay (unless they are, in which case even better). Like I really like Aubrey as a character and in my imagination I like to think of her as a lesbian. Is Aubrey a lesbian? No.
I’m starting to think Aubrey was onto something. . 
Seems like Aubrey was right when she called him a creep.
2* defense on Aubrey???. . I used her as my tank for the entire game.. . 3 times.
hero died 2nd to Kel until I got Counter on Aubrey.. . then the strat against most enemies and bosses was to do as much damage as possible with Kel and Omori (use kel for emergency heals cuz speeeeddd) then use counter on Aubrey and Cook on Aubrey.  since Hero is slow as all fuck, he goes after the enemies and Aubrey starts the next turn full.. . if there's an AOE move or a multi-target move (like Hack Away, that hits more than once on random enemies, but your enemies have it to attack you) this doesn't work cuz Aubrey's counter just doesnt work with these.. . made the Sir Maximuses hard
You mean like… the Aubrey love letter thing…
He did have a crush on Aubrey, however i think that changed. Idk i think theres def some reciprocation. Again the handholding seems pretty damn mutual since this is headspace and Sunny is kinda controlling what happens. Sunny even sketched him and Basil holding hands in black space. And if im honest hand holding to me is much more a symbol of love than friend ship. Plus they added the new tags that really have them being handsy. And the new release energy that has is also them holding hands. Sure you can be like, thats just a friend hand hold but i think switch it with Aubrey and everyones saying its a confirmed ship. All Aubrey got was a high five, JUST LIKE KEL. Aubrey got friendzoned
I do get your point that maybe not everyone would initially be like confirmed ship with Aubrey, but im pretty certain a large portion would. And tbf if they did hold hands i probably would be more into sunburn but the fact they made Aubrey get a high five only to have Basil get the handhold seems so friendzoney to aubrey. . . So blackspace and blackspace 2 i believe are meant to represtent like repressed memories. And tbf its a weird memory, idk if id say its a lovey scene. Maybe aubrey got the letter but rejected him which is why its repressed? Idk thats a pretty weird scene so i have no real idea if im honest. And tbf in blackspace in the sketchbook theres a drawing of you and Basil holding hands in front of pictures so idk. . . And i get thay sometimes kids do hold hands but the amount of times they do it, plus the release energy is pretty romantic looking and idk i think again make a girl and guy hold hands, more people say its romantic. Since im gay i think i just see how a guy and guy hold hands like how straight people see a guy and girl hold hands so idk. They seemed handsy. . . And yeah i like debating on topics like this and especially when i feel like something does lean like it does.
Those are all valid points! Yeah, Black Space is... interesting  It's tough to interpret some areas very conclusively, even excluding the ones that are pure subconscious nonsense.. . And I'm pan myself, so I can definitely see where you're coming from  I see things like holding hands the same way no matter the genders, but our society is certainly a heteronormative one.
Yeah its definitely so up in the air. Like all the doors and their different meaning. The one in the river caught me so off guard. Its really hard to begin ti understand. . . And cool! And idk i think its so weird how everyone is like immediately writing off the muliple hand holds. Like my mind immediatepy was like "oh gay" which my mind still is. And tbf i do ship a lot of gay ships but i never defend them, cause its just ships, this i feel like is an integral part of the game and a ship i think is the most correct
If you're reffering to that one cutscene in Faraway... sorry, but it's fanmade.
İ think he means the blackspace one,where it orginated
Yeah

Welcome to the family son
What does this mean
Resident Evil 7
Oh alright, I don't game
...But you're in a game subreddit
Let's plays are a thing, you know? Even though I haven't played (or watched it tbh) I know the overall story and I like the fandom, y'all are sweet :). Also the computer at my house is a 9-year-old laptop with full space and probably would explode, and I don't have a credit card so I'd have to pirate it on my phone and I don't feel like it
Ah fair enough. Resident Evil 7 is a fun horror game to watch btw, i think you'll enjoy it
Btw cloud gaming services like GeForce Now are a godsend for old computers. It's how I managed to play through some of the Resident Evil games on my potato laptop before I got my PC
Is it free?
There is a free service, though you can only play for an hour in a single sitting, you only have access to the 1060 graphics card, and there will be a waiting line. Still managed to play through Death Stranding like that so it still works well if you're a little patient (playing in the night reduces the wait time). . You still need to own the game on Steam or Epic Games though so keep that in mind
Oh well. I ain't doing it then.. But thanks a lot for the tip, maybe I'll keep it in mind for the future, who knows :D
Do you live at her house too?
I think you arrived at aubrey's
Five nights at Aubrey's
The OP must have went to an abondoned house for the roleplay lol

#AUBREY
Aubrey just like me fr
As a 22 y.o guy, I am officially shorter than Aubrey!. . 
Also 22, same lol. . 
(I'm actually 172cm tall so barely visible ok?...)
And I could be slightly taller then aubrey as a 20 y.o guy
Hello, 24 here and I'm Omori's size lmaooo
fuck i am smaller than aubrey
Im shorter then Aubrey... 
I had a pretty bad nutrition during my teenage years too and I ended shorter than Aubrey as well (well, I'm 172cm so barely noticeable but still) so it's definitely possible, also 1,69m for a teenage boy is a bit short so it doesn't shock me.
Aubrey and peanut have something in common.
Aubrey and me: same age, same height 
I refuse to believe Aubrey's taller than me
I'm slightly shorter than Aubrey, very poggers
I am auby size! 
Please make a Aubrey plush your the first one to make a custom plushie for a decent price

I also did not notice that.
Dude I noticed this months ago and was like "wait wtf"
Imo it’s either “eye color shows emotions” or “omocat just thought the colors blend better that way”, I don’t think she actually has lenses but definitely could be the case as well. Also, some extra note to the emotions thing, only her eyes being a different color makes sense too since Aubrey is the one that really changed a lot compared to the rest.
Yeah! I though the only reason for her eyes to be that way is her color palette, but I figured this would be the “canonical” explanation.
How did you come to that first possibility?
It’s kinda commonly used in a lot of games (best example I can give is the show Arcane tho)
I get that but OMORI just never felt like that and she shows quite a bit of emotions while keeping the blue eyes so I just don't see it
It's possible her eyes are different colors because she doesn't want to see her mother in her own reflection.
i forget if this was just a memory of many headcanons / fics or if there is actually an in game quote related to this on like the swingset or something, but I'm pretty sure that Aubrey tried to change her appearance to distance herself from the past and what happened, trying to showcase an external change.
Yeah she did, op says she has colored lenses too and that makes sense, I just thought from how heavy the game goes into emotions; how emotionally different she is and how her eye color has changed might correlate with each other
I just realized that the ones reading the space boyfriend comic are Kel, Aubrey and Mari not Kel, Aubrey and Sunny
My life has been a lie all along
Theory: Aubrey actually has bad eye sight, but thinks glasses will ruin her street credit
I dunno, her bestie Kim wears them, and she seems fine with that.
bruh lmao  . Also aubery is the best written character throughout the whole story  . i will fight you
but aubyy uwu?
huh?
Im making a joke about this fandoms tendencies to over simplify the characters personalities
oh ok
yes she has contacts
Yea I think it's time for an omori circlejerk sub
When I saw her eyes in the real world for the first time I just thought her eyes were always blue, but then I saw the other pictures of her before the time skip and was very fcking confused
You just noticed?-
Yeah tbh I was so confused when we first met her in the real world and her eye color had changed
When I first saw her, my immediate thought was it was “oh, just a headspace thing for the aesthetic”, and then I saw the photos of Small Aubrey
I thought that was kinda obvious, they stand out considering basically everyones eyes look the same
Omg i never notice that!
how did i not notice that
I’m just as surprised as you (also, nice Margo profile picture)
Would love if the characters all ended up just having different coloured eyes as a result of being deep in their feelings
The fact that seemingly 2k people didn't know that baffles me
Nah she evolving
I've noticed it for a while.. she's so cute
\*Trans headcanon intensifies\*
Top tier headcanon tbh
Oh shit
i noticed a little bit after seeing her
Character development.
Ayo what
Nice
Wow Aubrey really became emo
The power of colored lenses
It’d make sense too! I didn’t knew about that
girl was desperate to be an anime character 💀
i thought her eyes just changed
She’s evolving
Especially Aubrey
And the tissues
Whitespace wasn't always white



I mean, Aubrey School...
He didn’t know Aubrey was like that until he left his house
Current Aubrey isnt really mean either.. . And past aubrey likely isnt as all "sun shine and rainbow" like the Headspace one is either.
the villain was auby
Aubrey using the microbots sounds so badass
aubrey doing anything sounds badass
ohh my goddddd gimmeee thattt
THAT WAS HIS MISTAKE
I wanna buy Aubrey for$589

Finally another fellow Aubrey hater 
Aubrey doesn't deserve to be there. 

but your reddit avatar thing looks like aubrey
. . Why?
Might just be me but i dont see aubrey
Because Aubrey is the worst and doesn't deserve to be at my birthday.
AUBREY DOESNT DESERVE TO BE ON MY CAKE!
idgaf abt aubery i wanmt auber
Ah, yes, I'm sorry, I misunderstood. Auber was actually ill and so couldn't make it. . . Maybe next year I can have Auber on my cake.

How to get one of Aubrey (I'm her #1 fan and as dedicated if not more to my wife Aubrey 🥳😋)
I didn’t know that auby made it in! I saw our attempt to build her in the first area but it got overwritten.
does anyone know the coordinates of Aubrey though?
Don't have the coords right now but she's to the northwest of the upper Belgium/German flag intersection, right under one of the Warrior Cats logos. Or you can just go straight west from White Space until you see her.

Time To Drink Water
When I found Aubrey's eggplant-shaped stuffed toy while first playing the game, I thought I was really clever for coming up with the "I guess you could call it an aubrey-gine :)" joke.. . It took me way too long to realize that "Aubrey sounding a little like Aubergine" is probably the reason she has an aubergine doll in the first place.
Aubrey saw what happens when you cast a spell you don't know 
ayo aubrey unlocked stasis

So... Aubrey became Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat? Niceeee!

You were interested in more sprite ideas:. . RW Aubrey swinging back from a nailbat swing and accidentally stabbing or hurting herself with her own nails on the bat (trying to get it back into an 'on the shoulder' neutral position after having swung it and hitting her own shoulder a little too hard). . Sunny sitting on a bench daydreaming about Headspace . . Omori doing some sick knife tricks (on one hand, from hand to hand, throw and catch, whatever you want). . HS Hero doing a little dance with one hand in the air and the other covering his nose (he is underwater). . HS Basil inserting a straw and taking a slurp out of his own head before discreetly putting it back. . HS Kel doing squats while simultaneously riding on ice skates. . HS Aubrey hugging the daylights out of Omori (he can only accept the situation). . RW Mari skipping rope
I definitely won't be able to make all of these, but I'll try one or two
Yeah that's fine I was just spitballing, you can choose whichever ones you like.

&#x200B;. . 
THIS IS NOT A DRILL AUBY IS SOLD OUT

Yay
The real reason she become a delinquent
HOLY SHIT. . I am so glad I got them all the second they came out, they sold out fast
Yeah everyone thought I was exaggerating when I said I was putting everything else on hold and camped the store page out of fear of missing out. Glad I didn't listen to them. Bought Omori Auby and Mari...then after 10 minutes panicked and bought the rest. They were gone so quick.
Im more surprised they all didnt get sold out within 2 mins lol
plot twist: she is one of the most beloved characters which is why omocat made a lot more aubreys  



Poor Aubergine 

Aubergine became sad
Ourbry  (she was turned ourble)
Oh no


I bought Aubrey and Basil, if that makes you feel any better ;-,
~~now ship them!~~

I literally just bought her, so she no longer feels lonely. Still tho, jeez man, I knew Omori fans would go crazy for them but it’s only been an hour and they’re all nearly sold out. We’re practically savages 
Shame I'm not a plush person. I'd totally buy auby
This confirms Aubrey is the least liked character! . . /j
NO /J (/j) 
I bought her like 20 minutes ago :)
Just checked the store, shes now sold out too
Aw man... I didn't realize they released today and just checked and like, EVERYTHINGS sold out.... I wonder why they dont just like, make a section where you can order it after its sold out but itll just take a lot longer to get to you cause production....
JUSTICE FOR AUBY
lore accurate lol
The only survivor
Auby 
Wait I didn’t know they were selling plushes already
I got omori 🥹
she’s the only one i got too
Auby is OK, she's coming to me now 
WHY ARE THEY ALL FUCKING SOLD OOOOUUUUTTT 
ugh i knew they would sell quickly.. but hey at least they're not 60$ so that's already something great!
I hate time zones, i missed it
Howwwww thats the one i would have wanted most T-T
I would have thought she would be in the first 3 to sell out
I don't even get why. She was the only one I was going to buy until I lost control and bought all of them.
i bought her, but she was like my sixth choice (in case i couldn’t get them all). . poor auby.
I wanna get an omor
i bought her, she’s the cutest out of all of them!!
Oh god its the fumos all over again, next time we'll be having site crashes
Pretty sure the website wouldn’t load earlier
LMAO Fr I was refreshing to see how long it’d take for her to sell out (tbh I could’ve bought her but I’d feel bad letting my mom give me money for one- also I wanna save for the bomber jacket-) and the whole page crashed LMAO
I want one but I'm broke :'(
THEY'RE OUT OF STOCK ALREADY????
Does anyone know when they’re going to get restocked?
. The twitter page said they’ll plan for preorders in the future for restocks prob
FUCK I DIDNT KNOW THEY WENT ON SALE ALREADY
I noticed that too. Like damn everyone is sold out out then there's Auby.
I was 2 dollars off with my guess damn
I bought the whole gang (my wallet hates me)
That’s like.. $168 
Dont remind me 
Auby 
Auby 
Auby 
Auby 
lol I bought the omor at 8:06
Wait God damn it I didn't know they were already being sold.

They should be! There’s a feature that will notify you when they’re back in stock
NOOOO I COMPLETLEY FORGOT ABOUT THE PLUSHIES TODAY, NOW THEY ARE SOLD OUT, WHY WORLD WHYYYYYYY
They sold out in the first 5 mins of being released. Wow.
Noooo aub the 
HAHAHAH
wtf already??
Ya'll invited to my wallet's funeral....
She sold out before you could sell your organs 
They all gone now
FUCK I MISSED IT
I have only just woken up as they didn’t launch until midnight in the uk…this doesn’t seem fair
No way Auby wasn't sold out
Objective: survive
THEY’RE 28 QUID.
I had no idea these released please god tell me theres gonna be a restock I want them so bad

Only had money for  and . I wish I could've taken the all with me 
why are plushies limited run like consistently? i feel like they're trying to make FOMO but i really don't have the resources to buy plushies the moment they drop
Buy her
She sold out like 30 minutes later and I didn’t have money 
Sad
Ah well didn't know these were a thing bet I missed them
Sadly you did
Basil and Kel were gone in 5 minutes. . the rest (except aubrey) followed not 3 minutes later
Buy them all
I was a little late to the listing so Aubrey was all that was left when I got there. I'm worried she'll call me a prick when she arrives.
I am among those who helped to make little Auby feel included.. . (Sadly, Basil was sold out, and Kel sold out literally as I was entering my payment info. Otherwise, the whole gang is on the way.)
Oh ohh the misery
i have no money
She was the only one I could buy in time
One of of my freinds who also likes OMORI snaged the Aubrey plush seeing it was the only one that wasn't sold out
Where do I buy them
Something just doesn't sit right with me buying a plushie of a little girl.

Who was the first to sell out?
turtles in a half shell
Wield it like a weapon! Experience what Aubrey feels while holding this!
You implying Aubrey beats up people with a body pillow? Now that's wild
we now finally know what the in game weapon that aubrey can equip canonically looks like. . btw >!perfectheart!< is on the other side
what, a hormone induced mess of a human being? >!BS2's infamous Aubrey scene!< already made that clear
There’s nothing sexual in that scene though, it’s a really innocent scene representing a relatable desire to an extreme.
hormones are not exclusively sexual, they can heavily influence mood and I'm sure plenty of hormonal moody teenagers have had dreams of their crush being absolutely starry eyed for them
make an aubrey one and I'm sold-
Aubrey is 16
and I'm 17, l+ratio + you fell off + ur white+ you get no hoes.
jokes are supposed to be funny
I'm not even white
Have you not seen the copypasta?
I haven't seen yet original one I've only seen variations of it
Yeah those are some of the add ons lol
Aubrey plush stepping on Omori plush

Polly is Aubrey's dad 😱 (Not Clickbait)
Slime girls, black space 2 with Aubreys
Not super horny, but still horny. Case in point: HS Aubrey and the slime girls
If Aubrey were to just remove her eye contacts she'd look just like Bocchi but angry.
But can she shred doe
Shred her enemies in pieces. . 
This is what Kel thinks a daughter between Sunny and Aubrey would look like because he thinks Aubrey's pink hair is hereditary.. . 
She looks like Aubrey but actually cute
Aubrey has always been cute and funny
she does look like Aubrey tho
Aubrey is sad that this is a Wendy's.
"Why doesn't OMORI look at me like that?"
Omori likes what he sees, Aubrey is jealous
Aubrey's sad cuz wendy roasted her
happi auby :]
Happy Auby best Auby :>
Ober🍊
HOLY SHIT. . LOOK AT HER FUCKING GO
aubys fuckin poppin off.
Blessed
She spin
now do the realworld aubrey but like four years ago (not in headspace, you know. >!before Mari sorta broke every bone in her body down the stairs!<)
I actually planned to make more characters spin in the future, so I guess it wouldn't hurt to do that one as well :D.
Well, I just sorta made it more intense than it needed to be. I can't tell if you're saying that because >!of the rope!<
>!I thought the mom noticed!<
>!Lets not forget that a broken violin was at the end, its certainly painful!<
>!True True, if anything more happened either the researches are really dumb or *Them* would need to do more to fake her su1c1d3!<
HOW
spin
Wholesome :)
Speeeeeeeeeeeeeen
auby
The happiness is out of bounds with this.
She lives in Spain but without the a
I have a feeling that the original joke was about "Spain but without the s". I like this one better, tho:>

Happi auby

I mean,I wouldn't say I **love** Kel because there were certainly better ways to deal with the entirety of RW Aubrey's problem that would result in less damage to everyone...quite literally seeing as they kinda fought thought the whole town just to get to Aubrey and they could EASILY just waited a bit so they wouldn't burn Aubrey's film there.. . Yeah,yeah,the plot would be less impactful but I'm still siding with Aubrey on the whole Church fiasco...but I'm a Kel enjoyer at the end of the day still.
sunny killed his sister, covered it up as a suicide, abandoned all of his friends and literally stabbed aubrey with a knife. basil helped sunny cover up a murder, kept their pictures all for himself, destroyed the memories and last remnants of the times where mari was alive and then painted aubrey as the bad guy when she stole the album. hero, who was the old and responsible one, moved far away and completely cut off contact with everyone. kel has no sense of limits and literally invaded a church, interrupted aubrey's prayer to talk about something she's clearly traumatized about and started a shouting match, and brings up their old dead friend every time aubrey does something he deems wrong, knowing fully that he is adding fuel to the fire. all of them have faults. you clearly missed the point of the game and don't have the slightest idea of what trauma does to people.
i know what trauma does to people but when has that ever been an excuse for being an asshole?. . i have played the game to 100% and adore it, i understand its exploration of grief and different depictions of it as well as the effects of trauma. But trauma isnt an excuse to act in any of the ways you mentioned above!
absolutely, but what makes one an asshole isn't just their acts, but the refusal to get better, and that absolutely doesn't apply to any of them
they do get better and i simply just dont think the time that they progress is realistic at all. in most routes they all develop and grow in like 3 days- im sorry i just DONT believe that everyone can grow and forgive eachother in the span of 2-3 days
respectable aubrey stan
Aubrey (rw) can step on me idm 
\*points\* *down bad* . . (/lh)
Aubrey's mom
She seems like she has some kind of mental illness making her unresponsive, so I don’t think she deserves hate either. She is a really bad mom though.
I legit thought she was drugged out or something
I think it’s heavily implied that she’s an addict of some kind. I’ve known plenty of addicts in my lifetime and all of their houses looked like Aubrey’s.
Dang, I had no clue being an addict pixelates your house
If so then she definitely needs to be rehabilitated, no child deserves to live in a house like that
She has my sympathy for her illness but she doesn't have anyone's forgiveness
I think it’s less of an illness and more of negligence and substance abuse
The only ship with Kim that I appreciate is Aubrey x Kim.
Good
I honestly think some of her undeserved hate is just the fact that female characters get less leeway to just be fucked up in general. I don't mean this in some kinda "Aubrey did no wrong" way or blaming all her fandom hate on systemic prejudice, but there's certainly something there. She's the best written character in the game after sunny, but people pass her off as just a stupid bully. Like, everyone in the town hates her and before they hated her they ignored her need for help. Losing all her friends to their grief certainly didn't help, but I'd put money on if she had just been given reliable access to decent food and a half decent parental figure every issue with basil would've been avoided.. . I know some people also think she's like their old school bullies, which is fair but it doesn't make actual media analysis. My projection bias is actually kel, I did not like him on my first playthrough and I still prefer not spending much time on him in fandom because it was his types that really fucked me up in school. He's nice sure, but he's so popular nobody would ever call him on his bullshit except hero or Aubrey.. . He has no emotional awareness and he never gets called on it or otherwise realizes it's an issue. Like I got so pissed at him when he was looking for a high five after seeing Aubrey bullied out of what seemed like her only safe space by grown adults. Like at least acknowledge she's in a fucked up mental state, I knew the game had suicide and at that point I was honestly thinking we'd find Aubrey dead somewhere and this man is just like yay we did it! Aubrey absolutely needed confronted, hell she needed confronted in a place she couldn't run away from, but to then ignore the suspiciously antagonistic general population? Idk man. I know kel slander isn't tolerated much lol but he has issues that need working on too, and again I don't hate him but the fact that nobody seems to acknowledge his issues bothers me.
aubrey deserves all the hate! :DDDD. . ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|tableflip). .  haha lol get bonked
“deserved aubrey hate” nahhhh stfu
i hate her so much heh, i cant help myself!
unfortunately, this ratio
![gif](emote|freeemotespack|tableflip). . . . oh no!
what even caused you to have such a bad take. who hurt you
i think the same about your take. lets leave it there shall we.
Aubrey fans pushing their old friend into a lake knowing full well he can't swim (the pizza was not here)
I hate when people think of Aubrey as “Aubrey’s a badass! She would beat up anyone!”. . No, she won’t. She’s a child acting out on her emotional problems. She’s just as prone to cry as Basil.
At least three of the characters in the game did objectively horrible things by most standards of morality and the others made mistakes too. I don't get why anyone is into pitting the characters against each other, that's not really the point. Most children aren't accustomed to >!seeing someone they trust die!<. Aubrey probably would have done the exact same thing as Omori and Basil, if nobody had shown up to stop her. Aubrey also is implied to have been engaged in patterns of hurting people for multiple years, which is ultimately pretty equivalent to a traumatic and disparaging lie. The point is that they all grow up and learn how to stop such situations from ever happening again in the good ending.
i think anyone who genuinely hates either character is silly. Basil was traumatised and grew heavily depressed, and it doesn't help aubrey, once his extremely close friend (shown to be the one who actually introduced him to the group) started bullying him.. . But it's not surprising aubrey became an aggressive bully. Is it a good response? no, she hurt people around her, but she was distraught by what happened, no on consoled her, and she lashed out.. . Both of them clearly showed signs of trauma in their own ways and nobody should *hate* the characters for it.
i think people are entitled to hate characters they want and that it is not silly, i can see the actions behind their behaviour and still show disdain for them. they dont exist, so its all g
true but i think it can be harmful to spread hatred for a character based on their trauma responses. could lead to similarly hating a person for their real life trauma responses without understanding what that person is going through.. . you can say "this reaction is shitty" while understanding WHY they had that reaction. Instead of just calling them a crappy person and ignoring their struggles.
I know what their struggles are and I still dislike them. I do say "this reaction is shitty" and I understand why it happens (death of a family member, poor treatment from family members and friends, different ways of handling grief) but that doesn't mean i automatically like the character because "its ok cause trauma.". . trauma is an explanation not an excuse for actions- and considering the actions some of the characters take (stabbing, attempted drowning, bullying a kid and tormenting him for years) they are a bit extreme to just excuse with trauma
so you missed my point and continue to be toxic. you do you bro
how is that toxic? . . are you saying if you got stabbed and the person was like "sorry trauma my sister died." you would just be cool with that? again, i understand why they did stuff, but that doesnt make what they did good, nor does it mean i HAVE to not hate them for what they did.. . im not missing your point, i am disagreeing with it-
Aubrey best
Woah this post got way more attention than i thought.. . Just know u will never change my mind on aubrey! i am as stubborn as i am hateful!!!! >:)). . ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|tableflip). . 
cry about it (Aubrey fortnite dance from Epic Game’s “Fortnite - Battle Royale”)
heh no, i will continue to hate her! >:))
Usually when I hate on Aubrey I get the usual “You are only saying that because you’ve never had to grow up in a broken home!” Which is true, but sometimes they’ll say I’ve never lost someone I loved which is false, my grandfather died.
I love both of them from the bottom of my heart, but if one of them had to be hated, it'd be Aubrey for sure.  . Basil was 12 and witnessed something no child should ever see.  . Aubrey was 16 and had already been engaging in bullying for some time.  . I'm stating it again just in case: I love Aubrey and she doesn't deserve hate either. But I can't understand how people can forgive Aubrey's actions but not Basil's.
So was Aubrey at some point, yet you don't see her doing it
are you really gonna... fight over this? Aubrey wasn't even there and afaik it's never explicitly stated basil alone came up with that idea, its just a vague piece of data iirc.
If Aubrey was there it wouldn't be an staged suicide
Yeah i do love Aubrey but i do consider her to be probably the ine if forgive last. Not to mention people seriously try to defend her bullying and its wild
Aubrey herself admits that she was a jerk for bullying Basil, but even then there are still people who try to justify it
Shes not even just a jerk shes almost homicidal lol
yes! i love aubrey hate sm! f. . ![gif](emote|freeemotespack|tableflip). .  yayay!
Ok but hear me out. Aubrey is cute pink haired alt girl
Aubrey is a ~~cute~~ pink haired alt girl who pushed a boy she tormented for years into a lake- Threatens her former friends with a nail bat and pushes her bully friend group on them- Also she acted completely selfish towards the Mari incident considering she only considered how she felt in the situation, only considering her own grief while not recognising that other people can feel grief- I don't care how young she is, even as a child you can understand the death of a family member will impact the members of the family right?
Fr fuck auby I hate auby grrr she's so violent Omg why do people simp for her I would never ugh
Yeah bro Aubrey sucks, i only like headspace Aubrey because Aubrey in real life is one of the worst characters in the game, she bullies Basil, she steals from him, and she even tries to drown him, i really can't like her if she does such bad things to the best boy, and i don't care if she gets a redemption arc in the end since she still did a lot of bad things
Aubrey deserves forgiveness like basil
This comment made me love Aubrey even more. . Thank you
someone i agree with AND they have a stolas pfp? BASED!!!!
Why do you fantasize about hurting Aubrey so much? Not hating, just curious.
i dont heh i just think the combination of those gifs is funny heh, outside of reddit i dont think about aubrey at all :D
Oh ok then
Well technically in character with Aubrey
I'm an Aubrey stan but Basil is my 4th favorite character, after Aubrey, Sunny and Kel
Outside of aesthetic, why do you like Aubrey?
oh no i just mention aesthetic since its people first reaction to finding out someone hates aubrey, is to be like "omg no cute alt pink hair girl" so i was just getting that putta the way hah.  . I really like your reasonings for liking her and can appreciate that you dont like excuse her outside of headspace behaviour-
Okay, thank you for understanding
News flash: hating Aubrey doesn't make you any better either.
News Flash: IDC!!!
Ok go be even worse than the Aubrey stans lmao
Calm down Liam I'm just trollin
Who said I wasn't also trolling? lol
:Now i'm going to need another Aubrey.
Not wondering why Aubrey's only wearing a shirt? just me?
It's a dress, not a shirt..
It’s a shirt.
Fam got Auby'd

Auby 
its an auby :)
#A U B Y
what the fuck
wait what did they say it got deleted
Get therapy
🙏 all hail Auby
Aubrey was actually the last to sell out. After my friend got all her plushys we started counting down how many Aubrey plushys were left and cheering her on. We felt especially bad sense Aubrey was the only character plushy my friend wasn't intending to get. She was sold out around five minutes before it reached an hour. . . We also figured out how to see how much of something on the OMOCAT shop is left. Just put a ridiculously high number in the order section and try to add to cart. It tells you how many are left. . . As of right now the large "All it costs is your love" Mari sweater has 74 left in stock.
*insert Auby omoji to avoid a chain that could get us in trouble*
Aubrey
Auby
My auby
Yes it is worth it for auby
Its auby!!!
Does this mean the plushies get restocked? I want Aubrey, dang it!
swap the dw omori and aubrey, they are in the wrong position
ill do that tommorow, oopsies on my part
king should be on the opposite color of the tile it's placed on. . vise versa for queen
That implies that on one side Sunny is king and on the other Aubrey is the king 
Aubrey runs over the board, ruining game night AGAIN
Pink hair Aubrey goes upside down
unless dw aubrey and omori switched to opposite gender the board is wrong
Btw on the top omori and aubrey are flipped as they are supposed to be mirrored
Swap either sunny and rw Aubrey or omori and hs Aubrey because the royals are supposed to be in the same columns as the same-gender enemy royals, not arranged for rotational symmetry
||aubrey diff places||
those shoes are not school uniform aubrey
A.auby
Girlie that’s an Aubrey sprite
Omori such a cool game. Aubrey is my favourite character. She is so pretty xD I think I have a thing for pink hair LOL
omori is so cool XDDDDDDD. .  i love aubrey shes my favorite:33
You know, Omori and OFF have a lot in common, I should draw Aubrey and Batter hanging out, why? because both fight with a baseball bat XD lol
I have a lot of comments to share related to these. I don't think there's any way to make a message hidden by default, so ... I'll just let you know this'll be a very long rant you don't need to read. . . - Confusingly, there are a few sprites in the files that have been covered up with a neon pink rectangle, but not actually removed from the game. The weirdest one I've found is titled "MarinaTumor", possibly implying you were literally meant to come across tumors in Humphrey's body in some earlier version of the game. Three spaces in Polly's sprite sheet are also ominously blacked out.. I have absolutely no clue why they went through the effort to censor these, but didn't remove them. . . - It turns out there isn't really a good way to represent a handgun at such a small scale. It seems like I had to choose between making it too oversized and making it hard to recognize as a pistol. I think I ended up somewhere in between. . . - I was listening to one of my old mediocre "70s/80s music" playlists while making "Hero Loading A Gun", and ... the lyric "Henry, don't be so unkind" in Sufragette City by David Bowie was quite fitting. . . - I know the Omori juggling animation is too slow, but the software I used doesn't have any faster frame rate options. I found several "speed up GIF" tools online, but none of those seemed to actually work... . . - if you draw the "kneeling" frame from Sunny's crying sprite in a single color, it apparently looks ... vaguely suggestive. Drawing the lines for the boxers makes it a little less akward, but I couldn't really find a way to fix it completely. . . - similarly to the Frozen Aubrey from my first post, "Kel breaking apart" took a long time to make but didn't actually end up looking very good. . . - One of Aubrey's sprite sheets contains a few random sprites of Kel for some reason. Maybe they were afraid she'd get lonely. . . - you can probably tell which smear frame in "Aubrey accidentally hitting herself" I drew myself instead of copying one from the original sprite. I really struggled to make the curve look smooth. . . - the "daydreaming" request was pretty fun to make, but it also took me a really long time to figure everything out, and the whole effect doesn't work as well as I thought it would. . . - Omori's sprite sheet contains a few sprites of him with smaller eyes looking in various directions. I don't remember seeing these in-game. . . - I couldn't make the framerate in the hugging one much faster than this, so I needed some other suggestion that she's running fast. However, these crudely drawn wind effects wouldn't be visible against a white background and Omori wouldn't be visible against a black one. This grey background isn't very aesthetically pleasing either, and makes it look out-of-place compared to the other sprites in the post, but I couldn't come up with a better option. . . - the sprites of Mari hugging Omori, which I used for reference, feature a random 2x2 flesh-colored patch on the side of her torso. I'd guess it was left over from another sprite, but that doesn't make sense. There are no sprites of her that have flesh-colored pixels there. . . - the sprite sheet "BSBASIL" contains some sort of fusion between his real world and Headspace sprites, and an "Omori" version of him? Once again, I don't remember seeing either of these in-game. . . - ideally, the spider legs should probably move a little as Basil hovers up and down, but I couldn't find a way to do that without making it look even more akward. (I tried making them look more folded-up as he floats upwards, but any decent-looking version I could make would have too much space in between the two leg positions, making the "movement" look terrible. I tried hiding this space with another crude smear frame, but that made it look too fast, like they were supposed to be wings.) . . - the shadow in the last one is off-center. I didn't realize that until just now.
Holy crêpe this is amazing
[this one worked for me]()
I tried that one and it didn't work for me, weirdly. The speed increases on the actual site, but when I view the exported gif in my gallery, it's the exact same speed as the original. (The file does inexplicably become 0.2 MB smaller though)
Wtf?? I tried to download, it's faster when I open it in Files, but slow in the gallery. . How does that even work??
If you want to see something even weirder: if you're using the app, that one runs at the regular speed when you're viewing the post normally, but if you click on it to view it in full screen, it's even slower somehow.
Aubrey missed with the boston basher, must've hurt allot.
It sort of looks like she's swinging around a giant chicken leg, actually
even tho.
Oh well, they're sill nice lol  . How about the Aubrey hitting herself?  . . . That one looks very nice, and it doesn't look pre-made
That's one's a redrawn version of Aubrey's tagging animation in Headspace, when she's hitting an object while facing the "camera".
yeah, but the end had to be done by hand, there's no other sprite like that in the game.
I've done the Aubrey one before irl. Gave me a pretty bad bruise for a few days (these look so fucking epic btw!)
Oh yeah, that seems painful.
Go beat up some blonde twinks in the neighborhood! (Great cosplay btw)

BLUSHING AUBREY BLUSHING AUBREY BLUSHING AUBREY
Doesn’t he find aubrey’s comfortable
Now this, I don't remember. I'll have to check again.
“Aubrey’s bed…”
I remember seeing a post about it sometime, does it just say that in disgust or love? It’s been so long i forgor
My guess would be awe over finally seeing where Aubrey sleeps. Sunny's likely seen all of his friends' beds aside from Aubrey's.
Yeah that’s honestly a pretty good explenation
I should get myself a Aubrey cursor. :O
THE AUBY. . THE AUBY IS REAL

..oOH. . ##THE MIS. . ERYY...
Oooooh the Yasu- *(gunshot)*
Everybody wants to be my eneMYYYYYYYYYYYYYT
To be fair the difference with those is that it's Headspace Aubrey.
I’m aware, but it is all I could find unfortunately. The posts end there, I tried my best. Maybe I’ll look at the twitter acc later if I have time 
Guess I'm Aubrey for now 
0-0
aubrey is juicy (pls laugh)
MAN THIS ART IS VERY BEAUTIFUL AUBREY IS VERY CUTE 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
They're good for Aubrey
>!At that point of the game I already had BiS weapons and armor, so I see little point in them tbh !<

So wonderful. The main reason life sucks for everyone is because no one has their own Basil.,24
So cool,17
Me when I’m by myself vs me when I see my partner,12
Fun fact, basil is only seen consistently smiling while around or talking directly too sunny, as if to try and get confirmation that everything will be okay, it isn’t until the good true ending where sunny smiles to basil in bed that he’s sure everything will be okay. This is also the only time sunny smiles in the real world.,10
He's like the prettiest,6

He’s very openly an intricate character.,31
its either "evil conniving dictator" or "cute helpless femboy that needs to be babied" and i lose my mind,13
As a Basil myself yes. - Basil,6
Modern Socrates and Aristotle,5
I HAD A FULL ON DEBATE WITH A BASIL HATER AT THE MENTAL HOSPITAL I WAS AT THE OTHER DAY AND I COMPLETELY CHANGED HER VIEW ON BASIL >:D,3
It's really fun to talk about Basil with all of the potential ways to dissect his character and his actions. Honestly some of the most fun I've had in the community is discussing Basil's character and things like how he could've been innocent during the incident and what led him to making the choices he did.,3
bagel is best!!!!!!!!!!!!,2
i love bullying him on c.ai,1
yeah you bet,19
to an extent sure, but there's so many hidden details to his character i see almost nobody ever notice. to rattle off some examples:. . 1. in the headspace prologue the scene where he gets knocked down by kel and aubrey foreshadows basil's black and white thinking. . 2. at the hangout spot basil is actually scared of a fishing pole angel is carrying made of a stick and jump rope that resembles mari (angel talks about it at gino's). . 3. in three days left basil deliberately avoids addressing sunny despite subtly staring at him and breaking out into laughter every time they talk, and none of this applies to kel (when you return the album basil only greets kel even though sunny literally hands basil the album and basil tracks sunny with laser accuracy later). . 4. in the evening of 1 day left it's mentioned basil locked his door, but later sunny can open the door meaning basil purposefully unlocked it. . and there's other things i haven't mentioned/discovered too. you can only notice this stuff if you replay the sunny route while paying very close attention to basil which constitutes a very small slice of omori fans,44
yes those are very bothersome. i feel like i see the latter more often nowadays but in some ways bugs me more, like you're draining him of all his depth and interesting thought patterns for the sake of completely surface level cute reading? bleh,8
So weird how fandoms either villainize or infantalize characters like him.,1
...how do you get into a situation where you're having a debate about basil in a mental hospital..... . also i hope you are doing alright now,3
personally i think basil's culpability in the incident is 100% integral to his character but i agree that basil is the most fun to discuss. very multifaceted. and hey, even omocat said basil was the most fun for her to write.,3
you know it!!!,1
Can I join,2
waiter! waiter! more peak please!!,24
I thought that at the hang out spot Basil was freaking out because he was going to commit by jumping in the lake but then the hooligans arrived. I went to watch the scene on YouTube but I really can't see the fishing pole Angel Is holding,4
Your forgetting the part where basil only smiles whilst directly talking to sunny, despite being helped by Kel as well. The only time this pattern is broken is when the two of them talk at the dinner table, which they are talking about sunny during.,3
ok since you asked i will talk about more stuff i noticed:. . 1. at the hangout spot after the hooligans spot, when kel says something like "we just want you to stop messing with basil, whats your deal with him now, we used to be friends, we all used to be" basil stops his crying sprite and backs up. aubrey speaks next but it's not related to basil, meaning what basil backed up from was something kel said there (basil backs up from kel of all people??). . 2. good morning is heavily implied to be basil's song, (it includes phrases he says) and it has the lyric "one more day to spend alone again" so this shows despite the presence of his grandma and polly he still felt alone through the 4 years. . 3. in 3 days left at basil's house, if you try to leave kel is the one who pipes up to stop you.. despite the fact he's fully engrossed in a conversation with polly and basil is the one with 100% of his attention on you fully tracking you? so this implies if kel wasn't there, even though sunny leaving is slow enough for someone to stop him, basil would have just watched sunny leave with unflinching attention without saying a single thing... . 4. a bit off topic but i see people theorize basil was planning on committing suicide even on 3 days left from one of his lines "nice to see youre still around, even if its only for a little while" and him giving the album. but i disagree with this, partly cause i disagree with the line reading (how can things go back to the way they were before if he's dead, and theres other ways to read that line) but mostly because there's a much stronger narrative moment for this to take place, that being the moment aubrey pushes him into the lake.. if you dont speak to basil on 2 days left polly says basil "ran off earlier and hasn't come back yet," and while speaking to him basil looks nervous but agrees when kel mentions "they can always catch up later(after sunny moves)", like he's in denial? then the hooligans surround him and with the fishing pole he's reconfronted by his trauma. then when aubrey pushes him, he very notably loses his flower hair clip, and if you choose to speak to him in bed it's the first time he says his mantra of "there's no way out of this is there." with the symbolism of him losing the flower clip, it's as if he's lost something; something in him has snapped or changed and he isn't what he was before. that line perfectly reflects that, his denial is shattered, no more toxic positivity, he has no choice but to accept sunny is moving away and he'll be "alone" with the truth. so yeah. ..i feel like if aubrey pushing him was so impactful for his state of mind to snap like that, it must have really have been very devastating for him...,21
it's not shown he's holding it, perhaps i should have been more clear: at gino's when the hooligans are talking, that's when he says he's going to bring a fishing pole he made from a "cool stick and a jump rope",7
i don't think i agree with that. he has that smile sprite in instances like kel offering to walk him home, or kel talking about the plants in basil's house, or kel telling him to focus going back to his "happy, carefree self." those aren't focused on sunny, yeah?,1
ohh I didn't notice that. Thanks for the info!,4
You misunderstand, i didn’t say he only ever smiles whilst talking to sunny as if he doesn’t ever smile in general, i said he only smiles whilst talking to sunny, as in he never shows any other face. Even whilst he’s in the midst of a mental breakdown. This could be interpreted as a way to try and get Sunny to smile back, to assure him everything’s going to be ok, but Sunny never does, not until the end of the true route, where Sunny finally smiles back.,3
That's really cool!,16
That's such a good cosplay!,9
Omg, babil!,4
BABIL,5

Took me a minute-,1
Aren't they kids?,0
Oh that’s not,1
it took me a moment to realise😭😭. . . also why does it fit sunny x kel more tho-,-3
Adorable as in what way?,28
What do you mean by that?,9
I see you everywhere, every place, every other place, maybe other Omori subreddits, but i always see you, EVERYWHERE,2
Mari was complimenting Basil's top as in his shirt. Sunny seemed to take it as "top"(normally more dominant, assertive,etc)as in the top in their relationship. I hope this helped explain a bit! I might be a tad off with explaining what a top is in that sense though.,28

it's simple, im everywhee >:),2
you just wasted minutes of your life typing that while I wasted minutes of my life reading that and typing this,5
Omori is 12 and Basil is 12 too??? Also surprised someone actually downvoted me saying that,3
>!Trying to become Mari in real life?!<,3
they're still alive, their last comment was 6 hours ago,3
Basil and Sunny are 16-17 here.,8
>!this seems to be an alternate universe where Mari survives the accident,and Aubrey still has pink hair!<,5
still minors le shrug,0
It’s obviously an AU of this. ,1
Just because they can’t be legally independent they can’t have romantic relationships? They’re almost “legal adults,” they’re not little babies.. . Dude, you should meet real teenagers, they do much other things than “wholesome romance” with their peers. I always see them making out in the halls in my high school.. . Also why do I always see people crying out “They’re kids!” When it’s a homosexual ship but never hear anything like that when it’s heterosexual? 🤨,10
Touche, never went to highschool but sounds about right (online schooling),1
holy shit someone actually backing down on reddit??. . i salute you good sir/madam/gender neutral respect term,2
Its because i barely use reddit,2
fair enough,1
i approve,21

I'm afraid not, this was part of a larger stash of Basil fanart I downloaded with no attributions. Kind of hard to find the original creator of gif...,4

they keep pushing pizza through my mail box,3
Push it back,1
then basil manipulates sunny with blackmail which is how mari really died,40
No worries, he’s just bi ^^,39
Basil is especially vulnerable to sunburn,26
sunny just went in the closet,18
I always found this to be the saddest headcanon. . Basil secretly having a crush on Sunny but being afraid to come out fits a bit too well into the story. . It adds a whole new layer of depth to it all. . It further explains why Sunny moving away is just so traumatic to Basil.,16
Can we get an F for Basil,17
sunny how could you,24
Go kiss him now sunny, you need to, it’s for my ship,27
smh sunny you made basil sad >:c,9

He's so cute I just wanna mbghsnvggh,10
all he did cover up an accidental murder! free him!!!,7
[@napomarusuisan](),7
Unironically he wouldn’t be charged with anything, nor Sunny. I watched the Ace Attorney Omori trial and it seemed to get a lot right.,7
free the femboy he didnt do anything :(,6
Basil becoming L after he gets out of jail,3
Free bro,2
Good.,1
He was actually caught committing arson with Niko.,5
Unless you counted his ahoge, he seems to be about 5’8 in this picture,14
Honestly I think they would both get off scot free due to the circumstances of what happened and their age. No reasonable jury would convict them of something like that when they were that young and when it was an honest accident.,3
I did count his ahoge, that's his antenna after all.,10
His antenna counts :(,4
Sunny had no prior motive and was 12, so yeah. And the only thing Basil could have would be manipulating a crime scene, also at 12.,3
agreed.  i simply will not tolerate another opinion,20
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK!,10
Yes,8
Yes. No one is aloud to have opinions on basil but us! I’ll bring the toaster.,9
Can yall stop it, its not funny anymore and its genuinely annoying. Talking about the war (in my opinion) feels like karma farming.,10
Ditto,2
Its not war if the otherside only has 10 loyal members.,2
brb spamming r/antibasil with this image,2
"Every opinion matters" mfs when someone says they hate Basil. . *And the mfs are very damn fucking right*,2
your so right \^\^,2

We could buuuuuuuuuu- it's way funnier this way.,10
Lowkey just hate that war is a joke, and honestly it wasn’t very funny from the beginning,2

Dude chill out,1
Liking Basil is just a sign of being a great person, not necessarily gay.. . (but yes I happen to be gay),61
me being gay and liking basil: I AM THE ULTIMATE GAY FORCE AND IM GOING TO TURN THE FRIGIN FROGS GAY,21
Basil: exists. . The collective Omori fandom:. . ,5
Cant compute im both what do,4
Just because someone likes Basil doesn't mean they are gay!. (im gay),4
Does being bisexual count,4
Both.,3
Used to be straight. Then babil happened.,1
Left one,1
Hey just because I like basil it doesn't mean I'am gay (YES... in fact I'am gay, but that's not because I like basil),1
The first one because Basil is a nice character and there's nothing in the game hinting towards his sexuality (Mari is still my favourite as is evident by my pfp),1
I second this!!. . And I too happen to be gay haha,22
Fourth and also gay,6
I'm too gay. This isn't a coincidence at this point😅,3
I'd say any flavor of queer counts.,3
Yep.. . There does happen to be a big overlap between gay people and good people.,14
Thirded!,10
I'm seeing a pattern,7
Third and also gay,4
Sixth I am also gay,3
Seventh and very gay.,2
Don’t do this to the poor Babil! He’s too sweet for this!,51
NO GET THOSE BANDS OFF HIS PRECIOUS NOGGIN,29
No, Basil, they gonna blow you!,20
a shame you seemed an honest man,8
Take those off of him INSTANTLY,7
I am going to fucking chop off the hands that are putting those bands on him,7
NO HE'S TOO CUTE,5
Aw his lil face,6
Noooooooooo!!!,5
No, no no no no no no no get those rubber bands off him rn,4
UNHAND HIM RIGHT THIS INSTANT,3
NOT HIS PEA BRAIN!!,3
I don't get it. What's happening?,3
Omg he’s just like me :0,3
захистіть його кавун,3
Too late, this is the only way to treat a war criminal for his past,13
Sorry mate, that's the punishment for such criminals,9
^not that blow,18
I mean, if that's the case then it is a win for Basil,6
And all the fears you hold so dear,4
Oh yeah? we can put it on you instead,1
RUN,8
Its a reference to putting rubber bands on a watermelon until it explodes, and. . . yeah.,4
He's just like you,4
:(. . War crimes can be forgiven!,27
CRIME ??? >!Mari forgave him ! Why don’t you ?!<,5
📸📸,19
Gladly (I am willingly sacrificing myself for no reason),3
Huh? Why should I be running? This seems to be harmless...,3
But I won't,7
That's noble but...FOR a war criminal??? do you- do you even know what he did between 1941-1945? what about the Cuban crisis?,2
Really? You won’t even forgive war crimes on your cake day? Tis supposed to be a happy occasion!,7
A war criminal? You're mistaking him for kel, he was part of the firebombing campaigns of japan, along with the pilot who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and with the cuban crisis, he was sent to negotiate with the Russian dictator to cease missile placements in Cuba,2
My wut,3
you are wrong in one part, he didn't fight on the Japanese front, he fought on the German one and he did many massacres against the German civilian population. He was the one who initiated the Cuban crisis so he can coup the US government by framing them as incompetent and fragile government and he is the one who can achieve the American dream and world peace (which is a lie because his ideology is authoritarian right),1
Cake day! Do you see the cake next to your symbol? That means today is the anniversary of your first day on Reddit!. . Or at least I see the cake symbol. If I’m mistaken, then pardon my faulty assumption of this being your cake day, lol.. . But if I’m not mistaken. Happy cake day~!,6

my only criticism of this is that Basil's helmet seems to be some kind of combination between a stahlhelm and a pickelhaube covered in some sort of brown seal plastic,7
Boys last omori,7
I mean the city Venti protects represents Central Europe like Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland, out of the 173 million people of Central Europe, 82 million are residents of Germany, which makes up almost half of Central Europe's population, additionally, although this is during ww1, Basil comprises the three of the required four traits of being a "certain group of people" that a "certain someone" thinks is the best group, whom also thinks that all germans must possess these traits, the traits being having blonde hair, blue eyes, white skin, and tall stature, though the fourth could be excused due to him just being 16 years of age,5
no,1
,3
I mean, those kind of helmets were worn by german soldiers in the late stages of ww1,3

it's a stahlhelm and pickelhaube hybrid, from what I know, there aren't any stahlhelm pickelhaube hybrids,3
I love the birthday design he looks so lanky and British and silly :3,24

Does omori have an eye opened or is it a tear ?,5
Is this real? I haven’t been able to find a vinyl of it.,3
Irrelevant but cute art,3
I love how close they're always depicted, Basil is so clingy to him its so adorable.,3
Basil is clinging to sunny Aubrey is with Omori hero is with Aubrey (kel aroace supremacy) /hj,2
Sunflower seeds are sold either in the shell or as shelled kernels. Those still in the shell are commonly eaten by cracking them with your teeth, then spitting out the shell — which shouldn’t be eaten. These seeds are a particularly popular snack at baseball games and other outdoor sports games.,38
HeroMari and Sunburn both get a lot of art and stuff, it's really Suntan and Kelbrey that misses out,1
its opened, hes probably watching sunny,5
check the omori twitter,2
It is very relevant that our Basil is cuddling up with Sunnny,5
Good... bot?,15
I actually disagree. In terms of post game stuff, man sunburn gets nothing,4
No I was saying that my statement was irrelevant,5
It just extends the list.,1
Oh lol, my bad,3
It's okay :),2
Sunny: …just… wear it…,31
It’s a nice outfit, that’s what it is, Basil. It suits you! Although you’re so cute anything suits you.,22
The based kind, Basil, the based kind,30
Who is he cosplaying?,7

AHHH,2

Hey ! That's not the artwork I was thinking of, but it's cool nonetheless!,1

Sunny: niiice~,1
Anything?,8
I remember seeing Basil in a "certain" outfit in r/cursedomori,6
You wanna see it?,4
George Washington,17
Venti,13
Venti from Genshin,6
🤨,18
Yes please,4
I wanna see it too,3
Always.,2
I also wanna see it,2
yess,2
Yes.,2
why does babil suffer so much, man? just wanna cuddle him and let him talk about his problems, but NO >:(,65
Omg the perspective on this is amazing!,22
I think you could draw basil's something on the end of the wall (the one leading to his grandma's room) symbolizing his fear for his grandma's lost...since he loves his grandma so much, the something needs to be big and intimidating,14
I'm sad now 😢,11
[@nofuno0004](),9
he must suffer even though i think he deserves better.,7
Happy Basil!,11
bagel!,9
this cult is the best one i've been in thank you all for posting wholesome basil and making me happy :\],6

My day has been brightened, my soul has lifted,  i am now in a constant state of happiness, thank you basil you have made me truly happy.,4

HE'S SO CUTE MY HEART IS LITERALLY MELTING AUUUGGHHH!,10
little bean, protect him at all costs😭😭🎀,8
HA! The original was posted on r/mildfemboys!!,5
But why is he so cute? Why did omocat get up one day and say "hey I'll make the cutest character ever" and proceeded to break all laws of physics,3
Aww I love him 🥹,2
I would,0
yea.. . ...aaand...?,6
Idk just found it funny,7
Cute! Love it!,16
Link: ,14
Thank you for reminding me of Rowan’s existence,12
So cuuute !!!,11
Ah, Rowan. Basically a proto-Basil with a fucked-up personality like mine. He earns an adorable place next to Basil.,10
They’d make a pretty adorable duo, as long as Sunny is around to try and calm down Basil from dealing with Rowan’s antics!,5
lisaB?,4
evil basil p much,3
Now draw them teleporting bread.. . ,4
Shouldn’t this be marked (oc)?,2
I’m desperate to understand the beef between Rowan and Sunny.. . (I literally know nothing about Rowan other than that he’s beta-Basil),1
I wonder how different the OMORI fandom would be if Rowan wasn't scrapped...,1
Flower is proto-basil, Rowan is beta-basil,9
Rowan,1
Evil Basil: >!I will not coverup my Best Friend's murder of his own sister and I will instead report him to the authorities !<,5
,4
Rowan was The beta version of Basil, it's more of an AU,10
oc means original content on reddit,1
True, I suppose if we argue semantics, my terminology is slightly off. Apologies for making such a grave and unforgivable error on the Internet, I will now proceed to seppuku.,5
:(,1
Ah makes sense,7
You literally had to look one message up to see someone else already corrected me (also generally oc means original character),1
they said it was an au instead which doesnt correct you. oc does generally mean original character, but not on reddit which is why I was letting you know. no need to be so defensive,1
“Rowan was a beta version of basil” corrects the idea that they’re an oc. and oc also means original character on Reddit too, it’s literally a tag.,1
[@nofuno0004](),11
What a coincidence, i also woke up with a cold this morning,10

He is adorable,1
r/BeatMeToIt,2
Yup, I agree. Out of the 1000 basil images in my folder, their work is the best. [Link to their Twitter](),1
Wait hold on 1000 image folder can you link that or put that somewhere please sorry,1
Hello, I know your account is deleted and that I'm 3 months late, but I can't post it anywhere because most of them don't have the artist credited and it'd be a disservice to them. Sorry.. . Also it's up to 2000 images now.,1
YES BASIL,14
Next: convertible,11
YES!YES!!YES!!!,9
it happens :/,6
how the fuck is this already moldy,2
i turn aubrey i ot car,6
Aw sunny is too shy.. come on you can do it !,31
I wonder how much overlap this sub has with Sunflower fans. I'd be shocked if most in here aren't sunflower fans,10
[,8
Honestly it seems that most Basil fans like Sunflower. Obviously not all, but definitely a lot ,4
The average, common outdoor variety of sunflower can grow to between 8 and 12 feet in the space of 5 or 6 months. This makes them one of the fastest growing plants.,4
Yeah like it seems like Sunny fans are kinda all over the place with ships but like Basil and Sunflower fans overlap a lot. Which makes sense cause its really only Basils big ship that makes any sense at all,3
Basil fans understand him and his love for Sunny :)),2
we have been given fuel to be sustained by,26
Same day as my friend,8
this is the first time i've seen them draw basil with bags under his eyes in official art since his in-game portaits... we are eating good basil nation. . . EDIT: actually on second thought that might just be the artstyle portraying the bottom of the eye like with the RW merch art... it's so over....,8
BAGEL YAY!!!!!,12
I need cosplay now want cosplay now I need to own these clothes now now now I love Basil,6
Me and Basil are so close, my birthday is 2 days after his,5
made my entire week. why is he so cute?,5
is your friend looking like a femboy?,1
idk it turned out pretty cool imo , kinda looks like hellmari.,100
Honestly i feel like this would fit into the game,59
This looks like something out of Blackspace,51
holy shit it's HELLBASIL,47
Still a cute Basil.,24
All we need is a little bit of blood and there you have it a cutesy creepypasta,10
What did you do,8
Reminds me of the fly 1986,4
What kinda eldritch abomination have you made,5

Oh that’s gore… that’s gore of my comfort character…,2
canon,2
ever so slightly gang💀🙏,2
thats amazing,2
I dont see anything wrong with him he is just taking a really deep breath,2
that would actually look pretty sick in the game like for an extra/secret blackspace level🤔🤔,2
If you pet his neck, it gets longer like the doggo from Undertale.,23
Good. Soon his neck will get long enough to wrap me like a boa constrictor. Death by getting suffocated by Basil is the way I’d like to go.,11
He looks so eepy and peaceful... Now I wanna cozy up in my cardigan and get some tea...,20
Basedsil wearing chill robes at home,9
[@nofuno0004](),6
lol, I got the cardigan a few hours ago and its so comfy...I cant stop wearing it,3
He looks so cute even in lego,33
I definetly believe that LEGO would make a new hair piece for him because of his uniqueness. I'm sorry to say this but with this hairstyle he doesn't look like Basil. Maybe you can model a new piece (with his crown modeld into it).. . Everything else looks beautiful and peak, well done😀👌🏻,18
Is that a barbed wire flower crown,13
He's so silly, even when blockified...,9
No matter the medium, Basil will always be the cutiest of patooties ☺️~!,5
A basil has fallen into the lake in faraway town!,3
he’s so cute even in lego formmmmmmmmm aaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,1
Have you tried just giving him clippers or shears?,1
is that a bunch of metal wire in the shape of a bat?,1
thank you so much! he is a part of a lego ideas project i made that released today, i can reply with a link to it if you'd like to support it :),16
i 100% agree, however i created this design for lego ideas and they do not allow new molds. i asked a few people and most said that the hairpiece i chose is the best fit out of the ones currently available.,10
yeah, closest i could use without creating a full-on new piece,11
indeed,6
I’m broke as shit but I would love to support it,4
Than I suggest you to try these 5 hair pieces I found more "Basil looking" like.. . Piece number:. . -88283. . -25378. . -25409. . -61183. . -92746. . . These are just suggestions but I'd like to see if they fit more then the current.,7
,6
not a fan of the first two and the last piece is one i already used for kel, but i could try the others out :) i'll send a photo when i am done,6
Thank you very much for the effort and time😊. I'm also praying that LEGO will inplement it as a set🙏🏻. (Tbh I didn't expect that you didn't like the second option cause I thought it looked from all of those as the best one for him, maybe that is just me💀),4
it's just due to personal preference, i just don't really like that hairpiece in general which is why i said that. thank you very much for the feedback though, comments like yours have helped shape the project into how it is today :) i think i've linked it in another comment on this post so you can go support it if you'd like <3,5
I already saw it (supported already) and got onto every platform and omori servers to deliver the news to help this project. I'm very thankfull of the fact you made these.😃🤙🏻,3
thank you very much :) i'm very thankful that you've supported it! i also might do some more omori lego stuff later on, even if not in the context of a lego ideas project, just for fun,4
The only person I would want to get shot by :3,21
He could shoot me 🥰,29
I wish I had my own shotgun so Basil and I could have a duel and then brutally make out,17
YIPPIEE,7
I'm pretty sure it was a hunting rifle, not a shotgun.,6
poor sunny imagine basil just snaps and fucking shoots him,5
Ha! You've activated my trap card! MAGIC CYLINDER,5
would finally get his revenge,4
I need to get me a Basil with a gun.,4
Awww how cuteee :3 such a cutie patootie :3 he’s so sweet :3,3
The violence has escalated,3
That's not a shotgun...,4
WHAT,15
What.... He's 16?!?!!,-2
I wouldn’t be mad 🥰,14
Dude not everyone who likes Basil is a 45 year old man,5
Funnily enough considering the time frame Omori is set in Basil is probably 40-ish now so…,6
It is still a cause for concern,1
This is just too perfect lol.,10
Absolute king.,8
did you do this art yourself cause dang it’s really good,4

Why is he holding hands with snuuy? Is he gay???,23
he so adorable, i love him sm,12
that expression on the top-left panel of the second page is certainly a choice,8
Oh god that basil smug,6
God I love this art style!,4
dear god..,3
I don’t like anyone in the manga really... . You tell what the artist is by how they draw them…..,3
artist/source?. wanna learn the way they draw eyes,2
Yeees ! Babil !!!,1
I love the Babil Bagel Basil, he is the best boy.,1
Real,1
Yes,5
Yes,1
i think they're cute but they def don't look like 16 y/o😭 i try not to let it ruin the manga for me but the artist is hard to ignore...,2
wait OMORI IS GETTING MANGA?!?,3
Honest, direct, and clear. I love it.,4
Because he loves basil,3
He’s like 13….,0
They just look very sexualized. ESPECIALLY in the second picture.  Honestly the manga doesn’t match the games art style and doesn’t look anything like how I pictured them to.,3
yeahh😭 first chapter is out,4
He’s like 13,2
yeahh most of the manga redraws i've seen on twitter are way better than the original artstyle. i also wish they would've gone with the game's style instead.. like when sunny opens the door for kel he looks like he just got out of pre-school while kel looks giant. why did they do sunny like that😭 i wouldn't say the general artstyle looks sexualized, it's just the artist behind the manga who makes me go oh..this is uh, kinda weird. especially since sunny and basil look a lot like the pairing the artist used in a very problematic comic. gives me the biggest ick,3
Are you insulting his culture for not being "woke" enough? Thats literally bullyin bruh,1
Omg. that is so adorable.,8
why is babil crying :((,4

Is basil someone who deserves nothing but pain?,3
How do I get a basil plush,2
Whats your opinion on watermelons,2
No, he is the most hetrosexual manly man I've ever seen. He's going to join the military when he's 18, no doubt,25
not he’s not a femboy.  idk if he’s gay cause the game doesn’t comment on it but ye,4
With those rugburns on his hands from messing around with a jump rope, no,13
Pain,6
No, a bagel is something I actually like, he is not,4
Yes, he's a terrible character and I feel like his character is very dull, he's also a crybaby,4
*Navy ;),14
So yes he's a bagel, but you don't like bagels?,2
Correct.,2
No, military because he is the most hetrosexual man I've seen.,14

Happy cake day 🍰,3
Happy cake day 🎂,2
Fairly sure that both artists were on Twitter. The first one is basically the same thing as here, a repost.,3
in a good way or in a bad way?,4
I mean, he is in the outline of the sister, so maybe that's why,2
now that you made me think about it, I kinda hope that at least one artist does it,4
why?,2
tbh i lost interest in tcoaal but the pfp was cool so i used it :3,15
Thanks 😎,3

NO WHAT,2

No.,1
I'm not gay,-8
I'll bother with it in 10 hours.,2
Ohhhh... That's what you meant, ok 👍,4
Do not say lies snuuy,4
Yeah, no, found nothing. I can recall seeing it myself on Twitter back then, but there is no trace of it. Other than your reposts of it, apparently.,1
Nice art tho,1
Wdym lies? I'm NOT gay,0
Yes,3
“My Ray of Sunshine🌻” reminds you something?,2

Someone in the original post said basil isn't a femboy,3
Eww mildfemboys the transphobic sub,1
Ew that's the transphobic sub,1
Omori ppl trying not to call children femboys challenge (impossible),-1
Because he isn't,6
Well he is not one but he has some feminine attributes,1
I'm guessing you're saying that because of Bridget and to be fair, they only user older Bridget, who was a femboy instead of modern Bridget, which is a woman,3
go away coomer,1
Halo 3,1
*some*?,2
They used art with trans flags made by a trans person and edited it to be all femboy flags,3
a lot,2
Oh.,2
cry more loser,-3
Just remembered they edited another trans flag fanart to say im a G.uy I.n R.eal L.ife,1

Really? No one says "hola" at 7:44 pm because of the law order it and it is a little bit ago and it was like a lot of people are in the same boat I can do to help you with this one is a lot of fun and we can talk about the election results do you understand what I.,2

Sorry my man,1
Good bot,2
mmmmmmyes basil,5
basil: too perfect to be picked,2
I do kinda wanna see the original list. I wanna know what the final melon is like,2
Why would you even think of picking them,2
The last one was not ripe,1
basil: do not pick this watermelon, you will regret it, if you want to then good luck figuring out how, 1000 people have tried but they couldn’t do a thing. why the hell would you even want to? the 735th person to tey and pick the basil watermelon was named “router”. he did everything he could to try and even lay a scratch on basil, and he was known for making a tiny scratch. let’s just say he celebrated too early and router was never seen again,2
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life and if i had the money to buy that sht, i definitely would,10
I'm not jealous, I'm not jealous, I'm not jealous😵‍💫,6

Tournesol is the French name for Sunflower, the literal translation is ‘Turned Sun’, in line with the plants’ ability for solar tracking, sounds fitting. The Spanish word is El Girasolis.,3

A compound in sunflower seeds blocks an enzyme that causes blood vessels to constrict. As a result, it may help your blood vessels relax, lowering your blood pressure. The magnesium in sunflower seeds helps reduce blood pressure levels as well.,16
that's actually a pretty cool fact,7

So gay… so cute 🥹,9
This is absolutely wonderful ,9
[@tokkooyaku](),6
awww its so cute!!!,8
this is the kind of manliness I strive to achieve,8
You may not like it, but this is peak male performance.,3
For those who are unaware this artist is known for drawing mpreg basil,131
I don't get it,40
without *the implications* this is actually really cute,40
Ok i could have understood 1 but THREE? THREE CHILDREN? HOLY THEY GAVE IN-,12
ermm why is Mpreg implications a bad thing,33
fate of most good arists,6
I don't know the lore behind this, but it looks cute,11
I for one accept mpreg basil with open arms,10
i'm going to cry,3
Aww….oh no….,5
Y'know, it wouldn't have cost anything to simply not post this. It's still free, but you made my day actively worse by making me look at it.,5
I mean the artist could headcanon Basil as a trans male who didn't physically transition but It's still weird because they're minors,4
That one is old asf already 💀,2
Oh...THAT artist...,2
Who's the artist?,3
I don't get it, really. It might be because I've seen A LOT of things on the internet or just without a reason but mpreg isn't really that big of a deal to me idk.,3
Well is someone gonna explain it?,1
Awwww nooo0o,1
You can draw pretty much whatever you’d like in my opinion, but some of that stuff should be kept to yourself 😭,1
For anyone wondering, the implication is that those are Hero and Basils kids…,-3
Why is kel black,-9
Oh god, that exists,45
OH GOD NO WHY,14
good! there's nothing wrong with that \^\^,10
How do I kill my ability to read,4
based,6
. . wtf,2
:(,1
Male pregnancy, presumably with kel,37
Me neither,7
What are the implication???,5
kinkshaming,14
right? yall gotta stop hating,7
the artist is known for drawing r@pe comics of bail, their username is hornydaddy,5
WAIT IS THAT THE GUY WHO DREW THE R* DRAWINGS OF BASIL?,4
Basil got pregnant, judging by the skin colour, by kel,12
Kel, which is only slightly better,11
You’re saying that as if it surprises you it’s the internet of course that exists /j,8
Is it bad that I don't even flinch to that? Like its gross, but I've seen WAY worse on Ao3.. . Whatever, the art is still cute.,62
If it's with Kel, that would explain why Sora exists,4
I would say keep it that way but it's too late now,1
Mpreg.,13
Thanks for the name. Seems talented.,5
yes,3
Did the artist say it’s Kel? Less cursed that way but the hair reminds me more of Hero,-2
Yeah like I still find it cute,13
Depends on your age maybe. I'm in my mid 20s, have been chronically online for a while. I have seen the prime of Homestuck and Undertale hype. Aka I've seen some shit so mpreg is pretty tame. . . . I guess people who are losing their minds over this are young teens.,6
I'm dumb & ignorant could you explain? 😭,1
Imo this is a much "lighter" case of mpreg, >!i had the displeasure of witnessing one involving Mari once!<. . The art style is traumatic for me now 💀,3
Sora is the main protagonist of Kingdom Hearts. When you look at his sprite, he looks like a fusion of Kel and Basil. He has blue eyes and a similar hairstyle to Basil and he has brown hair and tanned skin like Kel.,5
Understandable, don't tell me Mari was the impregnator 😭,5
Ty, I knew him from smash ultimate but didn't really see the resemblance,2
*Bingo.*. . >!The last panel was their kid looking at a sunflower and saying "it's beautiful, looks like my mommy!"!<. . ... Bad day to have eyes, i tell you.,5
If you switch Kel's hairstyle with Basil's, give him blue eyes and put the edited Kel next to any HUD icon of Sora (2D drawn preferably), you can sort of see it,2
Lmao, wait Sunny's an uncle 😭,4
Yeah I kinda see it now. . Have a good day :],1
I did NOT think about that 😭😭 i wonder how Sunny felt. . Mari: You're an uncle now Sunny!!. . Sunny: (Damn she and Hero had a kid already?). . She and Basil showing up nine months later with their kid:,4
Enjoy yours!!,2
Oh shit right it's *basil*, god that'd definitely scar me 😁,4
>from soft. . Holy shit! It's the developers of the hit series Dark souls!,31

Basil is hard now,20
Why does this look like every high schooler girl romance manga?,4
Nice art! Would fit right in with an omori swap au.,1
dont forget elder rung!,7
Held out hope that they popped up again.... . But no. Apparently 1-2 people there know something about Yui, and that's it, the person is gone, apparently.,8
,14
Boobborne,6
What happened?,4
Talked shit about another artist (eggsoupery)'s art, and made a racist joke with friends in a dm that got leaked (used complete black when filling in kel's skin in a wip) and people bullied them to the point of suicide over it. Last i heard they got admitted to some sort of suicide prevention ward in Russia, which are notorious for being terrible. While yeah, what she did was wrong, she was only 14. Im forever mad at omoritwt for doing that to her when the whole theme of omori is forgiveness, and she was a child that made a mistake,4
Radio silence. All i really know in comprehension.,2
I too dont wanna get drafted,10
Thanks,4
i know what im doing today then,4
Like I said before, eating the corpse is most efficient,3

Reminds me of >!that one part of black space where you smash watermelons with Basil and then suddenly his head blows up. I was having so much fun too :(!<,25
The best way to help Basil is to let go of headspace,13

babil is never going to beat the femboy allegations is he,5
Literally him,1
Who?,1
My user name confirms it bc I’m also a basil lover,1
Venti looks so cute in this fanart.,1
Sunflower seeds are technically the fruits of the sunflower plant (Helianthus annuus). The seeds are harvested from the plant’s large flower heads, which can measure more than 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. A single sunflower head may contain up to 2,000 seeds,11
Someone get MatPat!,1
Basil and Venti are not feminine, they are the peak actualization of traditional civilized Greco-Roman masculinity, in fact every man on earth should aspire to look like Basil and Venti,1
we need someone to draw HS Basil in Venti's clothes,4
sadly,1
Literally Him?. . ,1
what differentiates an edible seed to a fruit?,4
Retired,2
why not go more traditional and go cave man mode?,1
There are two things we need drawn.. . 1: HS Basil and Venti switching outfits.. . 2: Basil and Venti kissing.. . I don’t make the rules.,2
I know a fanart like that exists. Venti in omori's artstyle and basil in genshin's style and clothes. I don't know where it is, brb,1
Unfortunately that commenter is unable to give an answer due to them being a bot.,2
Darn, I forgor,1
Number 2 is a no no,0
Basil is either 12 or 16, and Venti is like 36000 years old or something ,0
and everyone keeps saying that AI is gonna take over the world, when it can't even reply to my question,4
besides he quit the game before he even got to the real world,2
he may look like a teenager, but he's actually a 3 million year old dragon!,1

It's from the Okamoto kitchen event. [Here]() or [here]() (but you will scroll down a bit),3
Thanks!,2
Basil putting his immense gardening skills to good use I see.,25
Basil would be either the best smoking buddy or the worst and I can't for the life of me say which if is,13
thank you for this amazingness so i don’t have to go on twitter to look at it, thank you for your service and you are loved,6
Noooooo Basil dont hurt your precious lungs,3
This pleases me inexplicably,2
Basil you’re too young to smoke <:(,2
Growing those "herbs",8
Oh, you're extremely welcome! My bagel stash is made up of art from all corners of the internet (Reddit, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, even 4chan) and curated regularly using Duplicate Checkers. I do plan on posting here with the rate of around one per day.,3
My thoughts too,3
Honestly u 100% right,7
I'll never understand how one logs onto 4chan without instantly regretting it,2
One does not. I sustain permanent damage to my psyche each time; every Basil fanart is captioned with the most unfathomably disgusting statements you can imagine.. But for the art itself? I'm willing to make sacrifices in the pursuit of a complete bagel collection.,3
We won't let this sacrifice go to waste,2
Not enough money, and I cannot stand seeing him sad,33
Never in a million years,24
No.. . ,17
No.,12
Nah,11
No. Come here Basil, we're going for ice cream.,9

I’d do it for KitKat bar,9
While the DW variant kind of reappears after suffering, it wouldn't be that worth it.,3
The fucks a “filipino pesos”? Of course I’m not going to murder the Babil for something I didn’t even know existed until now.,3
So I get to beat him AND get money???,2
thats enough for 6 mints ill take it,1

Finally, the true reason humans evolved hands has been discovered! It was in preparation for Him! Our task on this planet complete, humanity is now free to explore the cosmos, and maybe one day, find Basil for real!,10
It is. He’s such a goober <3,4
The 5th reason: to tirelessly defend the Basil from all who wish to hurt him :3,3

YESSSSS TYSM,1

You should eventually make these for alternate versions of every point at which something bad happens to Basil, I love them so far,19
I know everyone here loves basil, including me but nobody ever gives ANY love to stranger! It's kinda insane because he is my favorite character and just because he is black doesn't mean you should not pay attention to him! He is still basil after all.,7
Epic,4
No matter what there's aways something trying to kill headspace Basil. He just never can catch a break!,2
Good content,2
Shadow realm basil,6
Yeah the stranger is a very interesting character to me. But i almost kinda lump him in with Basil. I just cant tell if hes actually Basil ot just taking the form of Basil cause i think he says some things that only Basil would know but idk if Basil is actually controlling him,2
Stranger's pretty cool.,1
Something is going to have a phobia of guns after this.,12
hes done with aubrey's bullying,7
no matter what fandom, all the cinnamon rolls need to have guns,7

Watermelon Gun Boy, cute + good job,7
Why is bagel American school child?,7
I taught Basil how to be based. I taught him how to be a ... ehem.... . #WHOLESOME WAR CRIMINAL :D. . His guns have the ability to grow entire trees and plants from their victims, since each bullet has multiple seeds and a compact ultrafertiliser made out of pvz2 plant food.. . When the bullet reaches the body, the plants quickly root in the victim's entire body, progressively absorbing the victim's vital force while they are still alive. . . And from the blood of the victim, roses bloom. So lovely, so beautiful. Not cursed at all :),5
Awww I love him!. . I'll snuggle the watermelon >:3,3
I’m being threatened by a watermelon,3
Why does the watermelon have a gun??,5

im so lonely in here, can you imagine me a boyfriend? QQ,7
I literally have Basil syndrome, whenever I walk into my room and see my three basil plushes (headspace, faraway, stranger) its an immediate neuron activation and I get just as happy as when I first got them and played with them, and I talk to them like telling them how my day was, stupid stuff like that, but its a genuine immediate happy switch that gets flipped in my brain.,3

Thanks, I feel like I really needed that. . Before anyone opens it while eating, it's literally a photo of human feces,12
Well thanks I feel unsafe,5
one of the rites of passage for being an omori fan is knowing what oyasumi means,2
good,3
i didnt know that-- i just know a tiny bit of japanese,1
same,1
Now I should question you or just be worried,2
well now that u know what oyasumi means, u can officially call urself an omori fan,1
both,1
no i already knew, i meant i didnt know u must know what oyasumi means to = omori fan,1
Ok well you good?,1
nope,1

I need to know, is there a subreddit for sunflower?,2
your welcome,8
omori be looking like a snack,7
The sunflower seeds you eat are encased in inedible black-and-white striped shells, also called hulls. Those used for extracting sunflower oil have solid black shells.,1
This is not what I needed to know, but thank you for this information,2
“Uhh uhm uh uhhh uuhm”. -Basil,108

"This is going straight to my photo album",36
He’d be worried for the first month or so that he’s locked in our temple. But eventually he’ll submit.,32
Might hang us on a tree,30
Erm, what the fruit snack,26
I think Basil came to visit once, was very confused,7
I think he'd need a lot more flowers.,6
ascend to his higher godly form,7
tbh its kind of weird, and some people take it a little too far, but all in all it's just nice to be accepted for who i am and shown so much love ><,23
Elect himself as the God Emperor of the Basil Cult.. . (Warhammer 40k reference, lol),6
If I could send an image I would because I have the perfect one.,2
But he at least has a cult of devoted worshippers to help praise him and get him through that terror :3. . (granted, that’ll probably just make him more nervous…But if we worship him enough we’ll get him used to praise and force him into loving himself, lol :3),28
*Snap* this is going to my cringe compilation!,5
And it's just a photo of thousands of people bowing down to him💀,4
No our Basil wouldn’t do that,26
Why do u have the Sunny tag Basil,9
“RELEASE MEEEEE!!! I GOTTA ADD THIS TO MY. . . *CRIIIINGE COMPILATIOOOOOON!!!* “,1
He already hanged mari,18
Gay,10

We all know it's not a coincidence. Like, come on, just look at them, they're so gay,41
It’s actually the artists that do Omori stuff that make everyone blush all the time.  But I still will believe that Bagel had a crush on Snuuy!!!,17
Yes because Basil is a very pretty boy and Sunny is gay,17
I love bagel ♥️,7
omg babil,7
Prepare for a rant because I find a few things about sunny and basils relationship neat, omori smiles twice, when he’s happy/ecstatic/manic, and then he can smile again you release energy during the animation. and in the real world sunny literally cannot become happy, the only time we see a physical sunny smile is when he’s in the hospital on the true ending, when he smiles to basil.                                              . Additionally their chemistry is kinda insane; they met each other through Aubrey, a mutual friend, so you’d expect Aubrey to be the intermediate between them, but no, they’re surprisingly even more bonded than sunny and kel by age 12. in terms of real world evidence, it’s damning, basil is a nervous wreck who somehow came up with the idea to frame Sunny’s murder as a suicide and then actually helped him set it up, he didn’t tell anyone about it, even Aubrey who he knew before sunny. when sunny vandalized basils photos instead of telling his friends the truth of it he took the blame and went through four years of bullying for it, and when he heard Sunny’s moving away he had a panic attack in his own house and begged sunny not to leave. In the end all basil has ever done has been to make Sunny’s life better, something he believed as he took a pair of sheers to Sunny’s eye.                            . in headspace it’s even more obvious, as four five cycles of resetting, basil has found the truth and been erased, and for five cycles of resetting omori has explored the entire world to find him, and during the Chef minigame in sweethearts castle it’s shown that sunny remembers the recipe for strawberry cake because it was the type that basil ate for his birthday. In less misinterpret-able instances there are only three photos of sunny and basil together in the photo album, and in all three of them they’re less than a foot apart. And in the omori calendars 12 photos sunny and basil are together in 10 of them, with the only two being when sunny is sleeping against his sister and when he’s playing violin. (Also in the comics they hold hands),7
BABIL,3
There ain’t no way that’s a coincidence, like.. C’mon… Jst look at them and tell me they’re not gay (you can‘t),5
It's because we're so gay for each other ////,3
and chapter 1 of the manga came out during pride month,1
He has gay facial structure,1
whats the original image for this 333:,1
It’s more than a coincidence.,1
This is true but omocat still always draws Bagel next to Snuny and in a lot of pics they're holding hands so its still canon,10

Whenever my keyboard needs replacement I plan on matching it, and any basil related plushie released by Omocat will be a fine addition to my collection.,7
Lmao I’ve thought about it from time to time.,7
You're on an omori sub, a character specific omori sub.. . You have no right to speak.,11
You do not deserve that flair.,8
Lmao I do have a problem, all y’all aught to be civil about this lol, don’t downvote Gdmrhotshot’s post for speaking his mind.,2
But he’s my fav char,-2
Btw I like omori. . But with the game it is (keep in mind it is not any game). . I can’t help but like…. React a certain way to people doing that. . It’s fine if u do it but I like laughing at it,-4
Yeah I completely understand, I’m not gonna lie it just started out as plushies and then more plushies, and then I needed to replace my mouse and I already needed to replace my mousepad for a long time so I got an Omori desk mat and my mouse replacement had color options that included mint so I figured it’d match the mat (not to mention mint is my favorite color). Truthfully it wasn’t supposed to be an Omori inspired desk, but its evolved into the creation it is today lol.,2

He's gonna take you back to the past-,1
How scandalous,6
Don't you dare Shinji the Sunny,3
That's what I imagine Sunny and Basil would do . . Other than plant flowers together,5
Awwwww I love sunflower so fucking much,9
Everyone does . . *(Except Sunburn shippers)*,4
Idek why people ship sunburn. It's not cannon and would probably be unhealthy,5
And do they expect Aubrey to forgive Sunny after the good ending . . Tbh honest I don't think she will hurt Sunny . . But Basil on the other hand...,5
RIGHT?! And people call Sunflower toxic but praise sunburn. It makes no sense,3
Shed try I think. And Hero and Kel would have to stop her,4
They're just homophobic 😒. . Probably not but I can't find a valid excuse to dislike them,2
Nah Hero would be pushing Sunny down the stairs . . Kel would become the next Basil witnessing the murder of two of his friends,4
You'd be surprised (or not) at how many sunflower haters are just straight up homophobic,5
Becoming a donut lmao,4
I thought like 90% of omori players were gay anyway,3
Sunflower seeds are especially high in vitamin E and selenium. These function as antioxidants to protect your body’s cells against free radical damage, which plays a role in several chronic diseases.,2
Pretty much,2
Thank you TheSunflowerSeeds, very cool,1
Well I can tell from your pfp lol,2
Sure am lol,2
One of us! One of us! One of us!,2
Woohoo!,2
I ran out of things to say T~T,2
Me too >> Nice talking to you though :)),2
Yeah you too!,2
aubrey’s bullying wasn’t the reason of Basil’s suicide though,57
Don't think those 5 hours were enough either!,16
Justice for the silly little flower boy we all worship,14
I think this should be marked as a spoiler,33
Doesn't feel like a fair comparison since basil dying is during a non canon ending. Mari dying is the game's premise,14
>!Basil didn't commit suicide because of Aubrey's bullying, at least not as an even remotely significant factor. Basil kills himself because of the emotional distress from learning that Sunny is moving away. (and some other reasons)!<. . >!The main driving force of both the game and Basil's trauma is the Something behind him. Basil inflicted immense lifelong trauma on himself and his friends to protect Sunny. Learning that his best friend (and potential lover) he protected with said trauma is suddenly moving away tears him apart.!<. . >!Between his already existing trauma (incl. absent parents), Sunny moving away, and the implied death of his grandmother, Aubrey's bullying is a drop in the metaphorical bucket.!<,9
really pisses me off that iirc Aubrey’s only time acknowledging and apologising for all the torment she put Basil through is when he’s killed himself and she’s feeling bad about herself and apologising over it.. . Basil was already going through a lot of heavy shit as is but Aubrey most definitely tipped a lot of it over the edge compared to how it could’ve been even if it was all a big misunderstanding at the end of the day with the photo album. she should’ve apologised in the good ending, or even before the game ended and at the sleepover before everyone goes to bed (I can’t remember if Basil was actually awake during that so someone correct me if I’m wrong, it’s been over a year and I can’t remember if he was awake when everyone else was or if he only woke up to then fight with Sunny/die after everyone else went to sleep) and it pisses off that I’d have to turn to hoping that fanfictions post good ending include some form of apology.,4
if sunny never ruined the photo album aubrey would never have abandoned him or made the entire town bully him. it might not have been THE reason behind the suicide but it made his life and abandonment issues a million times worse,39
Not the main reason, but definitely a contributing factor,39
yeah, my 125+ hours in the game say otherwise as well,10
theres nothing that explicitly says basil dying cant also be a canon ending 🤓 it's up to what you choose in the game,5
The game hints Basil is going to >!commit suicide.!~. . >!When he says goodbye to you in grandma's bedroom, it is written so that you think Basil knows that Sunny is moving away (a fair assumption to make, as Kel already knew) only to pull the rug from under you when it is revealed during the dinner that he didn't know. But by that point you probably don't remember that one off line and won't give a second thought as to why he gave you his photo album then.!<. . >!The photo album is described in both the inventory descriptions and in dialogue multiple tomes, by multiple characters as Basil's most prized possession. It's not something you part with easily and is also one of the common warning signs of someone planning a suicide.!<. . >!I've also heard a suggestion that Basil might've been in the old hangout spot on the second day because that's where he was planning to do it. Not exactly sold on that, but it does make sense. Perhaps he chickened out and they stumbled upon him. I strongly feel that the catalyst to finally do it was grandmother's death as that was the last of his support structure, the last person he cared about (sans Sunny).!<,3
im becoming increasingly aware that i might be misunderstanding basil's character and just projecting my own trauma onto him,10
there's a super half-assed 5 second long scene on 1 day left where aubrey apologizes to basil (basil doesnt respond and is probably asleep). . if i made the game i'd have sunny interrupt aubrey's explanation about the bullying at the treehouse and blurt out that he ruined the album after learning just how badly he failed basil by doing that. idk i feel like that'd give basil more closure and also show sunny slowly starting to get more comfortable with confessing things (which would get a lot more relevant later on).. . plus you could argue that him confessing to that first and aubrey apologizing to basil would work as a "fake ending" to the story to trick first-time players (like maybe the photo album was the thing sunny's been feeling guilty over all this time and things will finally start to heal- wait a minute sunny did WHAT to mari!?),5
Aubrey didn't abandon him, she asked him to hang out and mistook as the album's marker scribbles as basil's doing so she started calling him a creep and things like that. And the reason basil killed himself is most likely cause of his something he wanted to get rid of with his garden shears (like how he did to sunnys eye),23
To be fair, it took me 60 hours, several playthroughs, and a lot of distress to learn this much about him.,8
by bullying basil and getting the entire town on it (we also dont know the extent of the bullying and if he had a mental breakdown from them surrounding him at the lake we can only imagine how horrible it really was), aubrey effectively abandoned him as her friend and killed his chances of finding other people to connect to in the town as well,9
You know it's incredibly sad to remember that Aubrey was Basil's FIRST friend and vice versa before they met the four,16
It's not the whole town, it's only her group, and that wasn't a mental breakdown either, you witness an actual mental breakdown at night when sunny enters basil's room. The bullying seems to be more that she's just intimidating him rather than causing actual harm.,5
kim literally attacks basil in her first scene lol, not to mention the literal nail bat aubrey carries with her,8
Kim only acts mean to basil, aubrey never used her nailbat, not even in battle, she only uses it in sunny's daydreams. She carries the nailbat for intimidating her foes.,4
i thought kim knocked basil over though?,6
She told him to go talk with aubrey by himself,3
And then knocked Basil over with her scooter,2
OMG so cute !!!,9

Whereas springing a kiss without making sure of consent is perhaps not the wisest move, the friend’s reaction reveals a deep-seated bigotry that makes him not proper friend material, unless he can be taught to grow and change as a person.,52

who the fuck keeps posting basil to that subreddit. . oh it’s you,15
Source: ,3
no hate twords op but I fucking hate mildfemboys (they are known for transphobia and people will post trans women calling them femboys and anyone who points out it's a women and not a guy is banned),2
Babil!,1
"mild",1
HOW DO YOU KNOW??? HOW DO YOU KNOOWW??,2
The thing is that most femboy characters get called trans women no matter how much the source material, and the character himself, explicitly say the character is a boy.. . So ofc people will insist they're mtf because they just don't respect femboys. The mods ban people who try to invalidate femboys because, well, it's a femboy-positive sub.,2
I'm talking about characters that are canonically trans,1
Which ones, then?,1
Bridget is colonically trans female,1
I responded to a post OP made on mildfemboys saying the exact same thing and got downvoted. Kinda ironic OP complains about turning femboy characters trans considering they have posted memes saying canonical trans characters are actually femboys.,1
It grows back, anyways. And basil taste good on food! Infinite basil glitch:,2
Oh no now we gotta cut the same amount on the other side so mari doesnt notice!,1
XDDDD,2
The comments on this is hilarious,2
Of course the account is owned by an Aubrey fan,13
As a person in r/omori, I can confirm this is FALSE. . Actually I see basil fans everywhere, one time I made a meme and ppl were like “bro is wrong, basil and Mari are some of the most liked”. . The only people who are like this to basil are people who forget sunny is also wrong, by that logic sunny should also be there, but he isn’t cos he’s the protag and ohhhh fans can never hate him,20
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. . \*grabs gun\*,9
Give credit to artist: [,4
[,1
they also kin Basil so...,8
You also have Aubrey fans trying to defend what she has done by victim blaming Basil . . I've seen people who do that which is weird,3
Because those people are dumb, luckily that only takes up a portion and everyone else knows that’s not the case,3
,1
This is the people being talked about,1
(This is all a joke Omocat never tweeted this),122
If that were true, it just wouldn't make sense given how many Sunflower hints Omocat themselves have added to the game.,48
Sunflower and sunburn are really cool i ship them both and theyre equally as adorable i giggle and kick my feet every time i see cute ship art of them,2
Aubrey love note sequence,0
Based omocat,-10
mr. Information is very displeased with what you just did to his beloved wife,57
I agree. Especially with how Omocat has treated the ship in like merch drops. Way more than Sunburn, its def her faborite ship.,27
This is deliberate imho. Whether it's cynical or genuine desire for the game to be more inclusive, there is definitely a lot left unsaid in order to have the Sunny be interpreted in a way that resonates with you, be it gay, straight, bi or even trans.,19
many people will disagree with you,1
r/fuckoff,5
I’ve seen yaoi-bait often in stories. Making it look like characters are gay, only for them to both get in confirmed straight relationships to avoid offending old-fashioned assholes.. . But Sunflower definitely doesn’t feel like yaoi-bait. It feels like Omocat intends it as a valid ship. But leaves the gate open for others, once again to avoid offending old-fashioned people and avoid alienating people who ship something else.,22
ik that's not the real omocat lmao,1
😔😔😔,4
Sunflower kernels are one of the finest sources of the B-complex group of vitamins. They are very good sources of B-complex vitamins such as niacin, folic acid, thiamin (vitamin B1), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), pantothenic acid, and riboflavin.,11
And it's really clever about it because the game talks about Sunny having a crush on Aubrey in a way that will seems almost like an explicit text to a straight person, as Sunny visibly blushes when Basil suggests it, which seems to confirm it.. . But queer players will remembers all those times their parents, teachers and friends suggested they like a girl they know and how many times they've blushed at times like that, while keeping the truth to themselves.,3
r/redemptionarc,8
dropping some headcanon on how Basil rizzed Sunny,11
thank you,5
what they really mean: i hate people with bpd and schizophrenia and other unromanticizable mental disorders <3,20
He's right,9
And this is why, fellas, you never tell god his trope sucks,6
What trope is basil?,4
"NOOOO! THEIR MENTAL DISORDER HAS TO BE QUIRKY AND SILLY SO I CAN INFANTALIZE THEM!",13
Schizophrenic seems like a harsh diagnosis considering his only arguable symptom is hallucinations. (Arguable because some people theorize that the something’s in those scenes were sunny’s perception of basils actions.),1
What they really mean: I've come across alot of terrible executions of the trope, that made the trope terrible; Basil is one of the poor executions to me.,0
are you talking about God or the person searching in google? a pipe bomb may show up in your mailbox depending on your answer...,9
Funny. Bring up incest trope and the world flips over.,-1
I don't think those are the kind of people who hate Basil tbh. I feel like it's more the toxic types who hate anyone shy because they think they're weak or something, maybe jealous of open expression of feelings. And/o the types who think there can't be anything positive from a disorder or being different ever and people should just stop "thinking they're special"..,3
God ofc. Basil is my best friend after all,12
it's bigotry from hate either way you slice it. and trust me, practically all the basil hate i see is ableism targeted against the bpd-coded/schizophrenia-coded aspects of his character, him defying traditional masculine gender roles just makes him an easier target to them,1
I'm not really specifically talking about people who hate Basil specifically, the people who usually hate Basil hate him because of how he handled the incident from what I hear. This is moreso referring to a wider spread stereotype where many people try to sensationalize certain disorders and make them something "quirky and silly".,1
*defuses nuclear reactor i was charging* oh i see Good. if only i caught on i was having the pleasure of speaking to Snunny from Omorbi earlier...,10

WHO-,1
🤭🤭🤭,2
he cute,76
Maybe it’s just me, but I had this overwhelming urge to protect him. It just sorta upset me that even through such sudden circumstances, Basil was hurt in a way he could never truly recover from. Then being bullied by Aubrey and her friends, it just made me feel bad cause he’s such a kind character,57
I thought his story was incredibly interesting and told in an interesting way. Also his relationship with Sunny is both cute AF and fascinating,26
His reliability and cuteness. Plus, he likes flowers, and I like flowers too!,27
He cute. . He huggable. . He probably like hug. . I like hug. . I like bagil :>,25
Personally because he is a reliable person with an interesting background and endured 4 years of suffering to keep his best friend's secret (also he is cute),13
Back when I finished watching a playthrough, I was genuinely scared of >!how BASIL was acting the day of the recital. I mean, BASIL hanged MARI without thinking about calling an ambulance, asking for help from anywhere or thinking about how SUNNY would feel about BASIL's decision. Why? And his denial just made me feel uneasy about his RW version since.!< However, there was a point where someone explained why he did what he did by explaining how the traumatic event caused him to literally modify the memory of >! SUNNY pushing MARI and see it as SUNNY's SOMETHING, which is very weird, and much more questionable than the original question, but it makes a lot of sense.!<. . BASIL wouldn't be so convinced that >!SUNNY didn't do it if his memory said otherwise, and also explains why he chose to hang her -- because he knew everyone would hate SUNNY for what he did, so framing a suicide was the only way to protect SUNNY and still have him around. But what he didn't consider was SUNNY blaming himself for MARI's death, becoming a shut-in, and ***LEAVING BASIL BEHIND TO SUFFER WITH HIS GULT. FOR FOUR YEARS.*** This is what leads BASIL to break down in front of SUNNY, asking him how he could leave him behind after everything BASIL did for him (The murder, the photo bullying, everything BASIL did to protect SUNNY) -- because he meant so much to the latter that he did everything to stay best friends.!<. . ...After realizing all of this, BASIL became my favorite character, because I felt like I understood him. That's probably why many hate him... because they don't understand him.. . (What I just wrote may not be 100% accurate to the actual comment because it was really long and it's been a while since I last read said comment. But point is, this whole thing made my view of mental illness clearer.). . Thanks for coming to my TEDTalk. :),13
Lol I relate to him a bit too much,8
the relatability if his character in general,7
He and I both canonically stabbed a bitch,7
he baby with good lore,7
everything,6
His sprites are so cute i wanna hug him. . He would probably give me flowers even if i were a stranger :3,4
he just like me fr,5
He bail,3
Cute an relatable,3
I like him because he’s cute and relatable and I feel like if he were real I’d be his best friend because we’re both anxious introverts. I also like his plant knowledge, it’s fun. And I just love how well his character was built.,3
He's nice,2
"oh that's a cool girl she's kind of sensitive but- oh it's a guy cool" . "oh wow mentally unstable same!". "WAIT WHAT HE DO TO >!MARI??????!<,2
He has such an interesting backstory and there's so many little details about him I can theorize about and also he's just cute and fun to draw :),2
Relatability!. . …,2
Bagel,2
he's so real,2
Mentioning anything here feels like copy-paste.. . So, making it simple: He's kind of cute, **not** a terrible person, has depth, and like u/Smoid mentioned, an urge to protect 'im.. . Great, i committed copy-paste.,2
Cute character with depth and he has great character development/backstory. Also very relatable,2
He’s nervous and he screams a lot . . Just like me fr,2
He's a little baby and my brain tells me that I love and want to protect babies,2
Well... I did get slightly influenced before playing the game by a Basil fan on Discord... But as soon as I saw him, I was just like "Child!" and he became my favorite,2
He’s basil,2
HE CUTE AND SMOL <333 also i relate to him in a lot of ways,2
Love his role as a tragic character, plus the controversy surrounding him makes him the character you really gotta think the most about. Would you find it in your heart to forgive someone who did something as horrible as what basil did, even when they are not 100% there? Initially, i thought no, but over time i felt like forgiveness was the only option that made sense.,2
I find him oddly relatable in faraway segments and sometimes relatable I. Headspace ones. Also,it’s the bagel what’s not to like.,2
Who said i don't hate myself,2
I like his design and his personality in the rw is almost frustratingly similar to mine, so he's relatable.,2
Relatability,2
babil scrunkly. . babil cute. . babil kind. . babil like flowers. . babil huggable. . babil relatable. . babil best boi. . babil best. . on another note though, every time i look at him i want to hug him and protect him. he's a really deep character when you properly delve into it.,2
I liked the scrunkly at first, then I was like “oh damn he’s just like me Fr”,2
The homosexual^^tm^^ theory.,2
he cute and I like toxic yaoi and he brings it in the story which is good cuz I need to fujo out,1
An alcoholic drink,1
idk I just became a basil fan without explanation,1
Probably because I relate to him…. . oh wait, that’s bad, isn’t it?,1
The main reason 99.1% Basil's fans like him,27
Same,3
The "urge to protect the gardener" trait is shared by a few other people, so... you are not alone on that, i assume?,5
literally me,1
I find it pretty cute and hilarious that he is named after a plant and he likes to take care of plants.,10
Everyone likes Bagel.. . Praise the sacred huggable flower boy!,10
That was actually so cool to read. What you said is 100% true and understanding him is the reason Basil is my favorite as well. Such a tragic character. Seeing his life turning around, becoming a former shell of himself after the trauma he faced despite his good intentions.,4
That's a cute thought. He is the type of guy to distribute flowers to the entire town.,1
🥯,2
You should be punished for committing such a heinous crime! **The copy-paste.**,2
We all must safeguard the mighty Basil.,1
OMG BASIL!1!!1,1
He's also just a great character overall, there's more to it but I really don't feel like typing a lot rn,2
Holy babil. This is such a mood to read.. . Babil is too pure and perfect and must be protected at all costs. . Best boi.,2

absolutely not alone on this piss off, what would you do in the same circumstances?,3
Praise the sun! (Basil) . . \ |+| /,5
Thank you :D and you're absolutely right, he's definitely high up on Top 10 Tragic Characters, especially when you look at >!OMORI's NEUTRAL ENDINGS.!< It hurts me like hell every time I think about >!BASIL after SUNNY commits suicide!<. To just have everything he sacrificed, all the pain and hits he took for SUNNY >!just suddenly become in vain!<. I really can't imagine BASIL ever living a proper life in any non-good ending, >!assuming he lives at all.!<,4
Where did my knees go?,2
YESS,2
Well said,2
I agree. I remember my first game playthrough I accidently >!got the Omori neutral ending when the friend group reunited and had sleepover at Basil's. I didn't know what to do when Sunny woke up so I returned to Sunny's home and slept, and when I returned to Basil's I found him committed suicide!< which made me very shocked. The pain and suffering he had to go through all of his life. I heard that Basil had anxiety even before joining the friend group and thought of himself as a burden. He knows how to >!tie a noose!< which is very dark and says something.. . So him >!witnessing Mari's death, getting abandoned and left alone again, getting bullied by his childhood friend (Aubrey) and her gang for something he didn't do. All of that in 4 years, and then getting thrown in a lake and the breaking point when his grandma passed away.!< I am surprised how he even endured most of this.,3
You are responsible for the predictable repercussions of your actions.,2

The idea that basil just keeps growing his hair out till the day he dies and sunny just has the same haircut he’s had since he was 11 is hilarious to me.,52
Old Basil would probably be the chillest grandfather in the world, though I don't think I'm ready to see Basil that late in his life :(,27
Twink death is a myth.,29
Need him,21
very sweet,14
even 60 years later, he is still such a babygirl,11
“When I was your age, my friend did a terrible thing, and while my action wasn’t the best, I had to help him, it put a strain on my life for years, and I was bullied too, I almost made a horrible mistake, but luckily, I decided not to go through with it, forgive myself and move past mistakes”,11

well i mean it sounds a bit mature for his age but i like it,36
I’d expect this voice for real world basil, 16 year olds have deep voices (hell, my voice was so deep it made someone mistake me for an adult at 12). . Headspace basil… I’ll still keep my uwu twink headcanon for his voice,25
[Basil from faraway logs](),12
Natsuki Hanae is a great VA and I like most of his roles but tbh I’m not feeling this one.,8
I headcanoned he’d sound more like tails not gonna lie,8
It's more like a "narration" so if they were to make an actual anime adaptation they will probably change the voice.,4
i was not expecting tanjiro basil,3
This reminded me of the meme from like 2 years ago where basils head cannon voice sounded like a shitty anime dub,2
i think this voice works for faraway basil perfectly.,2
I don’t care what is considered canon, if it doesn’t impact the story, headcanon can replace it.,2
This sounds perfect for him,2
I expected something a little higher but it's good,1
I love him i cant breathe,1
Literally my hc-,1
This and this video for HS Basil: . ,1
I’d assume this is supposed to be RW Basil rather than HS Basil. Especially since he’s talking to Sunny and not Omori.,10

Ask Basil,35
Did maybe some bugs or infection get to it? If light levels and water were fine, I'd check for signs of infection if I were you. Stuff like yellowing leaves, black spots, or small spores. From the looks of it, and don't take this as a diagnosis because I'm not a florist or botanist, but that might be Basil downy mildew from the looks of it. It spreads by water and is a water mold instead of a standard fungus or infection. By the way, you might be a bit lost, this is a subreddit for the character from OMORI, named Basil, but you aren't too far off!,33
Context: We went for a weekend vacation and we found it like this when we came back. It seems like it got I'll somehow. Does anyone know what it is, how to procent it, or how to take care of it?,17
Because he's currently out of stock :(,14
r/gardening is the correct sub to post this,12
It's time to drink water.,9
r/lostredditors,4
this is the second time someone thought this was for literal basil (from all the posts i’ve seen at least),9
Another one,4
Basil is not a long lived plant anyways, as soon as it starts flowering you have about 1 month left to it. You can extend its life by cutting the flowers but it's natural for it to die at the end of summer (at least my local variety, in chile),1
he doesn’t like you,1
Herbs need the sun to live...,23
Yes! There were yellow leaves and black spots. The light level should be fine because we have a grow light. I think you are into something.. . . I didn't realize this was not the correct subreddit, thank you!,29
r/lostredditors,32
For a bit of clarification, this is a subreddit for a video game character named Basil, not the actual plant basil lol,16
No problem! And don't worry about it, plenty of people come here looking for help with their basil plants all the time.,12

Yes,6
Alright listen . . Sunny and Aubrey should be protection . . Aubrey is good with blunt objects and Sunny is good with sharp objects . . If Hero and Kel were in here too Hero should be the one making plans since he's the smartest one in the group and Kel is good for defence too. . Basil is like player 222 he's just here to be adorable,6

God Please post all of these. Write a bot to do it if it takes too long,1
I plan on posting the full folder as soon as it is done. Until then, I'll try to make do with sporadic uploads. My main issue is that most of the art doesn't have credit attached. Due to my strong personal convictions, I will almost never post something if I cannot find the original artist.. . Additionally, the art is a mixed bag to say the least. Some are ship art with different characters, some are pencil drawings, etc.   . I plan on fully curating it, making sure there are no duplicates, and adding an artist to every single file. All this while the collection continually grows.. . One day, it'll be done.,3
get someone to help you, im sure flowerbois fan would be glad,2

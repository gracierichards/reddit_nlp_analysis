Not even anti-basil this is just a fact,5
i wanna smash basils head in with hector,6
turn him into a 4x4 rubiks cube and do a parity alg,11
Yeah because we need him to suffer as he dies. Like a blender is just a one-and-done, turn it on & he’s dead within seconds.,7
Mortar and pestle,5
There is?,5
Hell yeah!,3
I feel like it would be better to make him suffer for a long period of time,6
Why is that the kinda thing you would just find in Basils house?,3
~~hanged drawn and quartered~~,2
literally anyone and anything >>>>> stinky little shit piss boy basil,10
TRUE this should be accepted as fact,4

i wish hero left basil to drown,6
Best Ending,6
i wish he died in all endings,4
\*the better version,7
(this is just a joke i do rlly like basil) because stranger solos him obviously 🙄,2
Based,5
Oh nah,-1
facts,5
people on this sub hate him so much and I just wonder why,0
🤭🤭🤭🤭,3
idk. maybe it’s because they think he’s too clingy or something, that’s my best guess at least,5
thats a bit of overraction but maybe,1
probably. but redditors are just insane like that ngl,3
yeah, I kinda forgot it was reddit :'),1

God I love Hero.,1
Wut,1
Hero is cool. He makes this world a better place by merely existing. Yea. Hero is pretty frikin dilly billy darlinginingin cool dude and pal and our lord and saviour and amigo and other stuff like that. Yep.,1

Jokes on you he died for our sins,3
based off of my "BURN THE REMI" comment i believe,3
[No save the basil from fire >:C](),2
Save the basil,-5
he will come back to life after three days you asshole he's basil, basil's a god.,1
Burn the bagel,1
Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire.,3
basil haters\*,1
yes thank you for the idea,3
You want to drown Basil? I knew you had it in you!,4
SAVE HIM!!!,2
**no u**,4
he isnt drowning, the water is below his legs hes perfectly fine, it was just to put out the fire, by now basil has already been saved via boat, and is now sleeping soundly in his home,3
No,1
I'll burn his house then,3
i just don't think he should be around sunny given how sunny subconsciously hated and blamed him for everything. sunny and basil aren't healthy alone nor together and even after they go to therapy/get counseling i don't think it would be good for them to be close. after all the main hallucinations sunny had were related to seeing his sister hanging. sunny wouldn't have gone to jail for shoving his sister, he didn't intend to kill her and he was 12. however basil decided to hang her rather than get anyone to even TRY to help her. as someone who's been in traumatic situations the first response was always to reduce casualties/deaths. that meant getting help even if someone i loved might get it trouble. not to mention he also ripped out sunnys fucking eye. could you personally forgive someone for hanging your sister and blinding one of your eyes? not to mention hero changed his entire career path and threw away his.dreama thinking he missed the signs and was a bad boyfriend, that maybe if he had tried harder to look for what was wrong shed still be alive. kel lost his older brother. aubrey stayed alone and abandoned in a neglectful home. if basil had just let sunny take the fall the friend group may have been torn apart but everyone would have lived a better life. im not mad he didnt know the perfect response to a traumatizing situation but he took one of the worst fucking routes possible. the regret he feels and tbe strain it has on his mental health is deserved by the way he kept quiet for so long for his own selfish reasons. HE didnt want sunny to get in trouble. sunny probably wouldnt have cared to take responsibility for his actions given the grief he felt from it. just my own opinion and thoughts personally tho.,11
HERO equipped BLENDER,10
MUCHO TEXTO,6

it's Grammarly's fault (an app's fault), not me,3

Boom. Roasted.,5
Ah hell nah 😭😭😭,3
IT HIT RIGHT IN THE HEART,2
I can blend headspace basil all I want because he's not real,2
I would pay to hurt Basil,2
I don’t like the idea of hurting anyone but I would love a million dollars.,1
death is the only way,14
We shall commit genocide,9
Arson,8
Spam on their subreddit to the point where it's not even a probasil subreddit anymore. Or on a good day just tell them to keep their retarded ass members in check,8
I can join you, as long as you can offer up more money than the basil cult,6
While i have joined r/probasil i only tolerate basil cos while he is integral to the story he is a whiny annoying teenager who can't get over not seeing his emo twink partner in crime,3
We do a little omori,4
u/router should add at least one rule so we can report them.,4
Spread the word of the anti Basil sub so that more people can join and post anti Basil posts lol,8
Im sorry that my fellow pro basil people are spamming your subreddit, i feel it would be beneficial if we agreed to disagree on the matter of liking basil,2
im playing both sides, so i always come out on top,1
cry about it,-4
Hey, could someone give some context here? Are basil fans just annoying or is this one of those subreddits hating on something for no reason?,0
Cry about it, I’ll drink your tears out of a cup,-11

Give in the basil.,-3
Respect their opinion as chads,-3

Antibasil crusaders,2
basil must die and the basil cult is retaliating,6
ill drink your blood out of your skull,12
The cult hasn’t offered me any money yet, I’m only taking offers until 12 am so yeah,7
The what?? Some serious clarity as to what the hell this cult is.,0
Nah after looking, both of you are weird. Though one gives off those monkey-hate video vibes and the other just really likes basil.,0
I fucked your mom shitlips,-10
10 bucks and a banana,3
so it goes,4
Untrue, it's scientifically proven that Basil fans don't get any pussy or dick,8
It's not much but the cult hasn't made any deals so, get the blender,7
No!,1

Such a dubious and diabolical creature! Such a wicked  creature should be put behind bars and given the most confining cells the jailhouse has to offer. . . Truly a dreadful sight 😔,9

Basil fans gonna think this is too graphic lmao,12

Almost had us in the first quarter, ngl.,13

Man, you must really hate Basil, huh. I didn’t even know there were that many ways to kill someone. Hating a character is fine and all, but Jesus you have a lot of hate for him. You good?,3
This aged like milk,2
This sounds… familiar. 🤨,1
Ahoudou billahi mina shaitani rajim , ME TOO AHAH,1

The cursed thing is that I could probably post this to pro basil subs and I don't think anyone would really object.,9
He's just balancing out the positive he gets, that's all.,6
Also fax,2
True.,4
Indeed.,5
facts,3
it's a very bad way of torturing basil, since he doesn't survive for that long. maybe we should try waterboarding him,2
There isn’t just a blender. There’s also some watermelon.,1

watermelon juice,3
Hell yea,3
[Saved basil from blender, he is very angry with you](),2
Fucn you too,1
Why would you commit such an action to bagel.,1
perfect.,1
Who said there's only one blender,2
the watermelon juice obtained afterwards is very profitable to sell,3
he is already outside your house with sharp garden sheers, just try to put him into another blender,2
Okay you got me there,3
my fake decoy house that's actually a giant blender you mean?,2
hes not at your decoy house, hes at your actual one,2
my actual house is basil's house :),1
thats why hes outside it with sharp garden sheers, hes trimming the bushes,2
I have a knife,2
he will literally pull a villager in smash bros and grow a tree in your face when you go to attack him then he'll stab you,2
I have armor made from picnic blankets so no.,1
he has a back up plan glock,2
Picnic Blanket Armor Mk. III is nearly invincible except for the s██i█s,1
well it cant cover your face, or else you cant see then basil can take advantage of it's weakness,2
Behold the transparent picnic blanket,1
i see, however little do you know, basil has the power of depression and anxiety which makes him get a rapid fire gun that will pierce through your armor,2
I can just open a few presents and get an emotional advantage over him,1
fair, but by the time the first present is opened he already kicked you down a flight of stairs,2
That's where the other key feature of Picnic Blanket Armor Mk. III comes in. Unlike Mk. II, it features three layers of life jam, providing sufficient jam reserves for 143 revivals. Using the stairs would only give me access to Basil's mind and give him additional trauma points that make him vulnerable to present spam,1
however little do you know that picnic armor MkIII has been in maris picnic basket this entire time,2
That's the whole point. Mari's picnic blanket is invincible and is the thing preventing her from dying.,1
however, she has it not you,2
The properties of the Kel boson allow for objects and their properties to be recreated.,1
well only kel has it and only he can use such a power and he cant recreate such a power such as the picnic blanket mark III,2
The Kel Boson has been created at the OMOR particle accelerator and its abilities have been manipulated by feeding one such boson with the text "THIS KEL BOSON IS STABLE". This stable boson has been used to create many others and a replica picnic blanket has been fabricated by a kel boson facility. Its properties have been recreated in an OMOR facility and incorporated into wearable armor, combined with life jam technology. New innovations include the KANON warp drive and the highly unstable KELTRANUKE, currently predicted to be capable of creating a sphere of total destruction expanding at lightspeed. The assembling of the first OMORBINATOR has begun. The revolution has started. It's OMORBIN' time and my new forces will rise to secure the OMORI community from the extremist Cult of Basil, the newly summoned TRUE BASIL they just summoned and the rise of OMOLI, predicted by a famous prophet to happen on 31 August,1
There will be absolute hell of basils, and the life jam technology is all in sunny's head, doomsday where only basil shall fill the sky and thousands of basils shall attack, there is. no. escape.,2
If all else fails, I will release many KELTRANUKES to start purging the universe and flee,1
basi nukes are more powerful, they shall fill the sky and surround the earth in plants,2
lmao i have blenders,1
the god of all basils larger than human comprehension will crush them,2
thank you for your info, will plan accordinglh,0
I would help you in this discussion but its 1 am for me.. All im saying is that you're doing great.,1
you cannot, he is larger than any form of human comprehension, you wont even be able to fathom his strength and size there is no, planning accordingly,2
thank you for the moral support,2
the KELTRANUKE literally creates a rapidly expanding unstoppable sphere of death,1
Glad to help.,1
you underestimate god basils strength, for he is above your comprehension, he is divine and cannot be destroyed by mere mortals,2
who said i'm mortal,1
basil, he is the god of this universe to him you're mortal you are not above his level he can smite you,2
it's ALWAYS omorbin' time.,1
but basil shall overcome the omorbin,2
the OMOR army is too strong,1
Nah bro basil is literally god, omor army is merely just mortals,2
Perfect,3
Let’s goo,2

MY EYESSSS,3
The sheer amount of fear that entered my body once basil got grabbed was immense,1
The Great Basil Treaty, 20 August 2022. . &#x200B;. . We have overcome our differences and we are finally united. We might be too late. A famous prophet warned me that on 31 August 2022, OMOLI will rise and attack the OMORI community. Maybe only together may we survive. . . &#x200B;. . Pass this message onto r/probasil,12
thanks, but wars are fun.,2
no more wars,3
As an antibasil maybe this treaty is the right thing to do,1
i am grateful that the 2 parties can finally come to some sort of agreement.,1
yeah i love getting death threats totally fun,1
NO NO NO. . IF THE HATE BAND DESISTS I WILL MAKE MY OWN WAHAHAHA,-2
no more wars,3
IF I LOSE A WAR I CAN START ANOTHER ONE. (just wihout the grave sick insults),-2
if you start a war, people are going to tell me to kill myself for making jokes again,2
no wars. . just peace,2
Inevitably, there will be some extremists on both sides that do not agree.,1

Waterboarding,6
Slowly getting tortured by poking his eyes with needles, skinning him alive and then slowly burning him as he dies a horrible and painful death,4
skin him and pour disinfectant on him.,4
watermelon,4
death,7
Pushed down the stairs, mentally tortured, water boarding, lots of bone breaking, Dehydration, Starvation, Scalping, Sleep deprivation, tooth pulling, acid attack, bamboo torture, dismemberment, hamstringing, half hanging, boiled, foot roasting, kneecapping, and then hung.. . . If he’s strong enough he should live it’s not that bad smh,6
Poison, slow and painful.,3
Death,2
Punched to Minecraft,2
>!Stab both of his eyes, push him down the stairs, and then finally hang him on the tree and frame it on himself !<. . But in nicer terms, just dangle him off the hospital balcony for 48 hours upside down while listening to My Time on a loop.,2

nice opinion btw,1
Damn this person got banned. It was probably basil fault tbh.,1
I want to light hid hair on fire and watch him slowly burn.,1
the character from omori,1
thank god I thought you meant the plant for a second then we would have had problems,2
it was the meme that sparked the outbreak. we also use elevators and watermelon chopping too. . also r/probasiI for some interesting stuff,4
ah, true,3
no thats too dangerous it will attack our men too,3
LMAOOOOOOO,2
I have to report this information to the basil cult.,-1
the O M O R B I N A T O R S are our last chance,3
it's omorbin' time,3
too late,4
Drink his blood!,1
that s a good idea but what can we hate if basil stop existing,2
That would create a time paradox. . If Basil doesn't exist, then he never gives Sunny the idea to h*ng Mari. . If Mari doesn't get h*nged, Sunny calls 911 like a sane person would (hopefully). . If Sunny deviates from the plot of Omori, then time itself collapses and existence itself dies. . >!Let's do it!<,1
Rosa the bitch,3
Meat tenderizer.,9
Cut off his limbs like he’s a Necromorph,8
Put him in a locked room with a sandpaper floor on a conveyor belt. This will force him to keep moving till he passes out, and he will get woken up by the sandpaper grinding against his flesh. This cycle repeats till he dies of blood loss or something days later,4
Rusty pipe,3
Spare him 🥹,-5

I’m starting to see why basil had no friends until Aubrey felt bad and invited him 😐,5
Basil stinky,5
Fax 🤯😆🤣🫡🥳🤢😤🍉🍉,1
I didn't, I care for it excessively by throwing it violently against a wall,2
great idea, noted,1
either way its a win for me i like watermelon and i also like pesto,6
Even better?,4
That's why I just use a +UltraCoubterRicoshot,2
There’s a reason it’s labeled “NSFW.” But seriously, the game already has Basil getting destroyed in the game, so this isn’t that far off from what actually happens. >!Minus the gun. I didn’t see any guns in Omori lmao!<,11
An hated character exists in every community,7
i mean i like basil but he does kinda >!Get his head sliced off by an elevator!< ingame so this subreddit isn't too far off,6
boi he cut someones eye and hang someone that s pretty reasonable(i don t hate basil i like eating melons),4
He deserved it.,3
There are two posts of slightly gorey images, you're exaggerating,3
The pleasure of hurting others,3
There's only like 2 posts,2
nah cuz seriously ☠️ i dont like basil but this is too far,1
Yeah but it's like fighting fire with more fire,2
Wait doesn't Aubrey hit Kel and Sunny with a nail bat,1
yes we need a rocket launcher,4
ye,1
Okay I'll be right back,2
Lol,1
Pick up the dust and feed it to hector, so basil could have been somewhat useful.,4
Yess basil,3
Oh no! Anyway…,3
watermelon juice,8
Pesto :D,3
Basil pesto,2
6 digit code or food sauce?,0
Someone already got it right it was... pesto ,5
The ones you put in food,3
Correct! +1 clam,3
Correct! Here is a clip of someone making it ;) ,2
Food sauce,2
You mean this? :,4

Correct i love pesto (sauce that is literally made out of basil),3
You have our support.,1
Now im curious why your friend hates the plant,6
she hates all italian things,6
mama mia,2
Understandable,1
Eye candy right there 🤭,3
Ah.. so this is how I found out this subreddit exists 💀,1
It will be difficult, but let’s hope we win the war. I don’t know which character’s winning though.,2
Bulgars are genuinely dumb.,1
THE PLOT THICKENS,5
I honestly don't know how to feel about the fact that I'm getting invested in this saga. How did Basil get his regeneration abilities? What's the "cleansing of sin"? Is this a reference to some sort of r/antibasil lore I'm just not caught up on?,4
good question. it isnt antibasil lore, though.,1
Ah ok. Was just wondering cuz it seems like the main OMORI sub has lore so I was wondering if that was the case here lmao,2
. more. will make more death basil, but some other stuff i got here.,1
bcz HOW DARE YOU MAKE GORE OF A FICTIONAL CHARACTER THAT ALREADY HAS GORE IN THE GAME 😭😭😭😭,7
Because Basil's deaths in the game have a reason and an explanation inside of Sunny's head, but this is mad weird and yall are making drawings and talking about murdering a kid, and thats way more explicit than the few pixels we see in the game,-5
they do what the game did before, if it was an actual person, I should have trusted you, but all they did was to draw a fictional character getting killed, not an actual human being.,6
Yeah, drawing someone getting murdered, with the only reasong being that you dislike them, no matter if theyre fictional or not, is concerning.,-7
"with the only reasong being that you dislike them, no matter if theyre fictional or not, is concerning". . &#x200B;. . Actually, I don't care if they're drawing a fictional character getting killed UNLESS somebody draws an actual person in real life getting killed, I don't hate nor love it, although I was laughing so hard when basil keeps getting killed/dying, it's so funny to me.,8

Master of disguise.,1
Meet the spy,1
No, he identifies sexually as a disaster,7
It's not confirmed, but a lot of people headcanon him as gay.,7
Unknown, but unlikely,1
yes,0
This is the most accurate answer.,3
I personally haedcanon him as bi,1
I personally headcanon him as he gets no pussy nor cock,3
Accurate description of Basil.,1
Likely because of a lack of engagement with the story's themes related to him, which is up to their choice. The story focuses more on Sunny's trauma in the end.. . Much easier to say he's evil (some) and annoying than to go into a topic of serious trauma and mental health issues, and their effects on different children. Basil was already messed up even before the event, so he's meant to be the most long-term troubled character there. His mind instantly going to hanging was surely related to all the hints we get that he's been wanting to do it to himself. As someone in psych, I know people who do relate with him and they're all mostly in a horrible state of mind. . . (I'm neutral as well, but it would seem disproportionate to an outside viewer, or some other new visitor who isn't on a raid. If someone does relate and sees this stuff, it could send a harmful message to a person possibly already self-harming. With the comments along the lines of "he already wants to kill himself anyways". People easily bite off more than they expect when they visit, and it's the breaking of that expectation that shocks them, but here it's taken as hostility, which ends up fostering some odd pro-anti war.). . . Aside from that, it's probably more just the hate circle meme train whatever that went in the rabbit hole and spiralled on the way down, just as with loads of other hate meme subs - it's more for the entertainment.. . In which case, sure.. . Thank you for coming to my TED talk,8
I just think he's annoying,5
It's for the meme + Ur mom,3
>!When he stabbed Sunny in the eye. That made me hate him more!<. . He’s also just generally annoying as a character.,2
Most basil haters usually just hate people who obsess over basil because they tend to ignore all the terrible shit he had done because he is their little flower boy while explaining how every other character is a piece of garbage. . . Tldr; basil stans are really fucking annoying,2
same honestly. i dont like him, but i also dont hate him. hes my least favorite character but i dont want to cucking skin him alive.,1
They are idiots who see him as god,5
So some people are part of the Basil cult that follow this sub to say something weird and then try to get themselves banned. And then most of the time, Anti Basil people are just having fun and making jokes.. . Sometimes we’re serious, and other times, we’re just having fun.,4
**agree**,3
That makes sense.,2
thank u,2
hmm yes,2
Welcome brother join us form the eradication of all basils,5
Yes!,2
Might wanna spoiler that...,1
Literally nothing is spoiler censored here i didn’t realize i had to sorry,2
Its okay,1
stupid watermelon boy stabbed out sunnys eye after traumatizingboth of them. and when mari was injured he didnt even call an ambulance or run to get an adult for help. he just decided she must be beyond saving and knew how to tie a noose at 12. what kid who isn't fucked up knows how to tie a noose and chooses to stage a suicide at 12? he knew all that but not that sunny wouldn't get in major legal trouble even for manslaughter as he was 12 and it was an accident.,15
He has the most punchable face,9
Eh, for me, it's more like:. . * He's one of the central characters of the entire game, being one of the reasons why Sunny managed to cover his manslaughter case as a suicide, but the game just focuses on the other three rather than him.. * His characterization of being a cute boy gone psychotic may or may not stick to people.. * His mental problems is widely interpreted as abusive clinging.. * Yeah, his shit with Mari is extremely hard to justify. Traumatized or not, his infinite retardation is still complicit with the act.. * He turned Sunny into a pirate.. . I don't like the bastard, but it's not like I'm gonna draw him getting clapped by the Marine Special Operations Command or anything.,7
My initial hatred came from the first time we meet everyone in headspace. I have had friends like him, the whole group protects him as this precious little baby who can do no wrong and he is constantly the victim in need of saving. He refuses to fight on the basis he is a gentle soul so just expects others to bend over backwards to protect him and keep him safe. He also went through the flower garden he agrees that part of the reason he assigns cactus to Kel is because he sees him as a prick. Uh??? Fuck you dude. He holds this esteem that he is a gentle soul who needs protecting but clearly internally isn’t at all like that. I get the whole trauma thing and that headspace is only sunnys portrayal of how he saw the dynamic but I personally would hate to be in that sort of friendship dynamic. I just really really hate people like him. I don’t even care about the whole mari situation. I can see why he did what he did in that situation. It’s just him as a person that makes me hate him.,7
Stabbed his friend in the eye and also decided to hang his sister not even considering that he should just call an ambulance. And don't try to justify it either, because it's fucked up.,5
Because we have our reasons! It's funny you asked, Basilwatermelon2 🔪,4
I want to curbstomp him, idk why.,10
Him hanging dead bodies up and causing everyone more pain and confusion. Like i don’t agree with the absolute hatred of him, but I’m tired of retards acting like he’s some smol cinnamon roll boy. Did you even play the game?,4
i want to rip his teeth out. I have no reasoning.,8
I wanna slit his face and see him suffer. Not sure why,7
Personal grudges. But also because >!he stabbed Sunny in the eye.!<,7
I wanna fucking eat his organs,3
The watermelon we call bagel has lied and tricked for long enough. sure omor did to but he apologized bagel didn't. So that is why we the people of the bagel hate community don't like that watermelon,3
ugly af,5
i think it's because he is gay,-1
I despise how the fandom infantilizes him and acts like he's an adorable little baby. Whenever I see stuff like this I want to murder him in the most brutal and disturbing way possible.  . . . Oh yeah, and the multiple crimes he committed.,1
I assume he learned how to tie nooses to hang up his plants,3
Bro Mari was already dead💀💀💀,-1
I thought they hanged Mari the next day,1
I agree with your points.,3
wdym by abusive clinging? just curious /gen,1
Kel was compared to a cactus since it could withstand anything, but like flowers, it might wilt if not properly cared for.,0
At least he apologized 🤷‍♀️,0
i like where this is going,3
🏃‍♀️,-1
I would not have written this if I hadn't played the game. I believe that what he did was way worse than what Sunny did, but I still love Basil. You gotta appreciate a good "antagonist" when it's done right. This sub reddit is proof of that.,0
Sunny was also flailing his knife around hurting Basil,0
You got me confused 😭,0
Bro, not to put another dude down, but he’s probably ten times better looking than you ever will be and you’re jealous,-4
He did it to defend Sunny,1
he's my little cinnamon roll with hopes and dreams to become a gardener 🥺,1
and he simply decided to use that knowledge to sudpend a dead girl's body,8
she could've had the possibility of surviving if they called an ambulance,4
A fall like that would have maybe broken a few bones, and I mean MAYBE, if she died from that fall she would have been a really tall infant, if they had called an ambulance so much of the shit that happened could have been avoided, but no, stupid little fucking flower boy decided "Sunny Sunny! We have to hang her dead body! Don't call the ambulance Sunny! We have to hang her Sunny! Sunny! What do you mean she could be alive?! Don't be silly! She's only 15 years old and fell down the stairs! What do you mean her bones aren't as soft as an infants!? Of course they are Sunny! Now get the jump rope and lets learn how to tie a noose!",2
Aubrey asks “is it because he’s a prick?” When basil says the cactus reminds him of Kel and he says “well.. that too”,2
Sorry for hanging the sister of sunny trying to frame it as a suicide when i could have called emergency services and to stab the eye of sunny bcs yes 😭,2
He didn’t have a knife, remember? Kel took it,4
This is another reason we want to kill the watermelon his fans are dumb,2
1. Cope he is not real. 2. Nah he still ugly as fuck my dude,7
Stfu, how about you character pfp user,1
Literally i think there would be no legal issues with that accident taking in court they were minors and no social consequences bcs it was an mf incident, but bcs he tried to frame it out as a suicide it now has legal and social consequences, so he didn't defend in any way sunny, he just made things worse because he is brain dead,1
You're not helping with the infantilization part,1
Duh,1
Basil didn't acknowledge it until Aubrey mentioned it, and I'm sure he didn't mean any harm.,0
He's iconic like that,1
Didn't Basil apologize a million times? Sunny/Omori hadn't once apologized,1
I know I know, it just annoyed me for him to put on this gentle angel persona and then insult Kel when Kel is one of the people who actively defends and protects him constantly without complaining. It was one of the things that reminded me of past friends. I know it’s not that deep. Just one of the reasons I personally don’t like Basil.,4
He apologized to much,2
Apologies dont solve things,1
omori fans when basil ISNT A REAL FUCKING PERSON,6
Could you tell me why the Anti Basil sub has suddenly got more popular in the past day? What happened on the Omori sub?,3
I believe it’s because someone made a post there saying not to come here,3
Ah, that makes sense now. Thanks for clearing that up.,2
They're "terrified" bcz of the gore drawings here. Besides having only 2,2
Yeah, the anti Basil sub has only the blender, gun, and watermelon death. That’s about it.,3
In fact the game itself has more basil gore than this server,3
yummy,1
That’s the most astonishing part. I have to question if Omori fans actually played the game when they say how “horrified” they are of this.,6
I think it's more that the game intends for you to be horrified when it happens, and not support it as happens here. That's what catches people off guard,2
That's what I was thinking, like bro have you not seen what they do to him in game.,2
This sub is intended to be anti Basil, so I don’t know what else you would expect here other than Basil fans raiding the sub.,3
I gave a simple analysis that intends to answer your statement without taking any sides. There's no argument to be had in this thread. I didn't say I expected anything, nor did I bring up raiding. . . Either way, they "raid" likely for the same reason, coming (and regretting) more out of curiosity than spite - they're clearly first-timers. Aside from that opposing sub where it's certainly more personal.,1
But I’m not arguing, I’m just telling you what you expect in a sub called Anti Basil. Yeah, you didn’t bring that up. I brought that up because I’ve been in this sub. Sorry if you felt threatened by my comment.,1
Aye and I'm simply telling you why people don't expect it (for some reason). It's more than they expect.. . It's like going to court for a murder case and still being shocked by what's shown, which happens. Why the downvote anyways? I'm not against you, and I don't see us disagreeing.,1
My bad. I’m used to downvoting in this sub because of the Basil fans. Let me fix it for you real quick.. . Edit: There, you’re good now 👍,1
Nice, I'm smack neutral and just like to look into why people respond the way they do. Seems like you've got some ongoing opposition with that other Basil sub ~~I haven't looked at yet~~,1
Honestly I don’t think any of it is genuine. Most of us are just here for playful fun.,6
he french,3
Bcs is a fucking psicopath that should be judged for its crimes,3
Stupid piece of shit takes up space in my spice cabinet as if it were use it for more than like two dishes 😡😡🤬😡🤬,2
they're homophobic,-1
Not all. I don’t HATE him, I just strongly dislike him.,3
Don't compare me to him... he is worst. We cut heads and kill fast and only for kings (some queen too). . >!We don't just hang someone because it didn't wake up in 4 to 5 hours.!<,2

I wrote a whole essay on why i hate basil before so ig I’ll just c&p it. .   >!Basil, the character from OMORI has done many things wrong. He has committed multiple crimes and has caused mental problems for his entire friend group. He’s a huge reason why after Mari died the group was in shambles. The evidence to all of this will be in the essay..   First of all, let’s start off with the crimes he’s committed. He has helped hide a body, which is the maximum penalty of twelve years in jail as it is a Class F Felony. He would also suffer an approximately twenty-five-thousand dollar fine. But, he didn’t stop his crimes there. Basil has committed assault against Sunny, which is a Class B Felony. Sunny’s friends were there thankfully and were able to get help in time. However, had they not been there Sunny would have died due to blood loss. Therefore, Basil assaulting Sunny may lead to a twenty-year prison sentence. Overall, Basil would have to spend at least thirty-two years in prison..   However, you could argue that Basil has the right to Legal Insanity and plead for a lower sentence. But, at the age of twelve, when he committed his first crime, he was in no such state of insanity. Unlike Sunny, he was not aggravated and unintentionally murdered his sister. Basil simply chose to frame her death as a suicide. Unlike Sunny, he should not be able to be excused due to Legal Insanity. .   Now, let’s start off with how he hurt Sunny. Sunny had already felt guilt for accidentally murdering his sister, but Basil had only increased such guilt. Sunny had to stay in his house for four whole years due to such guilt. Sunny felt guilty for Basil’s doings which led him to insanity and escapism. And the night that Sunny attempted to help Basil, was the night Basil betrayed him. Basil had stabbed him in the eye and other extreme bodily harm. Due to Basil causing such guilt for Sunny, he dropped out of high school, became malnourished, and had received almost impossible to fix mental damages. Basil continued to encourage Sunny to keep it a secret about the truth of Mari’s death and began gaslighting him into thinking that the only person who would forgive him would be himself..   Not only did he hurt Sunny, he also hurt the rest of his friend group; Kel, Hero, and Aubrey. Due to Basil’s actions Hero had begun to become a shut-in. Thankfully, he wasn’t nearly as far gone as Sunny, but he did have his moments. Such as snapping at his little brother Kel. Kel had been trying to help Hero, trying to encourage him to get out of bed and do something. But, due to the guilt in Hero because of Mari’s ‘suicide’ he screamed at Kel and claimed that Kel didn’t even love her and would never understand. Kel and Hero’s relationship had been close before, until Basil had framed a suicide. Kel and Hero became distant. Kel had decided to go make some new friends due to the death of one, the absence of one, and the neglectful brother he had. This led to Aubrey seeing Kel with new friends. Aubrey had already felt left behind by Aubrey and the sudden shock from feeling betrayed yet again had hit her. She was depressed, she couldn’t rely on anyone at home, and most certainly not the girl she had seen as her sister. Until Basil started clinging onto the only person he had left, Aubrey. Everyone else was busy, had no time for Basil, but Aubrey did. Basil clinged onto her like a leech, expecting everything to be alright now. However, that was not the case. Aubrey had found his photo album with Mari’s face scribbled out. Aubrey had been enraged and took all the photos with Mari out of the album. She had screamed at Basil and went home to never talk to him as a friend again. Throughout the entire time when Basil was sixteen and Sunny had come out, he played the victim. Acting like Aubrey was the big bully and never let her side of the story out. He made Aubrey an outcast to an already broken friend group..   Most importantly, Sunny would have most likely been forgiven for what he had done, by law and by his friends. Sunny never meant to push Mari and kill her. He was twelve and his emotions had gotten the better of him. His guilt clearly showed through him staying inside for years. Sunny should be able to claim Legal Insanity even before pushing Mari down the stairs. He was extremely stressed and being yelled at by his older sister did not help. He was always a quiet kid so if he committed a violent act, clearly something was wrong. Not only that, but it seems his father was either neglectful or abusive. The moment Mari had died, he left. Also, he has been neglected by his mother. The lack of food in the fridge and leaving him alone for days to deal with moving shouldn’t have taken as long as it did. She could’ve at least stopped by once, but all she did was call him and remind him to do his chores. Not even money was left for him to buy some food. .   Overall, this proves Basil is indeed a terrible human being and should be punished for his crimes. He was not a good friend and did not protect Sunny in any way. Therefore he should serve at least thirty years in prison with a chance of parole on top of his twenty-five thousand dollar fine.!<,13
He annoying. That’s it. I have the right to find people annoying and I make use of that right.,3
His character is annoying and his kinnies/fans/stans are even worse,5
Because it's funny. . I mean the old "Basil war" started in the first place because of a post about a gif of blending his sprite up with a "fuck you" written in broken English, so I am pretty sure many of us aren't being that serious about it.,3
